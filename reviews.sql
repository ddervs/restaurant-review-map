It’s a beautiful name, redolent of nearby Kew Gardens and natural abundance, although, by sheer chance, it is also the exact same name as the restaurant in The Menu, the recent Ralph Fiennes horror-satire about a murderous chef. We can, however, move quickly past this, because chef and co-owner Josh Hunter certainly means his guests no harm. No deaths occurred while I was there. It was Kew on a Saturday evening, after all, and the place was filled to bursting with the sort of jocund, elegant sorts who favoured the Glasshouse in the 23 years leading up to its closure last September. The Hungry Horse in Basildon this is not; we’re talking three courses for £65 at dinner – for example, oxtail ravioli with a winter vegetable ragout and bone marrow crumb, followed by Ryeland hogget and forced rhubarb souffle with stem ginger ice-cream. This is fine dining, but not the painfully fancy sort with which, by course nine, you find yourself staring at a bowl of fluid gels on an aerated bisque and wondering when real dinner will get going. The Glasshouse stayed open for so very long because it was classy, never edgy and had more of a neighbourhood vibe than a Noma one. People who loved it will warm to Hawthorn, too, because they’ve changed very little– not even the tables and chairs. It’s still a dramatically bright, single room in which there are no nooks or booths to hide, with tables close enough to hear your neighbours’ primary school admissions woes and who has stolen whose babysitter gossip. Take that hogget: some of it’s served pink with crisp fat, and there’s some shoulder meat smoked over fir, silky jerusalem artichoke, sweet onion petals and a rich, madeira sauce. The dish is aesthetically sublime, yes, but it’s also a very good roast dinner. I’m still perplexed as to what, exactly, Hunter did to the very good tiger prawn that came grilled in ’nduja butter and with delicate, pale pieces of pickled cucumber and a heavenly, buttermilk-and-dill dressing, but it’s one of the sweetest, plumpest, most sating things I’ve eaten all year. Front of house is in the safe hands of the other co-owner, Patra Panas, who knows every square foot of this joint intimately, having worked at the Glasshouse for years, and there’s a strong sense that she has taken the reins and changed the name to make it very much hers and Hunter’s, but without wishing to chase away the goodwill spun by Nigel Platts-Martin and Bruce Poole before them. This is still a mature, special-occasion restaurant with Phillipponnat champagne at £15 a glass and cultured butter that’s served on a shiny pebble to go with homemade sourdough (essential for mopping up the blood-orange-and-oyster dressing from a plate of cured scallop and gilt-head bream with herb tempura). The best dish on the current menu is the Cornish monkfish with chicken skin butter that comes with cime di rapa and hazelnuts. The whole thing is fishy, salty, buttery ecstasy, and aims to fill and soothe. I also hope to return for the tarte tatin of roast shallots with a Wigmore cheese fondue and a walnut-and-pickled-apple dressing. Ingredients are distinctly British, but they’re made with a gesture to Italian and French cuisine – roast veal rump, for instance, comes with truffled potatoes and grilled calçots, and the cod with risotto al nero di seppia (or cuttlefish ink risotto to the likes of you and me). And, just as things seem to be getting a little highfalutin, there’s that rhubarb souffle and a server clutching a spoon of the finest stem ginger ice-cream and asking delicately – even though there is no delicate way to ask this – if he can stuff it in the hole. When, in my twilight, Barbara Cartland years, I’m lying on a chaise longue, clutching an armpit chihuahua and dictating books about my restaurant exploits, one tome will be devoted to “Souffles wot I have loved”, and Hawthorn’s pale pink, quivering beauty will definitely be getting a mention. We also had some cultured yoghurt with cured pineapple and mango honey, which might have been a health food if it hadn’t turned up with some warm vanilla beignets. Hawthorn isn’t for fickle new-restaurant-opening-chasers who want to take a selfie next to a disco glitter ball in the loo. It’s for locals with lovely things to celebrate, who want Panas to look after them like a friend and Hunter to cook them a dinner of such quality that they really won’t mind when the bill’s a little chunky, because every mouthful was worth it. Hawthorn may be the epitome of safety, but it is also probably one of the restaurants of the year. • Hawthorn 14 Station Parade, Kew, 020-8940 6777. Open Tues-Sat, lunch noon-2.15pm, dinner 6-9.45pm.

Freshly opened with a £3m-plus fit-out, it resembles nothing so much as the Starship Enterprise, albeit one with geishas on the walls and a £110 seven-course menu (or £150 for 11) cooked by Michael Shaw, formerly of Gordon Ramsay Inc and Raymond Blanc’s Le Manoir aux Quat’Saisons. Abandon reading this review here, all who have already taken terrible umbrage that Musu even exists. Personally, I am rather cheered that there are still people north of Watford who have the faith and gumption to open places as pointedly bonkers as this. Musu is a gigantically ambitious project serving what its owners hope to be the highest-quality contemporary Japanese food in a city that is already pretty well favoured with good and reasonably pan-Asian dining choices of every kind. Vincent Braine and Marius Kamara clearly have big dreams, bigger investment and extensive notes on what diners are spending their cash on in 2023. The luxury side of the Manchester dining scene is seemingly thriving, with the likes of 20 Stories and Australasia already hugely popular. Musu – whose tagline is “infinite possibilities” – with its glossy black exterior that leads to plush, bottle-green booths and a bold, brass-latticed bar, serves cocktails from about £14 a throw and Japanese Yamazaki malt whisky at £45 a glass. Dinner is A5-grade wagyu beef and sustainable blue-fin tuna eaten in a 55-cover restaurant that is as dark in places as Adrian Mole’s bedroom, though there are also Japanese murals, globe lighting and a nakedly open kitchen with a dozen chefs on full display. After 11pm, via a “theatre production set-up” (whatever one of those is), Musu transforms into a nightclub/izakaya and turns up the music even louder than it is at 7pm, which is already fairly lively. On a Friday night in February, the place was mobbed, both the restaurant and the glass-fronted private dining room that, at the touch of a button, turns frosted – though, if you ask me, isn’t the whole point of going somewhere like Musu that you want to be seen there anyway? If you’ve already decided to boycott Musu over the sheer cost, the din and the small portions, I must at this point stress that the food is outstanding. Shaw, his kitchen brigade and front of house could not be more primed and ready to take on Manchester. This is Japanese food served in the manner of Le Manoir and, while there won’t be a great deal of it, it will linger in your mind. Every bowl is a minuscule portion of exquisite pleasure. First, tuna tartare rolled in cucumber skin, with teeny cucumber plinths hosting dots of caviar and a suggestion of toasted rice. Then three of the finest pieces of sashimi imaginable – akami, hamachi and salmon – each of them so delicious that I felt like handing my badge back there and then – it’s over; I won’t ever taste better. They were followed by nigiri otoro and red mullet, both also outstanding. The next course was a scallop with smoked bacon dashi that I’d not thought through beforehand or asked to change, because neither Charles nor I eat pork, but they deftly swapped it for some wagyu beef with black truffle and beetroot tea. No faff, no fuss, just smoothly shifted to something equally good. Musu also does black cod on cauliflower puree with yet more caviar. Some people turn up their noses at black cod, not least because it’s all a bit Cheryl Cole at Nobu in 2010, but I love it unashamedly for it infantilising sweetness. Also, cod as fine as this is always a treat, especially with a puree so remarkable. By the time we got to the venison with miso aubergine, I was definitely still hungry, but our seven courses were up. Very rarely – in fact, never – do I wish I’d chosen the longer tasting menu, though at £150 plus drinks, that would have been guaranteed to cause a reader revolt. Which prompts the question: who are all these people in Musu? Where are they getting their money? None of them seemed to be the type to have Brink’s-Mat gold buried at the bottom of their garden. So I ate my dessert of salted white chocolate loveliness that was somewhere between a mousse, a ganache and a panna cotta, and also featured hints of almond and a scattering of something crumbly and sablé-esque. Miso chocolate petits fours were so good that I immediately mourned their passing, and the server felt sorry for me and went and begged two more. Sure, Musu isn’t for everybody, but if someone else is funding your wanton extravagance, then drag them there. It’s unforgettable for many reasons: some of them are hilarious, yes, but mostly they’re just plain good. Musu Rational House, 64 Bridge Street, Manchester M3, 0161-883 7753.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(5,'2023-02-03T12:00:01Z','Notto, London W1: ‘Pasta is safe in these chefs’ hands’ | Grace Dent on restaurants','One challenge for the weekly restaurant reviewer is that several times a year you’re expected to produce riveting prose on the basic art of eating pasta in a room painted in contrasting beiges. Not that I’m complaining about eating pasta; it’s almost unthinkable not to worship the stuff. Pasta is so delicious that I’ve even heard modern nutritionists describe it as more of a “social activity” than mere sustenance: all those lovely, starchy carbs with cream, oil and/or butter gliding down your throat, making you feel full and loved, but not a huge amount of vitamin K, omega-3s or anything else that may help you live to 100. And, judging from the sight of a full restaurant on a wet Tuesday lunchtime, I am guessing that many of Notto’s customers that day had briefly considered longevity and instead opted for a luscious bowl of handmade strozzapreti (AKA priest chokers) with black truffles, mushroom stock, parmesan and butter, or pappardelle with oxtail and beef shin slow-cooked in red wine, and a mascarpone blood orange panna cotta for afters. Notto is an elegant, mid-price pasta joint that feels to me like a prototype for a potential dozen more Nottos up and down the land. It isn’t remotely revolutionary or gimmicky, and there’s no big twist on pasta, but what it does have is a menu by Phil Howard and Louis Korovilas, two chefs I rate very highly. Howard is one of those chef’s chefs, who worked at Harvey’s with Marco Pierre White and Bibendum with Simon Hopkinson before opening The Square, where he got two Michelin stars. His Chelsea restaurant Elystan Street is stonkingly good, though a double-baked, cave-aged cheddar soufflé will set you back £32 and an oxtail raviolo a mere £30, so maybe find someone to take you. Everything at Elystan Street is delicious, but also exceedingly expensive, so the news that Notto offers slightly more pocket-friendly pasta is thrilling. Especially because Korovilas is also on board. I first chanced upon him at Bancone in Covent Garden, a reliably lovely restaurant now close to my family’s heart. Pasta is safe in these chefs’ hands, even if there is very little at Notto to get het up about. It’s just good, fresh pasta cooked in an open kitchen. It’s certainly nothing like the recently opened Jacuzzi in Kensington, part of the Big Mamma group that also runs Gloria, Circolo Popolare and Ave Mario , a gargantuan, mock-Italian mansion with added puttanesca con tonno crudo, a “disco toilet” with a mirror ball and 100 exuberant Italian servers, some of whom recreated the Last Supper for the launch. No, the semi-organised chaos of TikTok playpen Jacuzzi is a million miles from staid old Notto, which feels more like somewhere you’d take a visiting aunt or someone with whom you actually want to talk properly. I went with my friend Hugh, and we stayed almost three hours, righting the wrongs of modern life over shared bowls of rather good, utterly devourable rigatoni cacio e pepe, the aforementioned pappardelle, which was a fine example of this now rather commonly found classic, and a very interesting campanelle, which was vegan, though you’d never have guessed it, because it was swimming in a ludicrously rich concoction of winter greens, soft red onion, garlic, chilli, capers and a generous glug of quality olive oil. Marvellous. Drinkers may like the grapefruit negroni or the signature cocktail, the Notto 198, which features bourbon, champagne, lemon juice and absinthe. Being the type of woman who plans to live longer than a giant Galápagos tortoise, I was on their sparkling filtered water included in the £1.50 cover fee, but, even so, it was impossible not to feel slightly louche when tackling the grissini with melted lardo di colonnata from the snacks section. Three long breadsticks are wrapped in pale pink pork fat, dusted in parmesan and served, comically, upright and impossible to eat and stay remotely lady-like. On balance, there were no huge fails at Notto and I’ll keep it up my sleeve for a return visit some time. Sure, there’s the same shrink-flation going on here as in all other restaurants right now – burrata with winter leaves, for example, was in fact half a small cheese that didn’t ooze, and wild mushroom “arancini” – note the plural – turned out to be a singular, albeit delicious arancino. Pudding was a “chocolate and hazelnut cream” that was essentially a small bowl of pleasant mousse; not to be sniffed at, but nothing to write home about, either, especially from a dessert menu that has only two options other than vanilla or chocolate ice-cream. Notto is very much a restaurant opening of its time: a hopeful and confident debut in a landscape where diners still dearly want to eat out at smaller, serious restaurants, but at the same time have to accept shorter menus and cost-vigilant dishes. We live in uncertain times, but I wish Notto well. If these really are the last days of Rome, we may as well go down eating pasta. Notto 198 Piccadilly, London W1, 020-3034 2190.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(6,'2023-02-10T12:00:07Z','Samphire, Lymington, Hampshire: ‘An eruption in a Cath Kidston outlet’ | Grace Dent on restaurants','Samphire is a cacophony of bold, floral wallpapers, Kia-Ora-orange chairs, sage banquettes, fuchsia scatter cushions and accent lamps. The interior designers of the newly renovated Stanwell House boutique hotel in Lymington, Hampshire, were very brave, and have come up with a sort of “eruption in a Cath Kidston outlet” vibe, which I rather loved, not least because I often bemoan restaurants that are decked out in risk-free shades of beige, tapioca and silt, as if the management were neither committing to a theme, nor confident of staying open for very long at all. There’s none of that meekness at Samphire, though. From the off, the place screams: “We are one of the poshest restaurants in the New Forest, but we’re not one of those aloof, Scandi, trial-by-dinner spots where you have to pretend that live ants and raw duck offal are delicious. No, we’re just doing fish and potatoes and the like. Aunty Bertha will be completely safe here.” Stanwell House’s refurbishment has resulted in three different dining options. There’s also the Salt Bar and the Orangery, which don’t take themselves too seriously and were packed with guests on the Saturday I visited, all of them eating club sandwiches, brisket and bone-marrow burgers, meze-style sharing boards and plates of doughnuts with coffee espuma for dipping. Meanwhile, Samphire, the fancier offering, which serves red-deer carpaccio, Shetland scallops and Lymington picked crab, was deserted. Or at least it was until we arrived; later, another couple arrived on a date, every word of whose conversation I could hear from six tables away (Sir, you were “friend-zoned” weeks ago; it was as unmissable as Samphire’s bottle-green, mock-Vaudeville wall lamps – sorry). Samphire may struggle to attract daytime diners because it feels instinctively way more formal and fussy than its counterparts. In truth, though, the prices in all three options are roughly the same. That bar menu brisket burger is all of £18, while the chicken kiev with wilted greens, parsley emulsion and dauphine potatoes is £22. Meanwhile, in the posh bit that is Samphire, peppered fillet and belly of pork with pineapple puree and cavolo nero is £26, although you’d probably need a side of triple-cooked chips with that, which is an extra £5. By and large, everything at Stanwell is rather expensive wherever you perch your bottom, but at least at Samphire you can eat your red-shrimp risotto with tomato pearls in the light from the pretty courtyard and the service involves a tad more tugging of the forelock. The risotto was gorgeous, by the way. No risotto, in 2023, can be truly groundbreaking, because it is merely damp rice with aspirations, but this was a butterscotch-coloured pool of loveliness with four large prawns atop a scattering of sea herbs. Similarly, in the current upmarket-dining landscape, Samphire’s scallops in coriander oil and curry emulsion are nothing surprising, yet they were executed with aplomb and came in a guzzle-worthy sauce. Will I ever come back here? No. It is pretty and perfunctory. Am I glad it exists, and that other people can enjoy it? Yes. That said, do not order the chalk stream trout “pastrami”, because it is trout encrusted in sunflower seeds and served on a large, brown smear. I shall one day be awarded a damehood for services to ridding the British dining scene of all unsightly plate smears. Thank me later. The catch of the day was a sole with its face and spine intact, but it was beautifully judged, with a honey-brown surface and the flakes just so, and armed with béarnaise sauce, confit garlic and lemon samphire. Another main of sea bass with leeks, celery and celeriac crumble was, at best, inoffensive. There is skilled, judicious cooking happening here, but there are also a lot of slightly old-hat ideas delivered in an instantly forgettable way. Everything sweet that I saw looked delicious, from the Orangery’s pretty afternoon tea towers with their orange and cranberry scones, finger sandwiches and salted caramel choux buns to the dark chocolate and gingerbread marquise I tore through, lapping up the spiced rum creme fraiche. There’s also a honey cake with honey curd, honey ice-cream and milk panna cotta that they call, rather adorably, “To the Land of Milk and Honey”. This is a boutique hotel that doesn’t skimp on the modern chintz, and where you could tear through the cash without ever being overwhelmed with emotion over the food or the service. Even so, you would be deeply grateful to be here, because the soft furnishings are so richly vibrant and, in winter 2023, everything outside its windows is so thoroughly depressing. Yes, on balance, I’d rather be inside Samphire than out, eating the honey cake, enjoying the pleasantness and waiting for better days.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(7,'2022-12-30T12:00:48Z','‘They begged me to keep it secret’ – Grace Dent’s favourite restaurants of 2022','If we’re doing 2022’s highs and lows, let’s begin by staring bravely at the negative. “Terrible food, and such small portions” is the bane of the current restaurant scene. Never has so little been arranged so flamboyantly to fool the eye. Once upon a time, the word “anchovy”, “crumpet” or “prawn” on a menu meant that said ingredient was served in the plural. Now, however, you can expect a solitary anchovy draped across a slice of bread for £9, or a single prawn cut into three. See also pasta in 100g portions and “skewers”, which these days translates as a small piece of protein on a stick for £11. I smiled empathetically throughout 2022’s price hikes and portion shrinkages, until the other week at a gastropub in Lakeland, when my chicken parfait turned up with one Lilliputian crumpet not much wider than a £2 coin, for which they charged me nearly £15. At this point, I began to give off sparks. But who wants to focus on the bad news? Here, instead, are some of the year’s experiences that I treasure, the places where I’d be delighted if someone wangled me a table. For example, The Plimsoll in Finsbury Park, which is the slightly chaotic yet priceless uncut gem of the London pub food scene, serving a gloriously sloppy burger, ricotta cheesecake and pints of Guinness. It is far from posh, though, so for high-class let’s take a goûter, or tasting menu, at Cédric Grolet at The Berkeley, where for a mere £120 a succession of handsome French staff deliver Grolet’s hallmark sugary trompe-l’œil to your lips: the vanilla flower, the hazelnut, the lemon and his take on a scone with jam. If this all seems very That London, a trip to Cafe 52 in Aberdeen will soon ground us. The owner famously cannot stand Guardian readers, which made my solo lunch of Normandy chicken casserole followed by a crumpet bread-and-butter pudding all the more delicious. Also fabulous was Bassenthwaite Lake Station, close to Cockermouth in Cumbria, where the afternoon tea is incapacitating and served in a gorgeous replica French steam train. My family, who live close by, begged me to keep its sharing platters of local salami, baked brie and cumberland sauce a secret, but I couldn’t. Another example of wholesome, fairytale loveliness is Updown near Deal in Kent, where on warm summer days they served braised courgettes, fresh mozzarella and boozy rum baba in a spellbinding English country garden. Back in London, three other restaurants I send everyone to are Tatale, The Baring and The Tamil Prince. At Akwasi Brenya-Mensa’s Tatale, order the omo tuo mashed rice dumpling in spicy nkatenkwan groundnut soup, because it will soothe your soul. If you can get into The Tamil Prince in Barnsbury – it’s just a small, one-roomed pub – order the whole menu, and two of the pulled beef uttapum, a spongey dosa the consistency of a Scotch pancake that comes with a glorious, spicy coconut chutney. The Baring meanwhile, also in Islington, is probably one of the capital’s openings of 2022, but it has been slightly overshadowed by several huge, soulless, heavily hyped Mayfair behemoths offering slapdash nonsense to the morally adrift. Even so, the Baring’s quail shish with garlic yoghurt and pul biber and its warm almond financier with cherries lift pub grub to a higher form. That said, if you simply want to shove excellent food unthinkingly into your face, write the word “Miznon” on the back of your hand and rush to Soho for its “Deep Satisfaction” pitta stuffed with long-cooked brisket, melted cheddar, pickled chillies and gherkin. No one visits Miznon just the once. Return for the run-over potato dripping with butter and the rosehip syrup-drowned malabi pudding alone. For slightly more sophisticated fun, there’s also the Aussie hang-out Milk Beach, where the prawn toast is hefty and the coffee and banana negronis extremely one-moreish. Let’s end with some of 2022’s best special-occasion meals. Tallow in Tunbridge Wells was faultless, with Donna and Rob Taylor’s new home fulfilling all my hopes, and feeding me a “chocolate and hazelnut brownie” masquerading as a plinth of rich mousse in a glistening pool of salted caramel and miso. Solstice in Newcastle was by far my longest tasting menu of the year, coming in at 18 plates plus extras, but Kenny and Abbie Atkinson’s charm and ingenuity make it an experience of delicious incarceration. And if you win EuroMillions over the holidays, celebrate with the full 13-course dinner at Amethyst in Mayfair, served on a table that might have come from the Starship Enterprise, where chef Carlo Scotto is redefining fancy dining while taking £250 out of your wallet if you order the wagyu plate and cheese course. Finally, if there has to be one “winner winner Grace Dent’s dinner”, it has to be The Dog &amp; Gun in Skelton, a country pub with an ancient heart serving a fancy menu without airs and graces. Take me back to its twice-baked torpenhow souffle with a liberal grating of black truffle. Yes, 2022 may have been stingy at times, but overall it was delicious, so here’s to more heartburn in 2023.','https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/dec/30/they-begged-me-to-keep-it-secret-grace-dents-favourite-restaurants-of-2022','Grace Dent','‘They begged me to keep it secret’ – Grace Dent’s favourite restaurants of 2022',-2.45438910000000021,54.2776946999999907,0.421499999999999985);

Much like the Ottomans spying Vlad the Impaler on yonder knoll, no kitchen brigade hopes to be invaded and skewered on their opening week. The etiquette of when is too early to judge a new spot is much debated. Some restaurants run a trial period called a soft opening, which isn’t as rude as it sounds. Visiting when they are “on soft” means you may get duck ragu pappardelle down your back and a crying server, but a smaller bill to cover the chaos. Beckford Canteen, on the other hand, had served a friends-and-family function for one evening only when I happened to be in Bath and needed to be fed. My dilemma was that the menu was a delicious paean to modern British classics and comfort foods: chestnut soup, Welsh rarebit, monkfish with curried butter and sides such as confit potato. There was an apple, sourdough and clotted cream riff on bread pudding that attracted me like an ant towards a blob of jam on a worktop. This is a menu that demands to be gobbled up, rather than cogitated over for three and a half hours. Confit pork belly comes with celeriac, and a roast venison dish with spruce tips and more celeriac. Yes, there is a lot of celeriac on British menus right now. As a nation, we have gone, within 12 months, from rarely seeing celeriac to being offered it more than a Belgian donkey. This overlooked, knobbly, whiskery lump of softly scented vitamin K and fibre is having a moment. I adore the stuff when cooked by a professional chef, though my own attempts at celeriac remoulade have lacked the deliciousness of what I get in France. However, at Beckford Canteen it felt that chef George Barson was a person to trust with such matters. Barson was executive chef at Kitty Fisher’s in Shepherd Market, London, which opened in 2014 and has remained one of London’s most gorgeous places to be treated to roast lamb rump. It and sister restaurant Cora Pearl in Covent Garden are casually elegant with an old-fashioned edge, rock-solid, dependable spots to wine and dine. Barson helped build the reputation of both. He also worked with Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall at the River Cottage Kitchen, Nuno Mendes at Viajante and at Dinner with Heston. Perhaps now you’ll forgive me for showing up at Beckford Canteen before they’d got the price tags off some of the pans. We snuck in at 6.30pm: all 40 seats for the evening in this pleasantly intimate former Georgian greenhouse were sold twice over. Two large tables of friends celebrated birthdays along each side of the room; it was a situation that would break most serving staff on launch weekend, but the delightful Ollie Sutton and his team ran things with razor-sharp alacrity. There were rye old fashioneds in tins and hunks of oozy rarebit, titivated with pickled onion, draped prettily so it looked a little like a cheesy stained-glass window. Good sardines arrived on toast. Only two of them, mind, but for £7, these days it felt like generosity. The chestnut soup was luxurious and balm-like. I wish chestnuts would have their celeriac day in the sun. Right now, it feels as if only me, Barson and squirrels appreciate them. A starter of smoked eel, leek and egg yolk was perfectly wobbly, smoky and softened in all the right places. Not a lot of eel, to be quite frank – in fact, laughably little – but that is the lie of the restaurant landscape right now. Already shaping up to be one of my dishes of 2023 is the astutely judged monkfish served with a silky curried butter and those concertina-style confit potatoes that some say were invented by the Farringdon’s Quality Chop House, although I cannot prove this. Whoever dreamed up this method of adding so much oil to carbohydrate while retaining crispness needs an order of chivalry bestowed at Buckingham Palace. They made me a biscuity chocolate mousse dessert festooned with sweet, crisp jerusalem artichoke shavings that made my heart sing, then turned my table so politely that I didn’t even notice I was out of the door. I have since told everyone I meet who is going anywhere near Somerset to visit Beckford Canteen. That’s the purest recommendation imaginable. I want people I like to be fed there.

In times of yore, it was a regular pitstop for my gang before an evening’s shimmying to Jamiroquai at the nearby Pagoda nightclub. We went to Casa Romana for a stomach-lining bowl of carbonara, warm frizzante and a laugh. This was real Italian food, I thought, until my head was later turned by Anna Del Conte and Rose Gray breathing into my ear that food from Puglia, Florence or Sicily could be delicate and required cogitation, deft seasoning and a fine soffritto base. I learned that lentils, white beans and dressed leaves were authentic, and that salmon fillet in sambuca probably wasn’t. I also learned that expecting an Italian restaurant to serve dough balls was rather gauche, apparently, and that bread in my ribollita was how humble peasants lived and they loved it. I still love places like Casa Romana regardless. Large, heaving, far from London, with not a whiff of pretension and a “happy hour” from lunch until 6pm every Saturday, when they serve three courses for £16.75. Locanda Locatelli in Marylebone this is not – and thank God, because last time I was there, the bill arrived and I removed my glasses hoping that a smear of linguine all’astice on my bifocals had made the green salad seem to cost £18.50. In these current testing times, even those who are well-versed in Neapolitan techniques or Antonio Carluccio’s tomes are creeping back to brilliant places like Casa Romana: high-street restaurants with wipeable menus, breaded garlic mushrooms, enormous pepper pots and, in some cases, serving staff who, you suspect, are not a fraction as Italian-sounding when they’re talking in the kitchen. These places are a far cry from the River Cafe, where you sit downwind of the Beckhams and Stanley Tucci, but they will make you a decent mozzarella and ham calzone, and a honeycomb ice-cream bombe for afters. Americans call them “mom and pop restaurants”, which may be a pejorative term to food-scene people, but to me sounds cosy as hell. Yes, Casa Romana is safe, but over the decades it has also moved with its audience, tweaking its menu to provide pizza and pasta for gluten-free and dairy-free types – they’ll do vegans the likes of good, chargrilled melanzane or spaghetti arrabiata with jalapeños. One of the highlights of the current menu is the understated bruschetta forza, loaded with a mountain of sweet tomato perched on a layer of sun-dried tomato sauce and doused in olive oil. For the anything-goes brigade, meanwhile, there’s budino nero, or fat bullets of breaded Cumbrian black pudding with red onion marmalade and very good honey mustard sauce; and delicious, plump gamberoni cooked in butter, chilli and ’nduja. Nothing at Casa Romana is dainty or tweezered, but it is enjoyable. Massimo Bottura will never trouble his Osteria Francescana menu with the likes of baked pollo piccante – a large, roaringly red bowl of chicken breast baked in a spicy ragu to be enjoyed by scooping through the mush with garlic bread and pushing it into your face while simultaneously slurping a glass of chianti. But those three-star Michelin places are a lot poorer for this lack of largesse. (Incidentally, Casa Romana’s house red is a drinkable South African shiraz at just over five quid a glass, though I had a Peroni Zero.) The starters are better than the mains. We shared a pizza pescatore with prawns, mussels and calamari on a garlic butter base, which was adequate, but not particularly memorable. Much better was the pizza bianco with a carbonara sauce base and a generous scattering of chicken, prosciutto and salami. We shared a whiffing, goat’s cheese-laden risotto calabrese with broccoli that, again, wasn’t refined, but was not rejected, either. There is a Cumberland sticky toffee pudding on the dessert menu that is a playful interpretation of the one made in Cartmel. However, the £4.50 dolcetti menu is a positive boon, because it means you can load the table with these “small treats” under the guise that you plan to share them – warm chocolate brownie, a rather good, boozy tiramisu, a riff on Eton mess, say – before making a land grab for the lot. I recently lusted over Basque cheesecake, and sneered at people who like “normal” cheesecake with its buttery biscuit base and oozing fruit coulis. Basque is where it’s at, I said only two weeks ago, so why did I inhale Casa Romana’s mascarpone and mango cheesecake with its crumbly bottom and sunset-coloured, teeth-chatteringly sugary fruit sauce, served with whipped cream, scraping the bowl like a labrador? It is a woman’s prerogative to change her mind, and anyway, Casa Romana does not need my feedback. I hope they change absolutely nothing. They’ve stood upright since 1993.

First, it is not a vast, laughably expensive, 200-seater, all-day, mock-Mediterranean bistro, which is what just about every investor is backing these days, knowing that a fool and his £28 for substandard, citrus-doused carpaccio are easily parted. Second, it is a Jamaican vegan restaurant that serves fake goat curry, barbecue jerk plantain and saltfish that is certainly not fish. This is unusual. Sure, Jamaican vegan food should probably be more commonplace, if one thinks about it logically. I’ll show my workings: Jamaica has the world’s largest Rastafarian community; Rastafarians follow an Ital meat-free diet; and Britain is home to many vegans, Jamaicans and Jamaican food-lovers, not to mention Rastafarians. So you’d think that, somewhere along the way, plant-based brown stew “fish” or macaroni “cheese” with fake bacon might have become mainstream. Instead, Jordan Johnson, Jam Delish’s co-founder, found it tough to find decent versions of his favourite Jamaican food, so began during lockdown as a dark delivery kitchen in Wimbledon, before appearances as a market stall and a residency in Soho’s The Sun &amp; 13 Cantons, where the likes of Raheem Sterling, Common, Lily James and the stars of the Black Panther movie franchise reportedly enjoyed the Jam Delish experience. Now, it has found a permanent home and is fronted by Jamie Oliver’s Fifteen alumnus Nathan Collymore. And the new place is the opposite of po-faced. It plays loud Jocelyn Brown, D Train and Nights Over Egypt by the Jones Girls. There’s a sophisticated cocktail menu serving Antiguan zombies and amaretto sours, as well as a “shooter” section including Jägerbombs and slippery nipples (AKA sambuca and Baileys) that I have not seen since a 1992 girls’ holiday to Playa de las Américas in Tenerife. They also sell Boost Energy, and one entire side of the restaurant is a “living greenery” wall made of artificial foliage. If all that makes Jam Delish sound noisy, young and slightly odd, well, it is a bit, but on a miserable Tuesday night in January, it was hectic, while many other places nearby had a graveyard feel. And, frankly, Collymore is a vibrant talent and a gamechanger for the vegan cooking scene. Good plant-based dining is about textures, contrasts, balance, plating and, above all, making natural items such as lentils, plantains and oyster mushrooms the stars of the show. At Jam Delish, Collymore rather humiliates the likes of Mildred’s and Lewis Hamilton’s Neat Burger by serving up complex, visually lovely, yet hearty plates of “oxtail” stew brimming with jackfruit, wild mushrooms, butter beans, plantain, sweet potato and herb cassava dumplings. Or a “nibble” of grilled roti with three generous dishes of jerk baba ghanoush, plantain hummus and a wondrous burnt spring onion and chilli butter. The cooking makes you keep asking: “But how? How is this happening without butter, cream, stock or, well, meat?” Because vegan food is so often dreary. It can be so dry, it would choke a dromedary, or, worse still, it can look utterly delicious, yet taste like polystyrene. I have eaten enough of this well-meaning but ultimately awful nonsense in my long, windy lifetime to know genius when I see it, and Jam Delish’s fried “chicken” with ackee and green lentils is just that, all sitting around a large, griddled slice of soft Caribbean squash, with a small jug of dark, intense and drinkable Jamaican gravy alongside. Callaloo and codfish comes with sticky grilled confit yams and scotch bonnet sauce made with sweetened coconut. Possibly my favourite dish, however, is the Caribbean fish tacos, which are delightful, soft-shell tortillas with lemon pepper-glazed tofu “codfish”, pickle de gallo, pineapple and mango. In truth, haters of fake meat products such as seitan, tofu, TVP and the rest will have issues with Jam Delish, because they feature throughout the menu, but mainly to add realism rather than flavour. The real pleasure is in the glossy sauces, the heat and the crunch. It’s in the expert use of garlic, thyme, peanut and pomegranate. And in the bizarrely meaty buttermilk oyster mushrooms, deep-fried and served with sweet plantain ketchup and green avocado puree. And lest you think pudding is just some drab vegan sorbet, no, there’s also a sumptuous chocolate ice-cream sandwich made with rich rum cake, chocolate banana ice-cream, chocolate soil and a potent Guinness punch sauce. Jam Delish won’t be to everyone’s taste, but if it’s to yours and you want the meat-free version of Montego Bay’s finest offerings, this is hearty, spicy, accomplished and memorable cooking. Save me a spot by the plastic aspidistras. Jam Delish 1 Tolpuddle Street, London N1. Open Tues-Fri 5-10.30pm, Sat noon-10.30pm, Sun 1-7pm.

Small plates £9-£16, large plates £18-£31, desserts £14, wines from £28 Alhaji Suya, 15 Peckham Park Road, London SE15 6TR and Walworth and Greenwich Experience teaches us that more expensive does not always mean better. Even so, sometimes these things must be tested. Which is why I’m sitting in a Zipcar on a Peckham sidestreet, with a foil takeaway container on my lap, trying not to make a mess. The foil box contains a fold of pink greaseproof paper, filled in turn with soft lozenges of thickly spice-dusted barbecue beef. In the warmth of the makeshift paper bag the dry spice mix has become soft. No worries. I have more in a transparent sachet. It’s the colour of ground rust. I throw it on liberally while trying not to get any on the seats. Zipcar-member etiquette is a minefield and I’m sure that spraying deep orange West African spice mixes all over the driver’s seat is a big no-no, even if in the service of culinary self-education. I jab away at the beef with my little wooden fork. Gosh. It’s a joyously bold hit of chilli and garlic and smokiness, all underwritten by the sweetness of ground peanut. This is only the second time I have tried suya, the famed Nigerian way with smoked or barbecued beef, lamb and chicken. Other meats are available. I had always suspected it would be my kind of thing. I’m a sucker for the vivid interaction of meat, fire and spice, and was frankly baffled that I had not tried it. It was a gross omission on my part. Now I’ve discovered I love it, which is a relief. Because the first time I tried suya just a couple of days ago, at the West African restaurant Isibani, in fancy Knightsbridge, I had been a picture of pouting, school kid disappointment. The skewered folds of beef served there had been dry and flavourless, unless introduced to the pile of spices sitting far to the side of a plate, like an overly exuberant party guest kept away from everyone else for fear they’ll disgrace themselves. I frowned at the plate in front of me. The fact is, I lacked reference points. The next day I asked Jimi Famurewa, restaurant critic of the London Evening Standard, whose family is Nigerian, to recommend somewhere for the good stuff. He sent me to Alhaji Suya, a small group of Nigerian takeaways across southeast London, where a sizable portion costs £8.99 as against the £12 at Isibani. Jimi knows what he’s talking about. Alhaji Suya is great. That said, Isibani is mostly great, too, if you can forgive the suya, which some people simply won’t. But I can, on account of the pepper soup. Oh God, the pepper soup. Bathe me in the pepper soup. I’ll come back to that in a moment. Isibani, which opened last year down a tidy pedestrian cut-through beside the Bulgari Hotel, feels like a neighbourhood restaurant for a part of London that doesn’t have one. If you don’t count the masters of the universe living in the nearby chrome-clad apartment blocks protected from the world by layers of concierge, security and wealth-encrusted paranoia. Which I don’t. Still, there’s a profound warmth to this small, brightly lit dining room with its blue banquettes and marble floor and its waiters eager to help you navigate the unfamiliar. It’s simply a very nice place to be. The chef is Victor Okunowo, previously of the Wolseley and the Chiltern Firehouse, who also competed a couple of years back on MasterChef: the Professionals. He and his partners, Anthony Douglas Chuka and Abdul Malik Abubakar, describe the menu as a “love letter” to the West African food they grew up on. When it was first announced, the menu descriptions suggested they were determined to do some fancy, evolved version of West African classics; the sort of thing that might be perceived to bellow “Knightsbridge”. But praise be, there’s now far less of the evolution. It’s just the bangers. Which brings me to the main-course pepper soup, and the love letter I now wish to write to it. Oh my darling, come to me. Feed me. Make me whole. The name of the dish does the job. It really is a peppery pepper soup, the colour of the best brown foods, with an unrepentantly fiery hit. It grabs you by the collar, drags you in and shakes you about a bit. Laid across the bowl, as if happily beached, is a chargrilled croaker, a white-fleshed, meaty fish. That flesh tumbles from the bone and deep into the depths, so you can, well, fish it out again. It’s a profoundly comforting, utterly compelling bowl of savoury joy. I would come back here just for this, and not quite twitch at the £25 price tag. What were you expecting? That’s the bloody Bulgari Hotel over there. There are other very good things, too. Deep marinated, then grilled baby chicken yassa is sensitively cooked, with a lovely rich char, and comes with a forceful relish. There’s also a diverting jollof rice. In her brilliant cookbook Africana, the Nigerian-born food writer Lerato Umah-Shaylor writes vividly about the culture wars, especially between Nigeria and Ghana, over who makes the best jollof. Honestly, I’m not getting involved. It’s clear the base of tomatoes, onions and scotch bonnets are only the beginning. As Lerato says, it is a dish that demands practice. The very good jollof from Alhaji Suya in Peckham felt like a cosy domestic version; the kind of dish with which a parent welcomes home a child. The Isibani version is smokier and more aromatic. There is a great dessert dish of puff puff, those crisp-shelled, golden, deep-fried dough balls served with a sweet caramel sauce. Only it actually came with the starters. It is a cultural thing that those rooted to a savoury-sweet order of dishes can find hard to get their head around, even though that’s pretty arbitrary. I wanted to try the plantain tatin, but that was off. So instead, it was cheesecake and a very light sticky toffee pudding. I suspect you can get a lot of cheesecake and sticky toffee pudding in this corner of Knightsbridge. But they were great, so really I’m not complaining. Apart from about the suya. That, I am fussing over. Still, in the Knightsbridge of stupidly expensive wagyu burgers, and next-level sushi dressed with a psoriasis of caviar, and that ludicrous Salt Bae bloke across the road doing unpleasant things with cow and gold leaf, Isibani is a tiny joy. It feeds and it cares. I’ll take that. News bites Chef-restaurateur Terry Laybourne, a stalwart of the hospitality business in and around Newcastle and the northeast for decades, has reopened his Franco-Italian wine bar St Vincent after a three-year break. It closed with the first Covid lockdown in March of 2020 and while the rest of his businesses (and a new restaurant in York) began trading again, it stayed shuttered. The wine list will focus on small producers and will include a changing list of open bottles by the glass, alongside the now familiar menu of small and larger plates (stvincentnewcastle.co.uk). The spread of food halls across the UK continues with the announcement that the redevelopment of the former Queensgate Market building in Huddersfield, will include one. As well as a library and an event space, there will be room for ten independent traders around a communal seating area. Work will begin early next year, with completion by 2026. The Smoking Lobster group of seafood restaurants on the Isle of Wight, which already has outlets in Ventnor and Cowes as well as an events group, is to launch a new venture inside the recently renamed Foresters Hall hotel (formerly North House) in the heart of Cowes Old Town. The Brasserie by Smoking Lobster will open on 7 April and will have 80 covers plus a 15-seat private dining room.

Even if Miznon had pricked your attention, you might then think twice, because the menu – in green and red ink and comic sans font – is deeply confusing and, worse, dares to feature jokes. The temerity! There is no place on a modern British menu for anything resembling humour or personality. Oh no, sir. Here in Blighty we expect a loftily presented list of options with at most a short, snooze-some history of the owner, and giving nothing away of the 24/7 emotional-carnage bear pit with bread baskets that is “hospitality”. Then Miznon pitches up on Broadwick Street after a successful run in Tel Aviv, Paris, Vienna, Singapore, Melbourne and New York. It is noisy, staffed by what seems a cast of thousands, set in a charmingly unfussy room and offers high-quality, Tel Aviv-influenced street food. The menu feels like sleep deprivation, with in-jokes and a Benny Hill monologue fed into free translation software and shifted back and forth several times from Hebrew to French to English. Let us enjoy Miznon on the subject of pita: “Each of our pitas is getting her birthmark, and it is different from the other (it’s about recreation, not assembling), each of them is creating a precise address, and it is always you. Just the divine pleasure that is coming out of it is the same.” And what shall I have in this flatbread? Thick, juicy lamb kebab? Crystal shrimps with soured cream and “tomato’s ovaries”? How about falafel with Guinness “black blood”, a roasted cauliflower’s “inner parts” or the record scratch moment that is “cottage pie”. The trick here is to keep your nerve, set aside all British fears of wackiness and let the chaos envelop you, because the food is extraordinarily good. It is repeat-customer, “how are they doing this?”-level good . The, cough, “Deep Satisfaction” pita is stuffed with long-cooked, rich beef brisket shredded and mixed with melted cheddar and served with a crisp, pickled gherkin and pickled green chilli. This pita does exactly what it promises, rather salaciously, on the menu. Do not order this to share, though. It is a meaty, cheesy, slobbering beast that will erupt down your shirt. This is food for snaffling away by oneself. Miznon’s “run-over” potato, meanwhile, has dogged my dreams for weeks. The spud is baked until its skin is the zenith of oily, salty crispness, then heaped with obscene amounts of butter and cream, before being placed between two sheets of greaseproof paper and squashed flat, leaving a sticky, creamy carpet of fluffy mash and shredded jacket, which you then unwrap. Actual carbohydrate heaven. At this point in my Miznon journey, it dawned on me that this isn’t a forgettable, shabby-chic spin on “street food”, but instead something engineered for greatness. Shani’s take on delicious, on-the-hop sustenance is brimful of largesse, heat, salt, cream and grease. A glorious puddle of oily, silky hummus is topped with soft chickpeas and tomato, and comes with spongy bread for mopping; if you like, you can have lamb ragu as an extra topping. A whole head of cauliflower, charred at the edges and stuffed with melted butter, is no longer one of my five a day, because such decadence robs it of any health value, but, hey. Miznon is the sort of place where you should treat your first visit as a trial run. Accept help from the servers, and let them take the strain of ordering. They are delightful, upbeat and sympathetic when you see “whole roasted broccoli tree dripping on your shoes” and mystery sides such as “golden meat” on the menu. Having fully caught Miznon’s gist, I will return to try the spaghetti bolognese pitta, possibly with a side of roast beetroot carpaccio and horseradish. Or perhaps the “Intimate” pita, which is a Tel Aviv spin on beef stew with root veg. The “all-day English breakfast” pita with chopped minute steak, lima beans and spicy tomato sauce will drive full-English purists half daft, but then nothing about Miznon is wholly serious or gives a stuff about rules; all they care about is that you bumble back out of the door wholly sated and with your top trouser button loosened. Pudding was a huge portion of wobbly, very sweet malabi – a sort of Middle Eastern panna cotta – drowning in rosehip syrup. The only other sweet option is “sugar glazed banana steaks with dolce [sic] de leche, whipping cream and broken butter cookies”. I’m bringing the Dent clan here over Christmas, when I’m tired of recycling turkey. As restaurant recommendations go, that is really as good as it gets.

Have you tried its vegan fake egg, no-duck donburi? The one with the replica egg made of coconut milk and sriracha mayonnaise? Is the mere mention of this “egg” causing a vein in your neck to throb? Like Piers Morgan’s incandescence at Greggs’ vegan sausage roll, which was devoid of pig cruelty, but still harming him? If you’re trying Veganuary for the first time this year, you’ve come at an interesting time. British hospitality’s approach to vegetarians and vegans has pivoted 180 degrees since the bad old days of the pub-grub microwaved veggie lasagne made with a sachet of Batchelors Beanfeast that tasted like yeasty gravel. The change has been seismic: meat-free diets are these days catered for everywhere I go, from fine dining and fancy to KFC’s vegan Quorn patty “coated in their 11 famous herbs and spices”. One of 2022’s best openings was Chantelle Nicholson’s Apricity, which features a vegetable-heavy menu where tempura kraut with cashew cheese, Knepp radish salad and jalapeños sits beside Brambletye celeriac with chestnuts and fava beans. This is a long way from the days when my father, back in the mid-1980s, apologised for my teenage vegetarian presence in the doorway of every cafe or pub dining room we walked into. “Table for three,” he’d say. “And this one who won’t eat meat. I know! Bloody silly idea from some pop star.” (He meant Morrissey, who is to blame for most things.) Serving staff would gather around, forlorn, wonder if scampi was strictly an animal, then offer potato wedges with lettuce. I added meat back into my diet in the 1990s, but I am perfectly happy living mainly on things that didn’t once have a face or a family, so this new wave of dining is welcome. What changed, I think, is that restaurants saw there is money in them there tofu-eaters. Not just among the Guardian-reading wokerati, but in those who avoid dairy due to dietary issues, or pork for religious belief, or beef over concerns about CO2 levels. And all this means that, at Wagamama, your server will now ask, “Do you need the vegan menu?”, before proffering a list of yasai gyoza, bang bang cauliflower, sticky vegan ribs, panko aubergine bao and, of course, that aforementioned egg dish, which right now is possibly making some readers really very angry. Because, if vegans don’t want to eat egg, why are they buying a replica one? And if they love chickens so much, why are they making their clucky friends surplus to earthly needs? And what if a real egg-eater got all confused by the term “vegan egg” and bought the wrong type? Surely the egg industry must copyright the word “egg”, prosecute all pretenders and lock them up on an artichoke-only diet. All of these sane comments – not to mention the rest – are typical whenever I write that I love the buffalo glaze burger at Temple of Seitan or Kinda.co’s farmhouse “cheese”. In fact, sometimes it feels that hospitality’s move to make every diner happy actually made no one truly content. Because, now, health experts wince at veganism’s ultra-processed fake meat, nut milks filled with seed oils and reliance on powdered pea protein, or claims that leaky gut, eczema or depression can be cured with riced cauliflower and turmeric. Meanwhile, “true” vegans despise half-hearted flexitarians for “appropriating their belief system” down at Hungry Horse by eating the cinnamonkey bread while still torturing bees by eating their honey. Furthermore, as smallhold British farmers are bombarded with Alan Partridge-style abuse – “You make pigs smoke, you feed beef burgers to swans” – there was a reported uptick in carnivore diets in 2022. This led to global TikTok sensation The Liver King ramming kilos of raw cow spleen into his face while claiming he’d bio-hacked his way to life eternal. So forgive me for shying away from further discussions on that fake egg, because things in vegan land can get a little testy, even if the seitan duck in cherry sauce is yummy. Still, I can enjoy the pleasures that the vegan revolution offers, such as at The Lingholm Kitchen in the Lake District the other day, where the meaty menu of croque monsieur with glazed ham, stuffed turkey breast and 12-hour pulled beef hash also features a very good vegetable pakora wrap stuffed with hummus, mango chutney and spinach; there’s also a roast squash and chestnut pastry parcel with cranberry gravy. Even the caterers at my father’s funeral in Carlisle at Christmas offered vegetarian afternoon tea with finger sandwiches, soup and cakes to suit all whims, needs and fancies. I could hear his voice as I put in the order: “Do you have anything for my daughter? This one says she doesn’t like meat!”','https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/06/my-father-thought-not-eating-meat-was-silly-but-the-vegan-revolution-has-been-seismic','Grace Dent','My father thought not eating meat was silly but the vegan revolution has been seismic | Grace Dent on restaurants',-2.45438910000000021,54.2776946999999907,0.57889999999999997);

Total Trust menu (Sunday/Monday) £25, Explore menu (Thursday-Saturday) £40, wines from £23 There’s one thing guaranteed to make a great restaurant experience even better: a great story. Glasgow’s 111 by Modou has a terrific story. When rabid right-wingers, sodden with rhetoric, are attempting to cast all immigrants as feckless spongers, it’s one that needs to be told. Senegalese-born Modou Diagne spent much of his childhood in Spain. When he was 18, he came alone to Glasgow in search of something better. He had just £200 and at first slept rough. Eventually he found sanctuary in a church and then got into a hostel. In 2014, after a year of applications, he landed a job as a kitchen porter at 111 by Nico in Kelvinside. The restaurant is part of the Six by Nico group, owned by chef Nico Simeone. They offer good-value tasting menus that change every six weeks, from sites across Scotland, England and now Ireland. Simeone quickly clocked Diagne’s work ethic. He progressed him through roles in the kitchen at speed, so that by 2018 he was head chef of 111 by Nico. In March 2020, Simeone summoned Diagne and told him he was changing the restaurant’s name to 111 by Modou. The place was his now. And if you want a good old cry, go to the restaurant’s website and watch the video of that moment. Obviously, the pandemic intervened, during which Diagne cooked in a local church for vulnerable people in his community. Finally, in April 2021, his restaurant reopened. From Thursday to Saturday, they offer a five-course tasting menu at £40 a head. You choose a main ingredient at each course, list any allergies or major dislikes, and they do the rest. On Sundays and Mondays, however, they run the Total Trust menu. Again, you explain any allergies and dislikes. Then it just happens: five courses of extremely good, inventive cooking for a ludicrous £25 a head. You can have a £30 wine flight, or choose a bottle from the short wine list that starts at £23 and finishes at about £35. The Total Trust menu changes with each service depending on what’s available, which means the dishes pictured with this review will be different to those described in it. You’ll just have to trust me, as I did them. If you’re a picky eater with the palate of an overindulged toddler, this is not for you. My companion only specified no cheese on their dishes. If you fancy, they will tell you exactly what you’re being served as each plate arrives, but there’s also a card on the table inviting you to “challenge your foodie senses and write what you can taste in each course”. Almost 30 years ago I went to a restaurant in London by the name of Aubergine where an obscure chef called Gordon Ramsay – whatever happened to him? – served a trio of crème brûlées, each flavoured with a different herb. The oleaginous maître d’ insisted we guess the flavour with an “aren’t we clever” smirk and a refusal to be drawn. It was bloody annoying. At those prices I only wanted lunch, not a parlour game. This is wildly different. Our waiter is terrific at what becomes a shared venture, not an us-versus-them competition. When I tell him that the breadcrumbed and deep-fried meaty disc with dark dollops of sauce, served as an opening snack, is an oxtail croquette, probably with black garlic, he looks thrilled. Clever me. So, settle back into this gunmetal-grey velvet booth, put your elbows on the polished copper table and enjoy the ride. The cooking is rich and layered and big on frothy, beautifully executed mousse-like emulsions which some might disparagingly call foams, as if it were proof that this whole restaurant lark is a racket. It isn’t, if it’s done well. My first dish is a heap of warm cheesy mousse, the colour of the best cheddar, dribbled with the brilliant green of chive oil and topped with the crunch of deep-fried crispy onions. It’s all the flavours of the very best packet of cheese and onion crisps in spoonable form. My companion gets a version made with a mousse of roasted squash. That’s followed by a fat, silky raviolo of poached salmon. It looks like a creamy fedora as made by the White Company, and comes lubricated by a bowling lawn-green dill emulsion. Next come fillets of poached sole that have been rolled and sliced into a fat cylinder, their alabaster surface gently torched. There’s a frothy seafood bisque and, tucked underneath, lightly pickled mussels. It’s boosted by a layer of taramasalata, a soothing cauliflower purée and, for a little further acidity, diced pickled cucumber. Listed like this, it sounds complicated. It’s not. The sole is the star. The rest are merely supporting actors. These days I take truly awful photographs of what I’ve eaten, partly to jog my addled memory and partly so I can post those dismal pictures to Instagram each Sunday, so that people there can be utterly appalled by my images. It’s only when I’ve cleared every last smudge of the meat course down to the glaze, that I realise I forgot to thumb my phone into life. What can I say? It was just too damn alluring: a layered piece of braised lamb belly, sliced through and then seared, with just the right amount of hot melting fat, a thick meaty jus and a parsnip purée. That’s all there is. And then it’s gone. Dessert is a lipstick-pink strawberry sorbet with a lime and white chocolate mousse. Underneath is a layer of torched Italian meringue. On top are fragments of Swiss meringue. Did I work out what most of the things on each plate were without prompting? Well, yes, I did, but not because I’m a flavour ninja. It’s because they prepared each ingredient so it shouted its name. I was left with the sense of a kitchen which, having set a narrow frame for itself – just those five dishes – was having fun, but which had not lost sight of the importance of us having fun, too. I’ve rolled my eyes recently at the viral spread of tasting menus. But five courses like this, offered at such a delightful price, simply can’t outstay its welcome. Throw in the delicious story of Modou Diagne, who worked his damnedest to get to where he is, and you have a banging recipe for a great restaurant. I put my total trust in him and his team. I would happily do so again. News bites The replacement for the Tom Kerridge-run restaurant at Manchester’s Stock Exchange Hotel, co-owned by ex-footballers Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs, has now opened. The head chef at the Stock Market Grill is Joshua Reed Cooper, who has worked at Stockport’s Where the Light Gets In and at Manchester’s Mana. The opening menu includes a hand-raised pork pie with English mustard, a suet pudding of confit rabbit and a rib-eye steak from ex-dairy Friesians. Finish with profiteroles or a whisky baba (stockmarketgrill.com). Lee Westcott, formerly of the Typing Room in London and Pensons in Tenbury Wells, has been named as the head chef of the two restaurants in the second Birch hotel, opening in South Croydon next month. Elodie will serve a five-course seasonal tasting menu, which will include ingredients foraged from the hotel’s ground. There will also be a more informal restaurant called Vervain (birchcommunity.com). And in Braemar, Adam Maddock has been appointed head chef of the camp fantasy of tartan, rutting stags and rare back-lit whiskies at £800 a dram, that is the Fife Arms. Previously, Maddock worked with Michael Caines at Gidleigh Park and at Whatley Manor. The hotel is part of the Artfarm portfolio, owned by the people behind the Hauser &amp; Wirth art gallery company, which also has the Audley pub and the Groucho Club in London (thefifearms.com).

Starters £8.50-£16.50, mains £17.50-£48, desserts £6.50-£9, wines from £25.50 There are film critics who, presented with a Martin Scorsese movie, can be guaranteed to rave. There are theatre critics who will be bucket-full of puppyish love when writing about any musical by Stephen Sondheim. This is the restaurant review equivalent. The only argument for me not reviewing the newly opened Bouchon Racine is that I am a huge, dribbling admirer of all the people involved and all the food they serve. In other words, because I was stone cold certain in advance that the restaurant would be very good indeed and because I was proved absolutely right, I shouldn’t say so as I have already shown myself to be compromised, courtesy of my deep experience and overwhelming, impeccable good taste. Yeah, right. So here it is: Bouchon Racine is everything. It is the joyful rebirth of chef Henry Harris’s restaurant Racine, a once greatly adored bistro on London’s Brompton Road, which opened in 2002. Harris, who was part of Simon Hopkinson’s first brigade at Bibendum, wanted, after a less happy journey around kitchens in thrall to fashion, to open a restaurant serving the kind of classic French dishes he loved. He wanted to do indecently good things with butter and cream and the inner bits of the animal from which too many people recoil. His menu there was an unashamed celebration of the bourgeois, marinated in the very best of Bordeaux, fair doused in Armagnac. Racine, which means root, was meant to be a neighbourhood restaurant, but by 2015 there was not much of a neighbourhood left. Too many people had treated property less as a home than an investment. Harris moved on. He brought a little of his Francophile magic to a bunch of pubs and, along the way, for the sake of full disclosure, cooked the last supper for the end of my book of that name, in a room above one of them. We ate very well that night. Now he has teamed up with Dave Strauss, another industry veteran, with a gift for service and a beard that Zeus himself must envy. I have many reasons to adore Strauss, beyond the fact that he makes good service look effortless. He was general manager of the hilarious Beast in 2014 when I wrote an excoriating review. I argued that the steaks were so expensive, “they should lead the damn animal into the restaurant and install it under the table so it can pleasure me while I eat.” Strauss responded on Twitter: “Fellating cows already en route to restaurant.” He ran Goodman and Zelman Meats before a stint in the West Country with the chef Mitch Tonks. Together, Harris and Strauss have now taken over the Three Compasses opposite London’s Farringdon station. Downstairs is the pub where they sell pints of Moretti. Upstairs is the dining room, with its glass-ceilinged conservatory area at the front. It used to be a Thai place. The red carpet has been replaced by dark varnished floorboards. The walls are the deepest shade of Jersey cream, and the menu is a scribbled blackboard of true loveliness, which changes depending on what’s available. Start with oysters from Carlingford or silken slices of nutty jambon noir de Bigorre from the Hautes-Pyrénées, with fat the colour of antique crockery. Drape that across chunks of baguette smeared with the best funky salted butter. Hold a bit of the bread back to swish through the hot brown butter with salty-sour capers bathing two lobes of calves’ brains, impeccably cooked so that the outside is crisp and the inside pearly white. Too rich for your blood? Too cerebral? Have the chicken liver pâté, coarse cut and earthy and reminiscent of the Jewish way with chopped livers. Or have dense, tensed pieces of herring with potato salad dressed with slivers of carrot and ribbons of acidulated onion and the best peppery olive oil. Swoon a little. Take a sip of your well-priced Côtes du Rhône. Centre yourself for what is to come. There are few places in the country that serve tête de veau, probably because there are few people who like the sound of it. But then if you’re going to bang an animal on the head, you should be prepared to eat all of it, including that head, boned and rolled and poached, until it becomes a deliciously wobbly arrangement of meat and jelly in a lip-smacking, limpid broth with turned new potatoes and a sprightly sauce ravigote full of vinaigrette zip and fresh herbs. Not for you? OK, have a Harris old-stager like the grilled leg of rabbit in a mustard sauce full of the nose punch of Dijon, with a plank of crisped bacon balanced on top. Or just have the côte de boeuf with frothy béarnaise. Chips are hardly optional. What’s that you say? Non-meat eaters? Hang on. I’ll just check. Well, this evening there is a main course of orzo with wild mushrooms. But honestly, that’s not high on the agenda at Racine. Be livid, by all means. Send me furious emails or better still send the furious emails to your like-minded friends. You’ll enjoy that. And then perhaps, go somewhere else to eat. Meanwhile, we’re into dessert: a beautiful piece of pastrywork in the shape of a tarte vaudoise à la crème, the crisp case filled with best sweetened dairy. There’s a magnificent crème caramel with an Armagnac-steeped Agen prune on the side for those who want them. Best of all, because I am biased and also right, there’s a Mont Blanc gâteau for two, the huge raft of crisp and chewy meringue layered with whipped cream and noodles of boozy chestnut purée. Start with a glass of white wine boosted by a blush of Campari, aka a Bicyclette; finish with a small measure of something potent from one of those fancy-looking bottles over there. In between, order a reasonably priced wine which comes from the same place that gifted Harris all the recipes. I love the raucous variety of restaurants available today. I still quiver with excitement at being introduced to a culinary tradition I do not know. But there is a part of me deeply betrothed to the older things, done as well as they can be done. Bouchon Racine is all of that. If you feel my prior knowledge of this restaurant invalidates my opinion, fair enough. There will be another review along next week. Meanwhile, I’ll be the happy man with the ludicrous Mont Blanc and the spoon. News bites The hospitality group D&amp;D London, formerly Conran Restaurants, has announced a slew of closures. They include Klosterhaus in Bristol and East 59th in Leeds. London loses two of its most venerable names. The Blueprint Café first opened in 1994 and was presided over by chef Jeremy Lee for nearly 20 years before he moved to Quo Vadis in 2012. Avenue was opened on St James’s Street by restaurateur Chris Bodker in December 1995, as a sibling to Kensington Place. If, despite that gloomy news, you still fancy getting into the restaurant business, look no further: Julie’s, a celebrated celeb magnet in London’s Holland Park these past 53 years, is up for sale, as the owners Timothy and Cathy Herring move in to retirement. The likes of Mick Jagger, Tina Turner and Paul McCartney all ate there over the years. Famously, the most prized table was set back in its own curtained alcove and, being numbered G3, was nicknamed the G-Spot. Well of course it was. Glasgow is to get a new Italian restaurant headed up by three chef brothers who previously worked for Francesco Mazzei at London’s Sartoria. Antonio, Pasquale and Simone Cozzolino will open Banca di Roma inside the city’s Royal Exchange building in the next few months. Their menu will be inspired by their upbringing on their family’s tomato farm in Vesuvio, Naples. Desserts will include a gold bar in tribute to the banking history of the building. Follow their progress on Instagram @bancadiromauk. • This article was amended on 16 January 2023 because an earlier version misnamed Julie’s restaurant as “Jules”.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(20,'2023-03-05T06:00:46Z','10 Tib Lane, Manchester: ‘There’s a lot to be stimulated by’ – restaurant review','10 Tib Lane, Manchester M2 4JB (0161 833 1034). Small and large plates £8-£20, desserts £7, wines from £24 All restaurant locations have history. The tall, narrow building at 10 Tib Lane, just back from Manchester’s Princess Street, is no exception. Tonight, chef Robert Owen Brown is the keeper of the memories. “I lugged flagstones up there,” he says, pointing at the stairs to the floor above. He waves a hand airily towards the far end of this dimly lit first-floor dining room. “That was a mirrored door made of smoked glass with a big brass cock for a handle.” Back then the place was called Lounge 10, which sounds like the death throes of a terrible movie franchise that peaked at Lounge 3. Owen Brown was the opening chef and clearly, before launch, assistant builder. The Roman orgy murals were decidedly not safe for work, and at weekends the management installed a clairvoyant in the bogs. “We did a truffle pizza,” says Owen Brown. “And a smoked fillet of beef with quail eggs. Rather good all of that, actually.” A dozen years on and we live in times which are, depending on your point of view, either drearily puritanical or simply more considerate. Today, at the eponymous 10 Tib Lane, a door knob is not something at which you point and snigger. It merely opens doors. The floors are dark varnished boards, the walls are distressed brick on one side and white tile on the other. The website boasts a declaration of intent, written by the trio of Manchester hospitality veterans behind the business: “Classic cocktails, natural wine that doesn’t scare you off, beer that matters and seasonal food with the best produce we can get our hands on.” Fair enough. We should put this one alongside places like Erst in Ancoats, the recently reviewed Climat, the soon to open Higher Ground, the Alan and Another Hand. All offer eclectic small plates and a knowingly idiosyncratic drinks list. Somewhere along the way Manchester was culinarily twinned with Hackney. Although of course, a declaration of intent is worthless if the cooking doesn’t pop and slap. Tonight, we are mob-handed. There are six of us at the table and nine dishes, so let’s find out. Yes please, we’ll have all of them, and a few twice over. Modern trends have been attended to: there are menu mentions of cured egg yolk, charred hispi cabbage and sourdough toast. But there’s also a wonderful old-school sensibility at work. It’s displayed in a series of sauces and dressings which are coat-the-back-of-a-spoon thick, and built around huge sweet and sour flavours. Sweetbreads are breaded and deep-fried, like chicken nuggets for grownups, but come on a thick, emulsified grain mustard sauce full of seeds that pop pleasingly against the top of your mouth. That blackened slab of cabbage is partnered with a sauce that digs deep into the sweet, sugary tones of slowly roasted shallots. A big old pork chop is seared so the ribbon of fat is properly crisp, and the handle of bone is eminently nibbleable. It’s dressed with a gravy which makes a grand virtue of the sticky gelatine joys in a deep chicken jus the colour of oak varnish. Behold the celeriac purée on the side, made by someone who seemingly spent some part of their career in a big, fancy kitchen being barked at to pass their purées through a chinois time and again, until they were soft and silky enough to smooth out WH Auden’s face. An impeccably made smoked trout mousse is the salmon pink of a posh 1970s napkin and tablecloth set. It’s saved from being the sort of thing that would have been passed around with the melba toast at one of Margo Leadbetter’s soirées in Surbiton by the modish addition of salmon roe, glinting rose in the candlelight. And then there is the truly spectacular, supple and subtle cooking of a boned plaice meunière, the pearly flesh holding together, with caper butter and nutty brown shrimps and all-round coastal loveliness. That last word may not describe flavour; it does communicate the surge of glowing emotion engendered by one well-cooked fish. It’s enough to moisten the eye of a classically trained chef like Owen Brown, further down the table. There are a couple of flourishes. A version of Fergus Henderson’s hot, wobbly roasted bone marrow with salty, vinegary parsley salad, is served not with the usual thick wedges of sourdough toast. It comes, instead, with golden blocks of what they call pommes Anna, but which are closer to the currently very popular, and always welcome, deep-fried confit potatoes. It may not be quite enough potato for the job. Save a bit of the toasted sourdough which comes with the steak tartare, served in a big heap and topped with a scribble of what they call an egg yolk purée. Given that yolk is already a liquid, I don’t quite understand the purée thing. But it does soften the mustardy pile of chopped beef. Partner it with the salad of brightly dressed bitter leaves with chewy strands of roasted oyster mushroom. Complete the nine-dish menu with a sustaining plateful of red wine-braised lentils, looking like black gravel in the low-lit room, with deep chewy roasted jerusalem artichokes. Half the dessert list is made up of either British cheeses or a glass of Christmassy Pedro Ximénez sherry, but those are both merely examples of tasteful shopping. Far more beguiling is a deep-filled, shuddering caramel tart, the crisp pastry cut to a fine arrowhead of a point, the golden custard surface sprinkled with a little bright white sea salt. Or there’s a rectangle of deep-fried bread and butter pudding, crusted with sugar, its centre warm and custardy, with a scoop of brandy cream on the side. Do you want some of that? Well of course you do. No dish breaks £20 and most are only just over £10. The wine list is short. There is, of course, that scary talk of low-intervention wines which, as one friend at the table says, may be delightful when drunk at the winery, but taste only of death and unhappiness elsewhere. Happily, we find our way to a couple of conventional bottles: a zesty, lemony white from Savoie by Jean Perrier and a soft, round St Emilion by Château Marchand. The filthy murals may have been chipped away but amid the guttering candles and old-school sauciness, there’s now an awful lot to be stimulated by at 10 Tib Lane. News bites Cardiff-based chef Lee Skeet, who has made a name for himself in the city with the tiny tasting menu restaurant Cora, has opened an oyster bar. It’s called Jackson’s, and occupies the ground floor of a building in Duke Street Arcade near Cardiff Castle. In a few weeks’ time he will also move Cora, which seats just 10, into the floor above. Both venues are named after Skeet’s children and were in part made possible by a £26,000 crowdfunding campaign. At coracardiff.com. The self-styled Prince of Birmingham, Glynn Purnell, has opened a tapas bar close by his flagship restaurant Purnell’s in the city centre. Plates by Purnell’s has just 28 covers, and a menu that draws upon the chef’s time cooking in northern Spain. Dishes include classics like chorizo in red wine and prawns in garlic, alongside aubergine chips with truffle, a chickpea cassoulet and a grilled baby gem salad. It’s open Wednesday to Saturday from noon. Visit platesbypurnells.com. And finally, congratulations to Liam Rogers, formerly of Restaurant Sat Bains and Restaurant Andrew Fairlie at Gleneagles, who has been appointed head chef at Northcote in Lancashire, under executive chef Lisa Goodwin-Allen.

Snacks £4-£7.50, larger plates £7.50-£24, sharing plates £30-£70, desserts £5.50-£8.50, wines from £29 No one will ever write romantic poetry about the entrance to Climat in Manchester. Words like “blunt” and “austere” are never likely to make hearts tremble. As if Climat should care. Only restaurants dependent on passing trade need worry about their lip-glossed looks, and right now nobody is coming here accidentally. Climat, open for only three weeks the night I visit, is every kind of hot. Manchester is a big bustling city, but faced by a new venture that everyone agrees is doing all the good things in all the right ways, it behaves like the sweetest kind of village. The good news passes swiftly from digital ear to digital ear. So tread down the hallway of this office block, located in a shadowed street some way behind Deansgate. Take the lift up eight floors to the purpose-built rooftop dining room, with its outside terrace for the summer months, and see for yourself. The long, sharp-edged space houses an equally long open kitchen fringed by a counter. Tonight, all the counter seats are taken, as are the tables, and there is a pleasing whiff of smoke on the air from the grill at the far end. A glass wall looks out over the skyline. The view recalls the touching illustrations from Maurice Sendak’s In the Night Kitchen, the outcrops of Victorian grandeur sitting shoulder to shoulder with the shinier modern blocks and their golden-lit squares of window, silhouetted against the ink-black sky. Now look down at the menu, and clock that you’ve come to the right place. Chef Luke Richardson, who has time with Gary Usher’s bistros on his CV, describes it as “Parisian expat food”, which perhaps makes most sense to those who have worked there. They also describe it, more helpfully, as “food you want to eat”. That’s better. It’s hard not to fall in adult love with a list that kicks off with hash browns topped with whorls of taramasalata, and a vol-au-vent filled with lamb keema. The name Climat references consciously the importance of weather to the nurturing of great wines and perhaps, unconsciously its importance to nurturing the stoic character of great Mancunians. It’s the second venture from Christopher Laidler, owner of the small wine bar Covino in Chester. Accordingly, wine is a major part of the deal. There’s a strong one-page list available by the glass and carafe, as well as a bigger document full of Burgundy’s finest at reasonable prices. Order a bottle from the Chablis list and they may bring it to you a few degrees above chilled, as is the fashion. Don’t be afraid to insist it be introduced to an ice bucket. As our waiter says, “It’s your wine.” It is indeed. Now we need something to eat. Start with chewy slices of their focaccia bathing in ponds of the best olive oil. Follow that with the vol-au-vent, a 70s classic which has grown up and learned a few things about the world. The puff pastry here is golden and deeply enriched, like a puffy brioche, and stuffed with spiced minced lamb, topped with pickled fresh chillies and deep-fried curry leaves. Fight over the last lamb-fat-glazed crumbs. Follow that with a golden block of their hash browns, the crisp, textured exterior giving way to a maternal softness, with a back note of dill. Use it as a vehicle for their creamy take on tarama. The dishes get bigger as you work your way down. A whole aubergine has been roasted until it has surrendered and slumped, the smoky skin bursting to reveal the pale flesh. It is dressed with a mix of tahini, buttermilk and handfuls of toasted pine nuts, topped in turn with a tangle of shredded radicchio to bring a bitter note to the proceedings. They like grown-up touches of bitterness at Climat. It’s there in a purée of lime pickle, which clings to the edge of a plate of spiced gurnard; a thick piece from the tail end that has been skin down on the grill until it is blackened. There are ribbons of pickled cucumber, folded over each other as if part of a dressmaker’s set, and a deep puddle of a rich, enfolding gravy they simply call “curry sauce”, littered with more fried curry leaves. Not everything works. A risotto is so desperately sludgy, I find myself wondering whether it came from the same kitchen. There is at least a toffeed chewiness to the roasted Jerusalem artichokes with which it is topped. Push it to one side, because here comes something from the short list of grills to be shared, priced from £30 for the Tamworth pork chop with smoked beets to £70 for a Dexter sirloin. We have the duck at £55. It’s the whole crown. Both breasts have been slowly cooked over the coals until the meat is still a reassuring shade of pink with the skin the colour of amber, then taken off the bone. It comes with a light jus spritzed with clementines and a little more radicchio. It’s a witty take on duck à l’orange, which should indeed have those bitter notes. What’s striking about the menu, which changes by the day, is its depth. There is so much more here to try. I very much like the sound of the braised carrots with whipped feta and hazelnut pesto, or the hake with barbecued leek, or the brill with seaweed hollandaise. Dessert is not just churned creamy things. There is a deep-filled frangipane tart layered with tart plums, with a snowy peak of crème fraîche on the side. There is a choux bun, as pert and golden as the vol-au-vent at the start, filled with a nutmeg ice-cream, dark chocolate ganache and cherries. The bill for all this is not small, but it feels justified. Plus, you can just come and sit at the counter, have a couple of plates and a good glass of wine, admire the view and leave with a less than ravaged bank account. Christopher Laidler is here tonight, watching his team attend with grace to a happy room. He looks a little startled. This is a massive undertaking compared to the tiny mothership in Chester, he tells me. It is indeed a massive undertaking, but one which is also a raging success. Many in Manchester seem delighted by the arrival of a terrific restaurant serving food you really want to eat. Just don’t be put off by the front door. News bites Elsewhere in Manchester much-admired chef Mary-Ellen McTague, a driving force behind the city’s poverty food group Eat Well MCR, is taking on a new role. She will be heading up the offering at the new Treehouse Hotel, Manchester, when it opens this Spring.

We’re talking a century ago at least, because this historic coaching inn is very, very old, which means everyone who knows whether or not my great, great, great grandmother pulled pints here is long gone, including my mother, who held all the keys to family folklore. How I wish I’d made copious notes on this stuff years ago, when instead I was gallivanting down in that fancy London, eating mackerel in seawater cream at Claridge’s or some other truly vital pursuit. Meanwhile, in about 2017, in the historically termed “debatable land” between the Solway Firth and Dumfries and Galloway, Pentonbridge Inn began to go through a vast and costly refurbishment. It transformed from a largely ignored, ramshackle fortress against the elements into a rather beautiful, bold, pale building in which are now served chef Chris Archer’s five- or eight-course tasting menus. To someone such as myself, who knows the area, the venture is intriguing. It takes pig-headed determination to sell egg-yolk ravioli with truffle beurre noisette in a spot where the road network is patchy at best and the last train stopped in 1969. Also, retaining staff from September to May might be a major issue, because up here those are the Withnail and I months in which daylight is scarce and the sleet falls mainly sideways. Despite this, or perhaps in defiance of it, Pentonbridge Inn is thriving. In fact, they make it look so easy, you might well leave thinking: “Hospitality crisis? What hospitality crisis?” It is sleek and modern, with interiors that verge on the Scandi. Do not go expecting chintz, tartan or olde worlde Cumberland. The team is mainly local, with restaurant manager Ross Bell leading a warm, knowledgeable service without any airs and graces. These are the kind of staff who need to be retained at all costs. At Saturday dinner, they serve eight courses, using predominantly local ingredients, including fruit, veg and herbs from the nearby walled garden at Netherby Hall. Archer has worked at Midsummer House in Cambridge and The Cottage in the Wood near Keswick, which is evident in his culinary finesse, but it seems to me that at Pentonbridge Inn he has found his true stride. This is a menu of extraordinary confidence: sometimes playful, sometimes dead serious, and always executed with precision. An opening course of “cheddar, onion, ale” is a rich, fragrant broth with a plate of cheesy, sunshine-yellow “custard creams”. It merges seamlessly into fresh warm bread with rich potted beef sealed with a thick, white layer of beef dripping. Dripping isn’t a thing you see often on menus, not least because modern audiences find the word offputting, which is perhaps why it isn’t listed on the menu. Any sense of the informal is quashed, however, by the next plate of delicately poached chalk stream trout. It is arranged in cylindrical plinths around neat curls of pickled garden carrot, abstemious blobs of rich curry sauce and a puddle of orange essence; every fragment of hazelnut dotted around the plate feels as if it has been tweezered into place with intent by the wordless chefs in the open kitchen. The next two dishes are plated with similar aplomb: a chunk of perfectly fried North Sea cod loin with a fat, unshelled langoustine draped over the top, poached celeriac, a single perfect rectangle of puffed potato and sweet cider sauce. This is the sort of food that makes me giddy with questions: who, exactly, is this man? Why are more people not extolling his genius? Where are the Pentonbridge Inn’s Michelin stars (it’s worth at least two)? How many times do they puff the potato to get the 30 identical rectangles, before sprinkling them with algae-coloured dust and arranging them on cod without said dust sullying the sauce or the langoustine? In recent times especially, it has felt wrong to glorify expensive, unabashedly poncy food, but cooking at this level is something Britain should be proud of. Not just here in Cumbria, but right across the United Kingdom, where hospitality kings and queens strive daily to honour fine indigenous produce and plate it like conceptual art while still somehow keeping the lights on and the hot water running. The Pentonbridge Inn does all these things and more, while serving local fallow deer with haggis and sweet-and-sour quince. Next, three desserts, each lovelier than the last. First, a frothy pre-dessert of whipped sour cream on Guinness and a lush, blackcurrant coulis, then poached pineapple with fresh gingerbread and a caramel parfait, and finally, my favourite, petits fours of warm, chunky, sticky canelés. Of all the French patisserie to lose your waistline over, canelés are the most under-rated. Yes, the bichon au citron and the paris-brest will always charm me, but the canelé, in all its dumpy, rum-fuelled, custard-centred, crunchy-coated majesty, rules my heart. No restaurant truly needs to make fresh canelés as its petits fours without even mentioning them on the menu, but this is one that under-promises and over-delivers. If this is the new era of the Pentonbridge Inn, it’s safe for another century. Pentonbridge Inn, Penton, Carlisle, Cumbria, 01228 586636. Open lunch Fri-Sat, noon-1.30pm (last orders), dinner Wed-Sat, 6-8.30pm (last orders). Set menus only, five-course lunch £75, eight-course dinner £95, both plus drinks and service.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(23,'2023-02-05T06:00:14Z','The Sportsman Club, West Bromwich: ‘You’ve won at lunch’ – restaurant review','The Sportsman Club, 13 High Street, West Bromwich B70 6PP (0121 553 1353). Starters £3-£10.50, mains £4.50-£10.50, desserts £2, beers from £3.80 Some people have too much time on their hands. One of them is a reader I’ll call Ian, because that’s his bloody name. Early in 2022 he sent me an ominous email explaining that he would be keeping a close eye on how many of my reviews were outside London in the coming year. On the second working day of 2023, he delivered on that delightful promise. He sent me an Excel spreadsheet of all my 2022 reviews. Just picture Ian, every Sunday morning, tongue gripped between teeth, making another entry, perhaps grinning with vindication over that review from Shoreditch, or slightly disappointed that I’d been to Swansea or Preston. Happily, for Ian, it all came good. Apparently only 52% of my reviews were outside London. Fair to say, Ian was very, almost performatively, disappointed in me. My wife was outraged. “Does this man [she used another word] know how much bloody time you spend on trains?” No, I suspect Ian doesn’t and nor, I imagine, does he care. In a perfect world, reviews would be geographically spread according to population. This is not a perfect world. For all that things have greatly improved, the spread of restaurants worth writing about isn’t perfectly spread either. Once you subtract the nice but dull pubs serving menus of rib-eye steaks and lemon tart, the garden centre cafés offering “lite bites” and the intense bearded chaps doing nine-course tasting menus from reconditioned barns, celebrating nature’s bounty – please, don’t make me – there are still stretches of the UK with precious little to write home about, figuratively and, given my job, literally. Add in the fact that these days, many don’t open until Thursday evening, that I have an unpredictable thing called a “family life” and recently, that other thing called rail strikes, which are equally so, it can be complicated. I might point out that a review in, say, Aberdeen, while diverting for Aberdonians, may be less useful to a reader in, say, Stoke, than one in London because they are less likely to go to Aberdeen than they are to London. But that would just make Ian roll his eyes so forcibly, you could hear the balls scraping against the sockets from here. As the great Groucho Marx never said, these are my excuses. If you don’t like them, I have others. Anyway, I continue to travel, forever in the hope of finding the interesting and the good stuff. Which is why I have put my faith in this Avanti West Coast service to Birmingham New Street, and this rattling black cab skimming the edge of the city, to West Bromwich. I am here for the Sportsman Club, which is a Desi pub. The word Desi refers to the south Asian origins of these boozers. They first began to appear in the likes of west London, Leicester and here in the West Midlands in the 1950s. They served men from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh who, after partition, had come to the UK to work, often without their families. They were, and remain, third spaces; places where those men could get fed in a familiar and comforting way, amid the comfort of others. Now they sit right at the heart of the communities of which they are a significant part, open to all, knocking out heaving plates of the cheap and the cheerful, and bringing a beautifully precise extra dimension to British pub culture. I found the Sportsman Club via Simon Carlo’s ever insightful Meat &amp; One Veg blog. It’s not the prettiest of places. It’s a big, airy modern pub built for maximum capacity, but there’s no doubting its pubbiness. The local darts team’s trophies are displayed at the front. There’s a long bar with Cobra, Worthington’s and Carling, among others, available by the pint. Get two of those for £7.60, a price that will make beer drinkers in other parts of the UK weep quietly. Come back to the bar to order your food from the long, laminated menu; a list of dishes mostly familiar from the British high-street curry-house tradition: think lamb bhuna and chicken jalfrezi, prawn masala and, being the West Midlands, baltis of various flavour, mostly priced between £7 and £10. Throw in a few samosas, bhajis, breads and biryanis. And chips. Go and wait with a drink in one of the booths in the huge, dimly lit dining room at the back. Visible off to the side is the kitchen, with its grills for the long list of kebabs. There are two of us, so obviously we start with the huge mixed grill for three for £25.50, salad and sweet-sour chutneys included. We want to make our loved ones love us even more by carting home the leftovers. The star is the boneless chicken tikka, made exclusively from thigh. It may be a slightly vivid cartoon shade of red, but the skin is hot and crisp and the meat beneath that crunch is tender and juicy. There are bigger pieces of satisfyingly bone-in chicken tikka and a load of superbly crusty spiced chicken wings, blackened and seared. We are eating on a Monday, which is a shame because I suspect the lamb seekh kebabs were fabulous on Sunday. Ours are a little dry and tired. Move on. At the bottom of the menu is a list of chef’s specials, including the Desi bakra lamb curry on the bone. Do not miss that. It’s a wonder of thick, spiced ghee-rich gravy and bone marrow suckage, topped with fresh coriander and onion. The meat just tumbles off into the heavily spiced depths. Listed above that is the Indo-Chinese section, full of sweeter tones. I love the chilli fish, the fillets first crusted in gram flour and deep-fried to a crunch before being turned in the sauce. Saag aloo, the green of a churning winter sea, is a soothing, ferrous balm to the soul. We sweep away at it all with crisp, flaky pieces of hot plain naan, and its Peshwari cousin filled with sweet, fragrant almond paste. Order fish fingers or chicken nuggets and chips for the kids if they find this proposition a bit much for now. Finish with a £2 scoop of ice-cream. Vanilla, chocolate or strawberry. Why, what were you expecting? Settle back into a brilliant place that’s an effortless marker for true diversity. And then, having ordered cleverly, take home those leftovers. So what if your luggage is somewhat fragrant on the train back? You’ve won at lunch. Go on Ian, stick that in your spreadsheet. News bites The Trussell Trust, which runs 1,300 appallingly over-subscribed food banks, has launched a new restaurant tipping scheme to help raise funds. Until August each year restaurants can sign up for a month or more to add a £1 ‘Tip for Trussell’ to diners’ bills. The scheme was initiated by the team at Islington pub the Draper’s Arms led by Nick Gibson. ‘People shouldn’t go without food in this country,’ Draper says. ‘We shouldn’t have to do this but the industry feeds people. Kudos to charity Streetsmart which led the way.’ Restaurants wishing to participate can do so via the Instagram account @atipfortrussell or by emailing nick@thedrapersarms.com James Martin, whose full restaurant ventures have generally been positively reviewed in this column, is to open two new ventures at the Lygon Arms in the Cotswold town of Broadway from next month. It follows on from the restaurant and cookery school he oversees at Chewton Glen in Hampshire, sister hotel to the Lygon Arms. The new restaurants will be a grill room, serving various cuts of meat and fish, and a ‘tavern’ offering a menu of fancy sausage rolls, scotch eggs and hot pork pies. Visit lygonarmshotel.co.uk Finally, and gloomily, research for the management consultancy company Begbies Traynor has found that nearly 20,000 hospitality business are under ‘significant financial distress’, a 36% increase year on year.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(24,'2023-02-26T06:00:13Z','Kino, Leeds: ‘Expect dramatic bursts of harissa and tahini’ – restaurant review','Kino, 34 New Briggate, Leeds LS1 6NU (0113 223 3700). Mezze and small plates £5-7.50, sharing plates £7.50-22, desserts £6, wines from £21.95 a bottle I have only ever attended one performance by the great Leeds-based company, Opera North. It was a 1987 production of Daphne by Richard Strauss, a work subtitled “a bucolic tragedy in one act” which, funnily enough, later became my fond nickname for the whole of Surrey. Daphne is about love and the caprices of the gods. It ends with our eponymous heroine becoming a tree. In truth, the whole thing made me extremely dizzy, although it turned out that this was on account of the German measles with which I was diagnosed the very next day, this being a year before the universal introduction of the life-saving MMR. Happy memories. While I have never quite found my way into opera, perhaps because I have never quite met the right opera, I have always admired Opera North. During the 80s, they went through the coolest of marketing rebrands: lots of moody black-and-white imagery, a love affair with blocky sans serif fonts and so on. Even if you never went to a performance, you wanted their posters on the wall of your student house. It made a nice change from the tennis player scratching her bum, or the bare-chested beefcake cradling a baby. Accordingly, I have always associated Opera North with the gentlest kind of innovation and that still seems to be the case. Attached to the Grand Theatre, their home on New Briggate, is a smart, modern brasserie with lots of wipe-down surfaces, eager waiters and precisely placed downlighters. It’s called Kino, a name which references the Howard Assembly Room on the other side, and its former life as a cinema. Instead of installing a permanent operator, they are giving it over to extended residencies. This lets them see what works and allows smaller outfits to have a crack at the bigger restaurant game. In a challenging period for hospitality, it’s a smart way to limit risk for all involved. Right now, it is occupied by MorMor, a Leeds-based street food business that describes itself as making “Levantine-inspired modern small plates and mezze”. That pretty much covers it. Expect dramatic bursts of harissa and tahini, labneh and dukkah. Expect to be cared for. Too often there is a hunger for restaurant reviews like this one to head to the margins; to be descriptions of the sensuous and the sublime, of angel’s kisses and delicious soft winds on our greedy cheeks, or of some gruesome culinary atrocity that should be tried by a special, well-catered court in the Hague. In truth, what we crave most of the time is just an agreeable night out, where the world can be put to rights and the bill won’t hurt. MorMor at Kino is indeed an agreeable night out, which is not to damn with faint praise. You may not flop back in your seat, your eyes and various other body parts moist with excitement. But you will feel that somebody gave a damn. It might be that nice waiter who keeps asking how everything is and genuinely seems to care about the answer. Start with the falafel, creamy at the centre rather than grainy, and lubricated by the fiery red mess of muhammara, that virtuous blitz of roasted red peppers and walnuts sweetened with pomegranate molasses. Follow that with a plate of their confited Jerusalem artichoke, roasted to dark toffeed caramel tones, with equally roasted fennel, on a bright sauce of tahini and preserved lemon. Slightly chewy florets of cauliflower come vigorously spiced with the citrus smack of sumac and the welcome whack of harissa, then battered and deep-fried. A properly fiery green chilli chutney and a roast garlic and lemon dip play chorus. The menu takes a slightly odd turn with the sudden appearance of pappardelle, like a wedding guest who didn’t quite understand the dress code. I imagine it’s there because someone in that kitchen has nailed the tricky business of making the silkiest, cravat-wispy, broad ribbons of pasta. Bravo. It is advertised as coming with anchovy butter, a combination of words that always gets me excitable. It turns out to be the silvery, acidic burst of marinated anchovies rather than the umami-rich thump of the salted. I am meant to say that my disappointment here is a matter of personal taste, although in truth I know it would be better with the salted variety because most things are. Still, the addition of a confited egg yolk and snowy gratings of parmesan help it all slip away very nicely. We are back on familiar territory with flatbreads stuffed with spiced lamb, which have then been fried so the crust is golden. On the side is a long-roasted, sumac-marinated onion. Do not miss the double-fried skin-on potatoes, which will have you poking around in the bottom of the bowl for the crispy bits. There are larger dishes, including a sharing plate of lamb chops for three, but the most fun is to be found in the largely non-meat small plates priced between £6 and £12. In places there is a mildly light hand on the salt. This is easily solved. Ask for the salt cellar. Bar the baklava, desserts are from the modern British bistro playbook. There’s a glazed lemon tart, a sticky toffee pudding and, cutely, given the location, a pistachio opera cake. They are bought in from elsewhere and do the job. MorMor should be at Kino until the end of April, but presumably can be found trading elsewhere after that. Do look them up. Other notes from this trip to Leeds: for pre-dinner drinks I headed to Quebec Street and the bar at the three-decade-old Sous le Nez, which is nobody’s idea of cool and all the better for that. The wine list is huge and leather-bound, but starts with a long and smart offering of wines under £30. The next day I went for lunch to the old Kirkgate Market, from where I used to buy thick slabs of fabulous bacon when I was a student. Now it is a smart mix of traditional stalls, many selling old-school cream cakes and intriguing, modern food stands. Head to the back and Mr Mackerel, a Turkish grill where you can get a soft white bun filled with a whole grilled fresh mackerel fillet with shredded red cabbage, salad and chillies. It’s fantastic. It’s probably the best £5 you can spend on lunch anywhere in Leeds right now. News bites Let’s start by gently raising an eyebrow at the menu offered by a new restaurant in San Diego called California English. The chef-restaurateur Richard Blais says he spent almost two months in London searching for inspiration. The result is a menu that includes a “Cornish Pasty”, which I have to put between quotation marks because it’s filled with oxtail, bone marrow and date chutney, an English Muffin “Pizza of the Day” and something called a Ploughman’s Salad. Best of all, for $10, you can have a bag of Walker’s Prawn Cocktail Crisps. And no, they don’t open the bag for you. californiaenglishsd.com Tommy Banks, head chef and proprietor of the Black Swan at Oldstead in Yorkshire, has launched a new podcast called Seasoned, focussing on the intricacies of running an ambitious restaurant supplied almost entirely by his family’s farm. Each episode a new guest will join Banks to explore a different aspect of the operation. They include cook and broadcaster Andi Oliver, comedian and writer Mel Giedroyc, London Evening Standard restaurant critic Jimi Famurewa and baker and broadcaster Ravneet Gill. Available wherever you get your podcasts. The team behind the highly regarded Marksman pub in London’s Hackney is to launch a second restaurant called Lasdun. It will be located inside the National Theatre on the Southbank and will be a brasserie with an oyster bar. The menu will include many of the dishes which made The Marksman’s name including pies to share, its beef and barley buns and a new spin on its fabulous brown butter and honey tart. marksmanpublichouse.com Email Jay at jay.rayner@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @jayrayner1 This article was amended on 26 February 2023 to correct the spelling of Lasdun restaurant.','https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/26/jay-rayner-restaurant-review-mormor-at-kino-opera-north-leeds-will-care-for-you-well','Jay Rayner','LS1 6NU',-1.54076802999999995,53.7998580899999865,0.0);

The queues at Wagamama and Bill’s snake out of their doors, and there are revellers everywhere, revelling. There is not a seat to be had at the mid-price, group-friendly likes of Côte, Browns and Ask. No, these restaurants don’t have the cool factor that small independents do, but there’s a sense that these big beasts will weather the winter freeze to come. Cool, on the other hand, is a fickle and expensive thing to pull off – one of the coolest restaurants I know just put a small plate of jerusalem artichokes up to £19.50, which feels like a lot. Increasingly, when booking a table for a group, the focus is firmly on the cheap and cheerful; somewhere with large tables, tolerable house white and food that fills you up. Into this testy landscape comes Tutto, a capacious, partially art-deco Euro-brasserie serving a menu they describe as “Italian food memories – ours and yours”. More accurately, they serve small portions of pappardelle at £14 a bowl or a chunk of sea bass on some sloppy shallots for £22, while a side of roast new potatoes comes in at a fiver. They don’t make pizzas, but they will do you a salumi board featuring finocchiona, coppa, speck and pickled fennel for £12. If this all feels a tad expensive, well, alas, such is the lie of the land these days: that very cool jerusalem artichoke place I mentioned earlier charges 23 smackers for its potato ravioli. Things are wild out there. Meanwhile, at the slightly more pocket-friendly Tutto, the lasagne “crocchetta” – two large lumps of breaded, deep-fried lasagne – cost a doable £7. But here’s the thing: somewhere in the hasty mass-frying of this lasagne, all the joy of oozing cheese or soothing bechamel or rich beef is lost, leaving you with sturdy slabs of breaded pasta sheets. They’ll line your stomach, but little else. Tutto is terribly lit, too; it is neither romantically twinkly nor usefully bright. They’ve spent a lot on art and the right paint, but the lighting makes it – and, by default, you – drab. Still, the staff are bright and friendly, and the bar can pull off a cold, well-balanced boulevardier, which you certainly won’t get at Pizza Express. The acoustics in the back room are also awful: when a table of 10 sat down next to us, the noise was so bad, I started having to communicate with Charles via WhatsApp. Tutto’s biggest problem by far, however, is its food – or, rather, the discrepancy between the dream of its food as presented on the menu, suggesting sublime produce and balmy feasts, and the crushing reality that there are chefs here who can’t cook pasta. Both the pappardelle and the tagliatelle were woefully undercooked in places. Tagliatelle cacio e pepe with black truffle should be a bombardment of richly sauced ecstasy; it turned up almost undressed, with a thin, lightly peppered sauce at the bottom of the bowl. The server delivered a salt grinder, so I gave it a few scooches. Now I had the very same pasta with lumps of rock salt in it. Slow-braised beef shin pappardelle was slightly better, but it was a million miles from the painstaking versions made at Trullo or Bancone. A small burrata arrived with what was promised as black fig and autumnal caponata, but what came was a very vinegary, brown aubergine stew topped with a few untoasted pine nuts and two slices of damp, unlovable fig. My guess is this is a menu written by someone who genuinely loves Italian food and wants to offer osso buco with gremolata to hungry crowds, but the raw materials just aren’t of a good enough quality. It would take Angela Hartnett doing overtime to make that fig even vaguely edible, and I believe she’s already quite busy. The sea bass, meanwhile, which was cooked through but unseasoned and weirdly wet, was served on top of a pale mush of shallot, wild mushrooms and confit garlic. This dinner will not be waxed lyrically about on my deathbed. We ordered the chocolate torte for pudding, expecting nothing, only for it to be one of the best desserts I’ve had in ages. I’d envisaged a slice of drab tart, but what appeared resembled a souped-up Feast chocolate ice lolly laid on its side and encrusted with hazelnuts. It was truly excellent: a firm, delicious shell filled with very good, rich, sticky ganache and a big scoop of fior di latte ice-cream on a bed of yet more hazelnuts. In fact, whoever came up with that pudding should be put in charge of the whole menu. Tutto will feel strange to passing Italians – a reimagining of their homeland that won’t make them homesick one little bit. Tutto 20-22 Marlborough Place, Brighton, East Sussex, 01273 031595.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(26,'2023-03-10T12:00:01Z','Dorothy & Marshall, Bromley: ‘A menu so short, it’s hard to regard the place as much more than a cafe’ – restaurant review | Grace Dent on restaurants','Bromley, to the south-east of London, hasn’t made cultural waves since 1976, when the Sex Pistols, Siouxsie Sioux and the “Bromley Contingent” called Bill Grundy a “dirty fucker” live on ITV. Bromley, I learned at an early age, was where the punks came from. It later transpired that Siouxsie actually came from Chislehurst and others in the Bromley Contingent were from the likes of Orpington, Burnt Oak and Highgate, although it was Bromley that, in the nation’s eyes, carried the can as a hotbed of cultural dissent, potty mouths and septic piercings. I’d have loved to have been a fly on the wall in the town hall at the time: the scandal and rumpus must have been terrific. More recently, however, this grade II-listed building has been subjected to an extremely tasteful renovation, preserving all the ostentatiousness of a 1906 local government building, with its fluted concrete columns, stained-glass windows and vaulted doors, while reviving the walls and panelling with litres of soothing, pseudo-Soho House shades of sage-green, pale biscuit, shimmering gold and ombré. It is gorgeous and reeks of every penny of its £20m re-fit. Dorothy &amp; Marshall, a “traditional British restaurant”, takes up a sizeable chunk of the new space, with the rest available as meeting spaces, podcast studios and a forthcoming boutique hotel. The restaurant has about it the feel of a masonic lodge or Quaker meeting house, but I’ll take quirky over drab any day; I like my burger with a side of history. The real issue right now is that, for a restaurant so capacious and boldly styled, the menu is so short, it’s hard to regard the place as much more than a cafe. On opening in late 2022, they released a brief, 10-item list featuring a fancy burger, fish and chips, roast cauliflower steak with sauce vierge and a puff pastry baby artichoke tart. The starters were a beetroot salad, a ham hock terrine and battered cod cheeks. So, the menu was short and to the point, but, in fairness, the place was only just getting started. By March 2023, however, it is still short and sweet, except on Saturdays, when it becomes an even shorter brunch menu on which the cauliflower, cod cheeks, fish and chips and artichoke tart are replaced by eggs and avocado on sourdough, eggs benedict and french toast; the £17.60 “homemade Trenchmore beef burger” is still there, though. On the Saturday lunchtime when we visited, Dorothy &amp; Marshall was almost completely deserted, possibly because someone spent so very much on the fixtures and fittings that there’s no budget left to offer a menu worth leaving home for. Service is delightful, incidentally. It’s prompt and friendly, they made me a great spicy Virgin Mary, and the slice of brioche french toast with pools of candied mint was gorgeous. It’s hardly their fault that £7.60 for a single slice of eggy bread with one sliced strawberry seems to be the going rate these days. Similarly, a small warm potato pancake came topped with good-quality Severn &amp; Wye smoked salmon, a caperberry and a smattering of creme fraiche, and all for £11.30. By this point in proceedings, I had eaten two breakfasts and was still as hungry as I’d been when I’d arrived. Nowadays, I often feel like an actor in a restaurant scene who is paid to do pretend eating while chuntering “rhubarb, rhubarb” at other extras. I go through the motions – the seating, the napkin, the smiling at staff, the chewing, the paying of the bill – then I’m out on the street again, saying: “Blimey, that was peculiar. What’s for lunch?” The pudding list offered three choices at £8.30 a throw: chocolate cheesecake, sticky toffee pudding and “old boys orange and lemon jam roly poly with custard”. Having spent much of my childhood peering impatiently at a hissing Heinz spotted dick or golden honey sponge pudding, I am generally weakened by any mention of suet pud, but my other half, being French, cannot stand any of these damp, dense, fatty desserts that come with creme anglaise. Why do we make our puddings so dry, he wails, that they need a jug of bland moistness to make them remotely edible? Clearly this is nonsense, because roly-poly is brilliant and, surprisingly, Dorothy &amp; Marshall’s take on it is especially good; it may not be enormous, but it packs a hearty punch of soft, warm sponge and thrilling, citrus-laden jam. The custard came in a small jug that I put to my lips, and it was magical. I fear that this is a restaurant that, like so many of its contemporaries, can stay open only by making small things stretch a very long way, and serving them to a curious audience bearing a lot of goodwill.

Small plates £6.55-£12.55, BBQ items £8.95-£11.95, rice and noodle dishes £11.95-£13.55, dessert £6.95, sake and rice wine £9.50 for 125ml Modern food preparation technology is to be celebrated: it’s cleaner, more energy efficient and just simpler to use than the old ways. The thing is, it’s not very romantic. No one will ever write emotionally dense prose about the functioning of a 1200-watt convection oven. They might write something full of knowing bathos, but not a sentence to make the heart flutter. Whereas the steel cauldron of glowing coals, brought to our table at Jinseon Korean BBQ Restaurant in Coventry, is the very stuff of legend. By which I mean Norse legend full of vainglorious, blood-smeared men hunkering down by the fire in the night-dark forest clearing, to cook that day’s hunt while telling each other stories of their bravery. As the stocky man dressed in ash-smudged black heaves that cauldron into its resting place, sparks fly and ribbons of white smoke pirouette heavenwards. We feel the heat on our cheeks and our forearms and upon our very cave-dweller souls. See. Real flames, or man’s red fire as dear King Louie called it in the Jungle Book, just do the thing. It’s rare to see it at the table these days. The last time I came across smouldering coals was at the gloriously mad Seveni, opposite the Imperial War Museum. Before that it was in 2009 at Soot Bull Jeep, a dark cubbyhole of a restaurant famed for being the last BBQ place in LA’s Koreatown to use them. The rest now seem to favour electric hotplates. And yes, I know it’s health and safety gone sane, but still. That said, I do give thanks for the modern, industrial-scale extractor system that dangles down over every table from the high ceiling here at the back. I want to eat my lunch, not be asphyxiated by it. Jinseon is part of a cluster of Asian restaurants and supermarkets crowded around a modern square opposite the HQ of BBC Coventry and Warwickshire. The existence of these places, serving Chengdu hot pot and the like, is a tribute to a relatively new market created by an influx of students from various parts of Asia; you’ll find them in many, if not all university towns these days. It’s clear that Jinseon is here to serve that customer base with as much unalloyed enthusiasm as possible. The menu begins with various takes on Korean fried chicken, that double-fried wonder doused in enough gochujang-fuelled sauce to paint the entire town centre red. Attaching morals to food has always troubled me. Sure, you can call me dirty, probably fairly, but a high-stacked burger can no more be dirty than a salad can be clean. The word to describe Korean fried chicken is messy, made more so in the “dirty” offering here, by the addition of melted mozzarella, cheddar cheese and a fistful of jalapenos. Nobody needs the addition of melted cheese to double-fried, highly sauced chicken. But then nobody needs that chicken in the first place. It’s very much in “want” territory. I wanted it. To go on the grill, we have thin, marinated pieces of beef short rib, sliced through the bone, and similarly buzz-sawed pieces of lamb with cumin, both around £11 for a fair portion. These are not the finest pieces of meat, but once the sugar-rich marinades start to caramelise over the burning coals, who cares? We have a variety of sweet sticky chilli sauces to go with them alongside kimchi and crunchy bowls of iceberg lettuce leaf to wrap them in, if you can be faffed with the admin. As ever, Korean barbecue brings with it an awful lot of admin. In this case, it also brings a certain amount of work for the kitchen. The wide rim of the steel fitting into which the cauldron fits contains curved metal compartments. A yellow liquid is poured into one from a teapot. It’s beaten egg which, with a little encouragement from our forks, will slowly scramble courtesy of the heat. Another contains sweetcorn kernels with cheese that caramelise. Both are a delightful side show to be picked at compulsively, but I become genuinely anxious about the way they crust the tray. How in God’s name do they get that off? Looks like a boil job to me. The menu has some intriguing soupy dishes, including Budae Jjigae at £25 for two, described as a “popular Korean-American fusion stew derived after the Korean war”. The main mark of this fusion is the inclusion of spam alongside the tofu, kimchi, ramen noodles and cheese. I don’t fancy spam today, or ever, as it happens. Instead, we have a seafood bibimbap, a furiously hot iron pot full of rice topped with mussels, shrimps and squid. It achieves much of its effect through dollops of sweet chilli sauce, but leave it a while and a slab of the prized scorched rice develops at the bottom that you can fight over. We also have a seafood pajeon, the famed cross between a pancake and an omelette. It has taken us so long to explore the joys of the grill that it has become tepid. We throw pieces of the pajeon over the coals for a few minutes and it crisps up delightfully. The people behind Jinseon own a café elsewhere in town serving both Korean fried chicken and croffles, which, like the cruffin and the cronut, is a hybrid baked good involving a croissant, in this case shoved into a waffle iron. You get both the requisite flaky lamination and waffle holes to fill with stuff. They are offered here as dessert and strike me as proof of humanity’s unending ability to innovate and embellish, especially when it’s completely unnecessary. I am very much here for the croffle. Ours comes crusted with cinnamon-boosted sugar with a bowl of soft serve ice-cream, caramelised popcorn and a little fruit. Oh, and a ceramic polar bear sitting proud in the middle of the plate. Because, well just because. I learned about Jinseon from the fine Rugby-based journalist Ellen Manning who blogs at eatwithellen.com. She worried, when I invited her to join me, that it wouldn’t be as good as other Korean restaurants I’ve tried. It really is, in a fully engaging way. Anywhere that can still be bothered with the faff of burning coals is good by me. But also, in truth, we know the best Korean barbecue is probably somewhere in Korea. What matters is that Coventry has this rough wood panel-clad space offering a very good time to anyone up for the joys of cooking their own lunch. News bites London’s Borough Market is staging a series of events in the run-up to Christmas hosted by cook and food writer Angela Clutton, author of the just published Borough Market: The Knowledge. Next Tuesday she’ll by joined by Cynthia Shanmugalingam to discuss her debut cookbook Rambutan which draws on her Anglo-Sri Lankan heritage.

Tickets are available here. The charity Guide Dogs for the Blind has launched a campaign highlighting the issue of guide dog owners illegally being refused access to businesses, including restaurants and bars. Recent research has found that 81% of guide dog owners have experienced some form of access refusal, with 73% saying it has happened in the past year. Additional research found that one in five hospitality staff were unaware that refusing a guide dog is illegal, and half of them said they would struggle to identify an assistance dog from a pet. Visit this website for more information on the campaign. Chef Phil Howard, of restaurants Elystan Street and Kitchen W8, has changed the name of the pasta restaurant he is about to open in Piccadilly. It will now be called Notto rather than Otto, to avoid confusion with the much-loved French restaurant Otto’s, which has been trading on Gray’s Inn Road for almost a decade.

So I did, and it has now ruined the likes of St Barts for me for ever. Fiennes plays a chef who offers an intricate, highly personal tasting menu that is tweezered into position by an earnest brigade who would live or, so it seems, die by his word. It is one hour 47 minutes of wincingly observed comedy horror about my life; there’s even an abrasive, immensely killable female restaurant critic picking her way through the jus, sap and petals for errors. She’ll regret this. Hours after watching the film, I’m in a spacious, Scandi-esque spot overlooking the church of St Bartholomew the Great on a misshapen chair carved from fallen London plane trees. My bottom is cosseted by a soft, sheepskin throw, while a fiercely focused young chef serves me a snack of Welsh wagyu tartare dotted with lovingly pickled wild garlic buds that he personally picked last year. This is followed by the world’s fanciest mini-Hobnob, made with cobnuts and topped with duck liver, before a perfectly spherical cod fritter takes me on a journey of exquisite joy. It turns out I’ve chanced upon the people behind St Barts before, and am almost certain they mean me no harm throughout this thoroughly British tasting menu. Johnnie Crowe, Luke Wasserman and Toby Neill opened the rather good Fenn in Fulham, and before that Nest in Hackney, although St Barts, with its 15-course, £120 tasting menu that lasts more than four hours, was always the dream. No matter what a film such as The Menu says about the bizarre world of fine dining and its fans, the place is packed on a cold January evening, with guests who see food as art, made to be gasped and cogitated over, before sliding down one’s gullet in a matter of seconds. The mouthful of golden beef broth, for example, which turns up in a small earthenware mug “to warm you”. Or the intricately spun onion tart, which is really just a bhaji, though in chef Crowe’s hands looks much as I imagine the hay that Rumpelstiltskin spun to gold. Or the individual pieces of fine bresaola, served on a shiny, black slate. If you are hoping to fill your belly to the brim with oily carbohydrates or enjoy the clatter of the pudding trolley bringing black forest gateau to your table, then I will politely point you elsewhere. Here at St Barts, you will linger in the bar area for almost an hour, being fed tiny tastes of “East End seafood cocktail” – smoked eel, clam and caviar – in an oyster shell or “duck offal porridge”, which tastes exactly as you might imagine: it is a powerfully pungent, iron-laden, sticky puddle and certainly not for everyone. If you are a meat-eater who shies away from the nitty-gritty of animal products, St Barts may well test you. A later beef course is served with a tongue and heart stew, which other restaurants might have skirted around, but St Barts fesses up so clearly. Service is warm and prompt, which is just as well, because you’re here for a good time and not a short time. Although it occasionally feels as if there isn’t a great deal of food portion-size-wise, what does appear is often exquisite and remarkable. A stew of scallop with fierce red pepper is outstanding, as are a tiny piece of precisely cooked cod topped with preserved fungi, a suggestion of duck breast served with fewer than a dozen lingonberries, and a sublime tablespoon of crab and British ginger, zinging with freshness and served on a minuscule muffin. St Barts is one of London’s most notable new openings, a place to take the food obsessive in your life for a special occasion and watch them get severely het up about the minute honey and lavender ice-cream cone that arrives before the main dessert event, which, on the evening we went, was a sort of celeriac and praline pastry stack that by no means convinced me that celeriac is a replacement for apple or pear, but this isn’t the sort of evening to rest on one’s laurels about likes or dislikes. This is a fancy, multi-course tasting menu with pre-paid tickets, and you will end up on whatever flight of fancy the chef desires and be very grateful for it afterwards. In the past, I have seen people rebel halfway through dinners such as this and start demanding a side of mashed potato; let’s just say it didn’t end well for them, although not as bleakly as it does for the guests in The Menu. The trick is just to relax and eat the frankly weird walnut celeriac, then accept the tiny bun in a hemp sack that chef insists you heat up for breakfast the next morning. The world of fine dining is weird, but I’ll take weird over normal any day. • This article was amended on 20 January 2023 to name the fairytale spinner of gold from straw as Rumpelstiltskin rather than Rapunzel. • Restaurant St Barts 63 Bartholomew Close, London EC1, 020-4547 7985.

Starters and small plates £7-£12, mains £14-£24, desserts £7, wines from £21 Early in my happy adventures as a gigging musician, putting my ragbag of borrowed licks and boundless, puppyish enthusiasm before very kind audiences, I had an epiphany. Whatever my ambitions, I was not required to have mastered the piano completely before playing for people. The jazz world may be strewn with mighty saxophonists who turn up to gigs bellowing “any tune, any key, any tempo”. To me, they are God-like figures. But I did not have to be, indeed could never be, like them. Instead, I simply had to be able to play the tunes I was performing at that moment. Back then the audience did not need to know that there was not much else beyond the 10-song set they’d just heard. I would still be, and indeed remain, the best jazz pianist of all the British restaurant critics. There’s a lot to be said for being good over a narrow bandwidth; for doing a small number of things really well, rather than trying to prove your exhausting high-trapeze virtuosity. I thought about this while studying the brown-paper menu at L’Hexagone in Norwich. It is the tiny French restaurant that really can. It is the sort of place we could all do with more of, when money is tight and we need to take our pleasures with care. The decor of the small space, on a narrow slab-stoned alley, is what I’ve just defined to myself as Refined Goth: the walls are painted black. Downstairs is a bar with seating for at least, ooh, six. Upstairs, past the spray-painted words “liberté, égalité, fraternité”, is a dining room seating another mighty 20. In keeping with the very smallness of it all, that lunch menu runs to barely 50 French words. They are, however, great French words: a distillation of southern French country cooking down to its essentials. The cook is Frenchman Thomas Aubrit, son of a cook, nephew of a butcher. His English wife, Gemma, whom he met at the restaurant he was working in back in France, runs front-of-house. Come early and they’ll do you really good coffee, pastries and a croque monsieur or madame. Come for lunch and it’s soup, salads and a bunch of cheery things involving beef. That really is the sum of it: to over-extend this jazz-food analogy until it submits a letter of resignation, it’s a tight nightclub set that hits all the right notes, and most definitely in the right order. The £12 salade niçoise is a pleasingly dense, chopped affair, with a pretty arrangement of anchovies and tomatoes, topped by half a boiled egg, its yolk at a perfect state of jamminess. A tomato tartine is a crisply toasted piece of sourdough smeared thickly with garlic-boosted tapenade and laid with slices of beef tomato, closely zigzagged with stripes of thick pungent pistou, the French answer to pesto only with a little Gallic swagger. Eat the tartine with your hands and you’ll be smelling your lunch on your fingertips for hours after, in a happy way. There is, of course, steak frites, or a bavette with a shallot sauce. Cheaper, gnarlier cuts get the only treatment they understand: stewed until breaking down into threaded fragments, in a tomatoey stew with black olives, new potatoes and the lofty insistence of fennel seeds. The special today is a steak tartare, a properly dressed affair, with a golden egg yolk at its centre and a big heap of hand-cut chips, still tipped with the fat-wrinkled skins. It’s a generous heap for £24. We could now play “guess the desserts”, but the game won’t last very long, will it? You know it will include chocolate mousse; a soft, slightly grainy milk chocolate version topped with chocolate flakes, all of which melts away to nothing on the tongue. Yes, there’s a butter-yellow crème brûlée, the burnt sugared surface just begging for the crack of the teaspoon. Have the vanilla panna cotta with the fruit purée if you like, but mine’s still that crème brûlée, eaten until I’ve run the edge of my spoon all the way round the terracotta bowl to remove all the crusty, sugary bits. In the evenings, there’s a 14-course tasting menu, each dish evoking the profound landscape of Provence. Don’t be silly. Of course there isn’t. That would be exhausting. It’s exactly the same tight, enticing proposition, perhaps with the addition of a fish dish. It’s just a bunch of simple things done very well and with true, beguiling charm. To go with it, drink something sweetly familiar from the short wine list that hasn’t heard of anywhere outside France. Almost all of it is available by the glass; almost all of it is under £40. Don’t come to L’Hexagone expecting life-changing drama. Come here expecting to be fed. Incidentally, the name is a French nickname for the shape of their country. I did not know this and now I do. Every day is a school day. While I’m loitering in Norwich, I have to mention chef Jimmy Preston’s XO Kitchen, which, in its own way, also sticks within a narrow frame, in this case a cheeky, magpie-like romp across Asian flavours. They knew I was coming, indeed allowed me to order in advance because otherwise I would have been too late for last orders. Therefore, this can’t quite be considered a review, but I adored the face-slapping flavours so much they have to be mentioned. Come for the char sui pork belly, both charred and wobbly under a brain-blasting rust-coloured sauce, with a heap of pickled cucumber and a dollop of Norwich-appropriate Colman’s Mustard. Sooth the mustard burn with the watermelon salad, in a big soupy dressing heaped with mint, peanuts and fresh chilli. Do order the beef massaman, a lush coconut curry, with a hacked-off chunk of bone, the well filled with wobbly, hot, bone marrow. Special praise is reserved for their BBQ hispi cabbage, with a black bean dressing and a golden, crispy rubble that Preston calls XO seasoning. So, what is that exactly, Jimmy? “Well,” he says slowly. “You need a pork element for XO so that’s crushed-up Frazzles. And then you need dried seafood so that’s Scampi Fries.” He looks away. “Monster Munch might also have been involved.” If you are appalled by that, what are you doing reading this column? It’s utter genius. The rest of you, go to Norwich. Lunch at L’Hexagone. Dinner at XO Kitchen. Or the other way round. I really don’t care. Either way, job done. News bites Fancy lunch at your local supermarket? Then you’re in luck. Boparan Restaurant Group, which owns a bunch of high street brands including Gourmet Burger Kitchen, Slim Chickens and Caffè Carluccio, has opened its first ‘Restaurant Hub’ inside a branch of Sainsbury’s in Sydenham, south London.

The Hawksmoor steakhouse group, which is shortly to open an outpost in Liverpool to go alongside those in London, Manchester, Edinburgh and New York, has become one of the few restaurant companies in the UK to be certified as a B Corp business. The certification, by the non-profit B Lab network, means they have been assessed to bring benefit not just to their shareholders, but also to their employees, customers and to the environment. They will be reassessed every three years. Visit thehawksmoor.com. Staff shortages are endemic across the economy, but it seems the hospitality sector really is suffering more than most. According to analysis of data from the Office of National Statistics by Koozai, a digital marketing agency, well over a third of food and accommodation businesses are having problems recruiting the skilled staff they need.

Clearly, it’s lovely to receive them, yet, in the case of the Old Stamp House in the Lake District, chef Ryan Blackburn woke one morning last year to find himself in charge of “The Best Fine Dining Restaurant in the World”, according to the TripAdvisor Travellers’ Choice awards, a title it won again this year. The name of the award is deliciously Douglas Adams and, as the booking line went ballistic, you wouldn’t blame Blackburn for thinking, “What have we done?” The restaurant may already have had a Michelin star, among other awards, for serving fine, painstakingly orchestrated, hyper-local Cumbrian produce, but it had never claimed to rival the likes of Noma in Copenhagen, with its dozens of staff and £600-plus a head menu. I’m a firm believer, however, that small and homespun is often more beautiful, and the Old Stamp House, which opened in 2014, is very much a family affair: front of house is Craig, Ryan’s brother, and he’ll be pouring your wine. It’s intimate, too, occupying two rooms in a building where William Wordsworth once worked as the distributor of stamps for Westmorland. This is a restaurant that exudes cosy, self-effacing charm, rather than slick, drilled service and a lecture with every course. On arrival, a letter from the chef awaits you at the table, explaining, and I paraphrase, that waffling on in your ear for each of the nine or so courses about ingredients, techniques and the inside leg measurement of the man who hand-dived the scallop may spoil your enjoyment of the food, so he’s decided to shut up and write it all in this letter. That introduction is followed by approximately 600 neatly typed words on Walney and Roa Island scallops, the small fishing fleets of Barrow and Whitehaven, Grizedale Forest stags and the Herdwick lamb that’s farmed just five miles up the road at Yew Tree Farm. The letter quietly screams a love of modern Cumbria and old Cumberland, but it also taught me a dozen lessons along the way. No, I did not know that cumberland sauce was invented for the Hanoverian prince Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland. Or that one farmer in the Eden Valley is now selling excellent, refined rapeseed oil that’s perfect for dipping bread made with Last Wolf beer from Cartmel. The Old Stamp House is not one of the Lake District’s many soulless, oversubscribed dining spots that nail up a few paintings of Blencathra, make a cursory nod to Beatrix Potter and rob you blind for reheated Aunt Bessie roast potatoes. This is a brave and sentimental project that has clearly won a lot of hearts. The menu is fancy, yet ultimately hearty. Opening treats of black pudding bonbons dressed with pickled apple and light, whipped beetroot macarons filled with duck liver give way to Herdwick hogget wrapped in a heavenly bun and served with a sipping broth that is essentially a small jug of exquisite lamb gravy. A cleansing, Scandi-feeling bowl of Arctic char arrives, rolled ornately and prettily strewn with vivid-orange cured roe, apple, cucumber and horseradish. It’s delightful and delicate. Then a warming hug of potted shrimps, a large, luscious scallop in a curried mead velouté and a generous roast cod loin in mussel and vermouth sauce. You will not leave this place hungry, even if you don’t inhale that beer bread with Winter Tarn Dairy butter. The final hurrah of the savoury section was loin of Cumbrian red deer with a clever, celeriac-based twist on ravioli stuffed with hen of the wood and served with a truffle sauce; lest that isn’t enough, they also send out a heavenly spin on cottage pie made with the rich, braised shank of the same deer topped with a yeasty celeriac froth. It’s the kind of dish that’s both dainty and would also feasibly power you across Haystacks. There are two puddings: a sweet, creamy, relatively light one made with meadowsweet, raspberries and a tiny nod towards local gingerbread, plus a heroic, high and mighty pear-and-bramble delice souffle that is a work of art. The sad thing about souffles is how rapidly they go from exquisite beauty to destruction. They are the food world’s mayflies, living their very best life for only a matter of moments, before disappearing down the throat of a food critic, who everyone is too polite to tell has smears of the Valrhona chocolate and almond sauce on her nose. The Old Stamp House has won prizes for being very romantic, which it is, but I took a 15-year-old relative and she thoroughly loved the food and the unfussy but still low-key fabulous atmosphere. I cannot say empirically if this is the best restaurant in the entire universe, but I know it’s taken the role to heart and is having a very good go. The Old Stamp House, Church Street, Ambleside, Cumbria, 01539 432775. Open lunch Thu-Sat, 12.30-1.30pm (last orders), dinner Wed-Sat, 6-8.30pm (last orders).

Bar snacks and starters £8-£18, mains £19-£36, desserts £10-£12, wines from £29 A lot of money, and most of the world’s fairy lights, have gone into making London’s Mayfair look pretty at this time of year. Even so, the place just can’t help being ugly. Outside Berkeley Street’s Novikov – owned by a man who once boasted to me about being Vladimir Putin’s favourite caterer – the crowds are still clamouring to get through the twinkly light-crusted doors for £18 bowls of mediocre minestrone. Up on the other side of Berkeley Square is Bacchanalia, Richard Caring’s latest attempt to make Vegas look classy. It’s seemingly styled after a faux Greco-Roman knocking shop, complete with a Damien Hirst sculpture of “winged lovers embracing on a unicorn”. They have just posted their opening menu outside: a dozen oysters for £64? Or how about 125g of Beluga for £935? Sod it, have both. Meanwhile, inside the door of the newly renovated Barley Mow pub just north of Grosvenor Square, they’re screening the Belgium v Canada World Cup match. I have no interest in football. I do not understand how anyone attaches their emotional wellbeing to the activities of 11 people they’ve never met (a minority opinion on the day of the World Cup final, I grant you). Even so, I find the TVs deeply reassuring. We may be in Mayfair, where it’s hard to find a lip that has not been filled or a colon that has not been irrigated. But there are still vestiges of normality: Guinness and London Brewing Co’s Upright on draught, and the match to stare at while drinking them. But do take a look around: at the gorgeous etched glass windows and the deep dark varnish sheen of the bar. Now come up the narrow stairs to the dining room, where the tablecloths are thick and there’s a honeyed amber glow from the art deco ceiling lights and sconces. Here they have a glass-fronted cabinet for their collection of Neal’s Yard cheeses. The Barley Mow was purchased earlier this year by Cubitt House, a company that has for a while now been giving glossy, robust makeovers to a group of central London pubs, including the Alfred Tennyson in Knightsbridge and the Princess Royal in Notting Hill. These are pubs for people with very clean boots. The Barley Mow is now being managed with a steady hand by Lara Rogers, who is as close to pub royalty as it gets these days. She learned her trade working alongside her father, Oisin Rogers, famed landlord most recently of the nearby Guinea Grill. But for our purposes what really matters is the food, which is overseen by Ben Tish, formerly of the Game Bird. He has come up with an offering as butch and beguiling as the fit-out. Start with a bar menu of sausage rolls with their own brown sauce or a haggis scotch egg. Better still, try the hot meat bun, a tottering construction of brioche roll toasted to a smoky char, stacked with slices of slow-cooked beef and pickles, with a jug of extra gravy on the side for a bit of a French dip. Like all the best foods, it’s shirt-destroying messy. In a town infested by over-engineered burgers, it’s more than just a pleasing novelty. Or drop your elbows on to those thick tablecloths upstairs and order the fresh cockles in the shell. Cockles are more than an equal to palourde clams. These come in a hot liquid swamp of garlicky parsley butter and offer huge shell-suckage opportunities. If that’s just too much mess, have a slab of the gamey terrine en croûte, in a glazed picture frame of hot-water pastry, the jewel green of the pistachios shining through. It’s served at exactly the right temperature, so the jelly is just starting to melt. For mains there is, of course, a beef pie with mash and parsley sauce (deep-fried oyster optional). There’s Dover sole various ways and a daily changing roast. Today there are two, although I don’t quite get to hear them mention the sirloin, because I say yes before our waiter gets to the “y” in pork belly. It is a slow-cooked, tender brick with both big puffs of crackling and a herb-stuffed round of the loin, sliced and crisped. With it comes their bronzed gratin dauphinoise. They warn me it’s made with anchovies, which I regard as a recommendation. It is closing on Jansson’s temptation territory. That’s never a bad thing. Alongside half a chicken, hot-roasted so the skin is dark and slightly chewy, comes a jug of sage and truffle butter. There are many places in London for a light supper, full of subtlety and grace. This is not one of them. You can order some seasonal greens if you like. But over there under “sides” it mentions house fries with roasted garlic aioli and a Westcombe curd aligot. Choices have to be made. Who am I to judge, what with gravy dripping down my forearms and a beard full of parsley butter? If that image isn’t helping you, give thanks you weren’t on the other side of the table. How much is it all, you ask? Well, you know. It is still bloody Mayfair, where the asset managers roll up their sleeves, order big bottles of Bordeaux’s finest and bemoan the state of China’s economy. Tolerate the other clientele, as they do me. Look, it’s not as bad as at the newly opened restaurant above the nearby Audley, where the lobster pie for two is £96 and the rib-eye is £48. Which is me attempting to dodge the question. OK. It’s still pretty pokey here: £13 for that hot meat bun, £15 for the cockles, £36 for the pork, sides included. But unlike that place a couple of weeks ago where I complained about £100-a-head dinners for something that was just fine, this is so much more. That’s the problem with really expensive things. Yes, many are stupid and infuriating, but some are really nice. The Barley Mow is really nice. The dessert menu is a real one, with a baked Alaska for two and crêpes Suzette, and a sticky toffee pudding with clotted cream that is the only weak moment. The sponge should be saturated with sauce. Here it’s only been poured on at the end. Have the poire belle Hélène instead. It’s a perfectly poached pear crusted in biscuit crumb, with vanilla ice-cream and a chocolate sauce which, like me, has obvious depths. Then stumble downstairs, past the now dark TV screens, and out into the fairy-lit night, belly full and wallet empty. News bites The chef Mark Hix is in a planning battle with Dorset council over a decking structure he built at a cost of £20,000 for his Oyster and Fish House in Lyme Regis during the pandemic. The outdoor deck is in Lister Gardens, next to the restaurant, on space leased from the council. He has recently applied to extend the lease, but has been told the application will be turned down. In a letter to the council, he has argued that post-Covid trading conditions are still tough and that ‘the removal of the deck would undoubtably seriously impact upon our business and put the future of the restaurant in jeopardy.’ Hix is to launch a petition (theoysterandfishhouse.co.uk). Sad news from Edinburgh. Paul Kitching, the brilliant chef-proprietor of restaurant and boutique hotel 21212, has died suddenly aged 61. Before moving to the Scottish capital in 2010, he held a Michelin star at Juniper in Altrincham for over a decade, for many years the only restaurant in Greater Manchester to be so recognised. His food could be both bonkers and inspired. A hilarious meal at Juniper might include a salmon pink “spaghetti purée”, spelling out the word spaghetti to be spooned off the plate or mopped with bread, or tiny fried eggs, the whites made of sharp natural yoghurt, the yolks made of mango purée. It all sounds ludicrous and it often was, but it was always delicious. Kitching was that rare thing: a genuinely creative chef who knew how to manage his own creativity. He will be much missed. Tipjar, the cashless gratuity platform, has calculated that average restaurant takings were down 17% on rail strike days in October and November. Given the number of strike days in December, staff could lose around £15m in tips this month. Ben Thomas of Tipjar believes that this could amount to a loss of around £40 for employees. ‘While we align with workers speaking to improve pay and conditions,’ he has said. ‘Our job is to represent some of the lowest-paid workers whose income is directly related to footfall in their pubs and restaurants.’ Email Jay at jay.rayner@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @jayrayner1','https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/dec/18/the-barley-mow-london-infuriatingly-nice-restaurant-review','Jay Rayner','W1K 6JG',-0.151029999999999997,51.5129737899999966,0.0);

Starters and sides £4.50-£9.50, mains £13.50-£18, desserts £5.50, wines from £20 It is a dark, damp night in London’s W9. Rear lights reflect off wet roads, a gash of red against the black, and occasionally the constant growl of traffic on the Harrow Road is cut through by the distant Doppler of a police siren. And yet there is something here on this mostly residential street that reminds me of my sun-kissed time Greek island hopping so many years ago. It is the heavy waft of charcoal smoke and the encouraging top note of rendering fat; it’s the aromas I recall from the tavernas that huddled close to each other along every island quay front. That’s the thing about Tsiakkos &amp; Charcoal. You will smell it long before you find it and even when you find it you will doubt that you have. There is no signage on the turquoise frontage. There are pale red curtains drawn across both the windows and the window in the door, denying you sight of what’s going on inside. If the door is ajar, you may see a cluttered desk against the wall just inside, a computer perched amid the paperwork. Tonight, a World Cup game is playing on the computer screen. Do not be put off. Go inside. Walk past the front room’s open kitchen with its charcoal grill, tended by a couple of bearded men, to the half wood-panelled dining room at the back. Or, if you’re feeling intrepid, go sit under the heaters in the covered garden space out back, strung with fairy lights. But please, do go. Tsiakkos &amp; Charcoal is a reminder that amid the fetishising of the new by people like me, great places carry on doing great things year after year, untroubled by any of that. The fact that, to my shame, I had not heard of it, does not mean it’s obscure. It has cropped up in various round-ups of London’s Greek Cypriot restaurants over the years. It has occasionally been reviewed in more detail. I heard about it because the London Evening Standard asked 25 chefs to name their favourite cheap restaurants. Some of them – Padella, Hoppers, Kiln – were recommendations of nice high-profile places, without taking us off anybody’s beaten track. It was Josh Katz of Berber and Q who suggested Tsiakkos. “It feels like you’re eating inside somebody’s home,” he told the Standard. “The food is much like the restaurant: simple, rustic and packed full of charm and character.” Which makes me worry that I’ve subcontracted out this whole reviewing lark to Katz, because he’s not wrong. No wheels are reinvented, no envelopes pushed. The menu is short and built around a classic repertoire that speaks of another place of rocky hillsides and blue sky, a long way from here. The closest thing to a revelation is their hummus, which is homely, as if the chickpeas have been broken up with a fork, rather than blitzed. It is hefty and grainy and can be spooned away neat, though you will get a basket of pitta for £1 served warm, and just crying out to be pressed into service. Use it, too, on the high whipped peaks of their taramasalata, which is barely on nodding terms with the astringent Day-Glo pink stuff flogged by the plastic potful on the high street. It is soothing and creamy and just right. Partner it with thick slabs of halloumi, charcoal grilled, then dribbled in olive oil and lemon juice. These platefuls will set you back a mighty fiver or so each. Throw in a crisp salad, heavy with pickled peppers and salty kalamata olives. Wellness hucksters waste gushing Channel Tunnel’s-worth of digital bandwidth on perky videos full of white teeth and glossy hair and ideas for healthy eating that look like hope dying on a plate. Treat those videos with the disdain they deserve. Just come here and eat Greek Cypriot food and feel both better about yourself and properly looked after. The looking after is done tonight by one young woman who manages the constant flood of customers with a glorious ease as if she just happened to be passing through and might as well bring these plates of your dinner as she’s going that way. And yet nobody is left waiting. I ask her how long the restaurant has been here. She smiles and says: “At least as long as I’ve been alive.” She tells me she’s 27. There are three charcoal grills and three oven-baked dishes on offer. The latter, all priced in the mid-teens, are a moussaka and a kleftiko, and what they call the slow-burnt pork. It’s a big pile of shoulder, which has loitered in the oven for most of the day until, as the menu says, “it melts”. The sweetly glazed skin is a sticky, chewy wonder. The grills are pork or chicken souvlaki, or a whole sea bream, the silvery skin blistered and blackened and then laid with chopped white onion and fresh green herbs. Both dishes come with a slightly sweet heap of rice, rendered a light earthy brown courtesy of cinnamon and other spice. Dessert comes in the shape of rugged pieces of baklava, the thick layers of syrup-drenched baked filo enclosing the requisite fillings. While we are told that has been brought in from elsewhere, there is also a tiramisu, assembled on site from cheery slices of sponge and whipped cream. If you make it to these and finish them, well done. I salute you. Like everything else, the wine list is a compact collection, just half a dozen whites and reds, with two-thirds of the list priced at £30 or less. There’s also a very short list of Greek wines, by which I mean three, some of which cost a little more. But it’s all relative isn’t it? For £28.50 a head you can simply order a meze, of starters and charcoal grills, delivered over five courses, and for parties of eight or more that’s all they’ll do. It strikes me as a very good option. It’s not as if you’ll miss out on anything. Some people will now be rabidly screaming at this review, because they will feel I have given away their “secret”. They will think I have made it harder for them to get a table. In truth, it should be hard to get a table here, because it’s just so damn lovely. And anyway, journalists aren’t in the business of keeping secrets. We’re in the business of telling you things you ought to know. Tsiakkos &amp; Charcoal is one of them. News bites Chef Robbie Lorraine has found a permanent site for his restaurant Only Food and Courses, a jolly take on food nostalgia from the 80s and 90s, which I enjoyed so much when it was operating out of a shipping container at Pop Brixton. It will now be inside the venerable Cheshire Cheese pub on London’s Fleet Street. Downstairs he’ll serve various snacks, while upstairs it will be a six-course ‘supper club’ menu in two sittings at £75 a head, including his take on smoked salmon and eggs, prawn cocktail and millionaires’ shortbread (onlyfoodandcourses.com). England has won the World Cup. In this case it was the Culinary World Cup, an event held every four years and which this time took place in Luxembourg. The nine-strong England squad took the gold medal ahead of 29 other countries, for their performance serving 110 covers in the Restaurant of the Nations event. They also took silver for their buffet, while the junior team took both a bronze and a silver. This is the kind of competition I can get behind. Margate restaurant Barletta, which set up a crowdfunder to help the business survive being defrauded out of £50,000, is to close. Announcing the decision on Instagram, they said ‘The impact of fraudulent activity on our bank account, compounded by the increase in energy bills and cost of living crisis has made it impossible for us to carry on. This was not the outcome we were hoping for, but it is the one we must make.’ Those who donated to the crowdfunder can request a refund. Anything left over will go to Hospitality Action.

Perhaps, like me, you’ve got as far as Brighton and then, distracted by bright lights and candyfloss, never travelled farther. I suspect that’s exactly how the locals like it, slightly ignored by the brouhaha of tourists requiring toffee apples or venues to scream in while wearing hen-night sashes. Lewes is not like this: it is a different land entirely, quaint, quirky, charming and all sorts of other words that make you loiter wistfully by estate agents’ windows, after visiting Anne of Cleves House and buying some beans from Trading Post Coffee Roasters. Until recently, the rumours were that the local restaurant landscape was a little limited, even if new Turkish place Zorba has breathed life into the town. Others told me to check out the new, superhip Relais Cooden Beach hotel revamp going on at nearby Bexhill-on-Sea, where I went pre-Fork, hoping for Sunday brunch like the cool cats order, but was begrudgingly served an untoasted ciabatta sandwich with a ready-salted crisp garnish at 10.30am, because the chef was no longer doing breakfast. By the time I reached Fork, my hunger was high and expectations thwarted. Luckily, it was worth saving my appetite for. Fork is small and intimate, and set in a Grade II-listed building and painted pale grey. Do not come here conducting a sordid affair and expect the adjacent tables not to hear every word of your chat; your neighbour’s elbows may well be in your soup. The room is sparse, with an open kitchen down one side, and there’s a walled garden to eat in during sunny months. This is a chef-led independent restaurant with modern aspirations: it’s fancy and imaginative, rather than hearty. The Sunday menu when we visited was two courses for £30 or three for £38. On the starters was a quenelle of rich chicken liver paté on sweet, moist, home-baked brioche with deep-fried gherkins, quince jelly and a scattering of pistachio. A dish such as this sets out a restaurant’s stall immediately: think the Ledbury and absolutely not Toby Carvery. Every element of this bowl is made from scratch and pondered over, including the placement of the micro cress and pea shoots. The same goes for my favourite dish of the day, if not the month so far: Fork’s cauliflower velouté, which sounds as if it might be a humble soup, but is in fact sating and complex. It has a hint of the cruciferous, but is rich with blue cheese and hazelnuts, and is topped with small, slightly sweet beignets – a posh word for tiny doughnuts that eradicates all their calories. This is the sort of place I dearly want to succeed, and times are perilous right now for restaurants, so if you can support places such as Fork, please show willing. My feeling is that Pizza Express and the big beasts will weather the coming storm, while chefs who devote hours to duck-fat rösti to perch beside organic sirloin, or make individual lobster wonton to complement day-boat fish for only a handful of customers, will find things much harder. Use them or lose them will be the theme of winter 2022-23, as we look to our high streets and wonder which restaurants might have the radiators on, so we might save a few hours of gas. I can think of worse ways to spend January than eating Fork’s glorious chocolate dessert, or, for that matter, the cunningly plain-seeming vanilla brulee, which, on prodding, gives way to a delicious pear compote and comes with a very good spicy ginger ice-cream. Presently, Fork is offering a Christmas menu where this ice-cream is now served with baked alaska and a mont blanc with chestnut ice-cream. They don’t do anything as upfront as turkey with the trimmings, but seasonal nods are there in cheesecake with calvados-poached apples and in a first course of confit duck pastilla with fig and spiced apricot chutney. Fork is a small, neighbourhood restaurant with a heart that is bursting with ambition. The team are enthusiastic and just the right level of earnest, and the clientele are locals, probably hoping that a restaurant critic doesn’t pitch up and enjoy a cauliflower velouté so much that she blows their secret. It is with some sheepishness, then, that I must do exactly that: if you’ve got as far as Brighton, then blow right through, head to Lewes and have dinner at Fork. Fork 14 Station Street, Lewes, East Sussex, 01273 809445. Open Tue–Sun, lunch noon–2.30pm (3.30pm Sun), dinner 6–9.30pm. Two courses £30, three £38, both plus drinks and service.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(37,'2022-08-12T11:00:10Z','Tatale, London SE1: ‘Elegant, but defiantly homespun’ - restaurant review | Grace Dent on restaurants','Tatale, a new pan-African restaurant, arrives on the London dining scene at a time when it cannot help but make competitors feel slightly drab. Recent flash new openings in the capital have taken a familiar shape: posh pub revamps serving salt marsh lamb at almost £35 a pop, pricey patisserie by famous international chefs and 100-plus-cover, all-day brasseries that look alluring in the PR photos, but offer a menu so drab, you’ll be snoring into your chicken paillard salad like the dormouse at the Mad Hatter’s tea party. Meanwhile, on the sidelines and making plans, was Akwasi Brenya-Mensa and his vision for Tatale, an upgrade of his popular supper club to a permanent home in the all-new Africa Centre in Southwark. His menus are broadly west African, but each dish is heavily redolent of a childhood in south London, travels in Israel and South Africa, and family trips to Ghana. So expect crisp, hot, panko-wrapped ackee croquettes, zinging with citrus and a scotch bonnet kick, as well as the silkiest, black-eyed bean hummus with red palm oil and a dukkah base note influenced by time spent in Tel Aviv, and served with crunchy plantain chips. This is very good, life-changing hummus. Brenya-Mensa also celebrates the casual joys of the Ghanaian roadside “chop bar” with a simple bowl of his mother’s “red red” black-eyed bean stew served with a whole, baked, edible flower-strewn plantain perched in the centre of the bowl. It’s a west African recipe with a modern twist, and delivered with a staunch, sentimental accuracy. Brenya-Mensa, who trained under James Cochran at 12:51, is patently not the first or only chef in south-east of England to offer plantain, ackee or chichinga chicken. However, vast, expensively hewn, pan-African new openings with magnificent art installations, bespoke furnishings and a separate cocktail bar are certainly slim on the ground. The walls are deep indigo, and the chairs and sofas vividly patterned in traditional Ghanian styles by Golden Editions, which specialises in kente cloth made in the Volta region. Tola Ojuolape Studio, meanwhile, has come up with a landscape of clay, terracotta and woven items to create a relaxed, communal space where visitors to the Africa Centre can come and go or take a table by the open kitchen. Brenya-Mensa has cited the arrival of restaurants such as the much-loved Chuku’s in Tottenham as giving him impetus, but Tatale is a different and much bigger beast altogether. Neither is it very much like the boldly experimental Ikoyi in St James or the highly likable Akoko in Fitzrovia, both of which offer ornate tasting menus and far heftier bills. Tatale is elegant, but defiantly homespun. The menu is unabashedly personal, with each dish coming with its own anecdote on the menu. Brenya-Mensa tells of working with a dance school in Tel Aviv, and of his family’s lively parties on a jaunt to Cape Town. There’s a nod towards what his mother makes him each Tuesday after football, namely that “red red” stew with the plantain, which on the day I visited was the only large plate on offer. It is rich and tomato-based, and laden with fermented locust bean and gari. I regret not being able to finish the bowl, because I went rather heavy on the yellow rice, or geelrys, a Malay-influenced, sunset-coloured bowl of sticky jasmine rice with fried shallots and lots of sultanas. Great rice is my downfall every time, and this sweet, compelling stuff is much more than your average side. The absolute star of the show, though, was the omo tuo in a delicious puddle of nkatenkwan. This bowl of rich, beautifully fiery groundnut soup with a dainty slick of vibrant green parsley oil sneaks up on you, becoming more fantastic each time you break off some of the mashed white rice dumpling from the centre, soak it in the nutty sauce and deliver it to your mouth. These dishes are painstakingly precise and are almost all vegan. Yes, there’s the much-talked-about chichinga buttermilk chicken, served as chicken wings with a side of dark red, fishy shito, but if you ignore that, this is a quietly plant-based menu, and definitely one for meat-avoiders to have up their sleeve. We went for Sunday lunch and ate our way through the entire list, leaving no room for the chin chin cheesecake, which was such a rookie mistake: I should probably hand back my badge. I saw it going to other tables, though – crunchy, broken pieces of glistening fried dough perched on lightly whipped cream cheese, apple and lime zest – so I have no choice but to slink back alone one day. Brenya-Mensa has created one of London’s most interesting and delicious new openings, and it’s no wonder he’s been called an “African futurist”. My future, I hope, involves much more nkatenkwan.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(38,'2022-11-04T12:00:43Z','mu, London E8: ‘Very decent, experimental Japanese with a side of jazz'' – restaurant review | Grace Dent on restaurants','Mu, like most noteworthy restaurants, will polarise guests from the moment they walk in. Some will feel glee that it’s named after the album mu by jazz trumpeter Don Cherry, and that a small fee will be added to your bill to pay the pianist or singer who’ll begin at about 7.30pm. Others will say, “Why are you leading me into a graffiti-strewn building to eat Japanese-influenced food in a dark jazz club? Was Cafe Rouge fully booked?” That latter group may well find mu quite the experience. As I perused the menu while Dawn Mist by Freddie Redd played over the sound system at the same time as pianist Yohan Kebede of Kokoroko was warming up for his night’s set, I thought of several friends for whom this would be a little pocket of heaven. It is a project by brothers Amit and Aneesh Patel, who also run Brilliant Corners in nearby Dalston and are behind the travelling club/sound system Giant Steps, but at mu the food is taken seriously, too. It would be tempting at a venue such as this merely to bash out a menu of dull skewers, spring rolls and sliders, and hope that the audience is too lost in music to care. But no: mu is a very decent, experimental Japanese restaurant with a charcoal robatayaki grill that serves up the likes of nikiri-glazed tofu with daikon salad and hake tempura with wasabi and peas. Both those dishes are good examples of mu’s reach towards high standards. The tofu comes in a generous, almost scorched block brushed heavily with a sweet soy more commonly used on fish, and alongside a pretty but substantial slaw of daikon and carrot in a rice-vinegar wafu dressing. This is not a flimsy vegetarian option; it is smoky, assertive and decidedly robust. The hake, meanwhile, is a large sharing portion of white fish in an exquisitely light batter, served with mushy peas that have a feisty wasabi undercurrent. It is the missing link between Ormskirk and Osaka. Someone, somewhere, has really thought about this stuff. Forgive me for sounding surprised, but I have frequented many, many music venues over the decades, and not once have I woken up the next day extolling the postmodern playfulness of the chef’s vision. How it feels to eat here when the place is packed to the rafters for a roaring late Friday night jazz performance, I can only guess, because I went on a sedate, midweek evening when the large horseshoe bar was serving its cocktail menu of old classics to a few quietly spoken drinkers and a handful of the pianist’s fans. In these circumstances, mu felt much more like an actual restaurant, albeit a rather capacious and draughty one. We made our way through the brief, but memorable menu, eating a very good, earthy tennis ball of beef tartare with strips of dark green nori to smear it on. Yellowtail sashimi with yuzu and pomegranate was fresh and appealing, while a slightly less fabulous aubergine, grilled until blackened but with squidgy innards seeping with white miso, still vanished quickly. That same powerful grill will sear you a Dexter striploin topped with caviar, or scallop skewers smeared with yuzu koscho, that magical chilli paste that lifts fish, noodles and even cakes to higher levels. A side of baby gem doused in miso and thickly carpeted with panko breadcrumbs made a mockery of that leaf as a salad item, transforming it into something rich, sweet and more like pudding. The only bum note was a dry, drab bowl of shoestring fries flecked with green that purported to be nori fries but were so nondescript and incompatible with the rest of dinner that it was as if they came from a different kitchen. Mu serves one dessert only: creme brulee. My sworn policy is never to eat pudding at any restaurant that offers just one option, because they patently want to put you off the idea altogether; it’s a sugar-spun sort of Jedi mind trickery that lots of restaurants are doing right now, rather than employing a decent pastry chef. And custard wot has been blowtorched is no one’s idea of an interesting pudding; it’s what MasterChef contestants make for a speedy second course after frittering 90 minutes doing pork five ways. I can, however, forgive mu for this. The food at this charming, bold, cool, music venue, which is really trying to give young talent and well-loved but niche artists a platform, is far grander and ornately executed than it needs to be. They are not busking through the menu. This is a kitchen playing confidently. I’m not the hugest jazz fan, but I know what I know about dinner, and I’m definitely ready for a second performance. mu 432-434 Kingsland Road, London E8, 020-7209 4187.

All dishes £5.30-£18, desserts £5.80-£9.30, wines from £23 a bottle Some dishes are as distinct as the cook’s fingerprints. At Pascor on London’s Kensington High Street, that dish is a mini loaf of challah, platted and plump, golden-glazed and sesame-sprinkled. It is served warm from the oven, alongside a dish of smoked tahini the colour of iron filings, and a scoop of whipped za’atar butter. When you tear into it, you are greeted by an ineffably light, white crumb, puffing sweet, steamy gusts of baked joy at you. The shape of this loaf may be different, but the Yemeni-style bread is exactly the same as that first served to me at the Palomar on Soho’s Rupert Street in 2014. There, the head chef, a delightful, stocky, beardy Israeli man called Tomer Amedi, would bang it out of the still-hot tin in front of you and then shout at you to get stuck in. I always did what Amedi told me to do, including, occasionally, a few shots of arak. The Palomar under Amedi was a louche, noisy party of a restaurant, especially if you were seated at the counter, where dishes – the Jerusalem Mix of chicken livers, hearts and thigh, or the harissa carrots with salted lemon and parsley or the tagines, many and various – weren’t so much served to you as flung enthusiastically in your general direction. After making his mark at the Palomar, a sibling to the famed Machneyuda in Jerusalem, Amedi returned to Israel. Now he is back here. Kind of. He is described as the executive chef at Pascor, a neighbourhood restaurant in the sort of neighbourhood where ownership of a mere BMW is a mark of failure. Which is what makes Pascor so striking. It’s reasonably priced, not just for this silk-knickered bit of Kensington High Street, but for both London in general and for this quality of cooking in particular. Many of the smaller plates are priced in single digits and the rest are in the low or mid-teens. The wine list opens at £23 a bottle. After eating there, I asked Amedi by email whether it will stay like this. I have been caught out by artificially low prices on opening menus before. He agreed they may go up a little; everything is becoming more expensive for restaurants, just as it is at home. But the pricing is part of the philosophy. “I want people to be able to come two to three times a month, instead of only for special occasions,” he said. Let’s take his word for it. It really does feel like a neighbourhood joint. The downstairs space is a narrow, high-ceilinged room with a big open kitchen, built around a grill and charcoal oven. It’s staffed by just two cooks tonight, schooled by Amedi, who is here for a few weeks at a time every couple of months. Just as at the Palomar that kitchen, led by head chef Meirelane Silva Passos, is knocking out Middle Eastern-accented dishes full of vigour and intent. What’s striking is the perfect balance of salt and acidity. A salad is described as a “reverse” tabbouleh, because there’s more foliage – lots of flat-leaf parsley, dill and baby spinach – than grains, in this case, puffed freekeh, made from roasted and polished durum wheat. It comes in an invigorating buttermilk dressing and is the edible equivalent of jump leads to the mouth. While there are meat options – charred lamb chops for example, or a curious-sounding “Egypt meets Vietnam” duck salad in a pomegranate and ginger dressing with dukka – it’s the garden section of the menu, led off by this salad, which drags me in. We have a whole aubergine, roasted until it is falling apart and smelling deeply of bonfire, or perhaps a trip round the back of the school bike sheds in the good old days. It comes dressed with pickled tomatoes, pine nuts and more of that steel-grey smoked tahini sauce. Then there are what they call their “ultra-crispy” potatoes. I’m really not going to argue with what could otherwise look like outrageous hyperbole. New potatoes have been boiled, then squished to become a geological mess of crag and crevice, before being deep fried. You might have taken them out of the fat a bit earlier. This kitchen has left them in, until they have turned the most inviting shade of golden brown. They come dusted in Yemeni spices and gratings of hard cheese and spritzed with salted lime. They lie on an earthy-coloured aioli, flavoured with smoked tomato. It’s a serious load of beguiling potato action for £8.20. From the seafood section come fat shell-on prawns in a cast-iron skillet filled with a tomato, harissa and salted lime sauce which, like the chef who came up with it, is simply demanding you have a bloody good time. After it’s placed on the table, a fiercely hot stone is added rather theatrically so that the sauce boils and starts to crust against the sides. We eat the prawns and suck the heads and scrape the skillet clean. If that dish is deep and powerful, a fillet of trout, with greens and coriander baked in an almond butter, is lightness and freshness itself. I am mildly concerned by the description of the salt-cured mackerel in another dish as “local”; the nearest body of water to here is either the Serpentine in Hyde Park or the Thames where it curves round at Putney. I don’t think either of those will have provided. Still, wherever it came from, the cure has given it a dense texture, set off by the roasted beetroot and the sprinkle of fresh red chilli. It’s a salty plateful, soothed by a dollop of labneh. The dessert offering is short and designed for ease of service. We have a fat scoop of chocolate and tahini mousse on a biscuit crumb, drizzled with a little berry sauce, and a glazed coconut and almond financier, which looks terribly elegant but has the comfortingly familiar crunch and chew of an old school macaroon. The only misstep, indeed of the whole meal, is the splodge of unsweetened ricotta that’s alongside. It needs more than just a dribble of honey to get it moving. For otherwise, love abounds here, across the bottle of crisp white wine from Portugal and the steaming fresh mint tea, served at the end in delicate porcelain of the sort Granny might have kept for best. Pascor is the Latin for to feast or devour, or so the internet tells me, because I never studied classics. It certainly describes what we did. Tomer, it’s great to have your food back in London. News bites It’s all change at Raymond Blanc’s Le Manoir. Gary Jones, who recently stepped down as executive head chef after more than two decades in the role, is to be replaced in January by Luke Selby, currently of Evelyn’s Table in London’s Soho. He will be joined at Le Manoir by his brothers Nathaniel and Theodore, who have been cooking alongside him at Evelyn’s Table since it launched in the cellar of the Blue Posts pub in 2020. Luke started his career as a commis chef at Le Manoir in 2009, and has also worked at Hide and Restaurant Gordon Ramsay. Chef Dave Mothersill, who has worked in some of Brighton’s best-known restaurants including the Salt Room, the Gingerman and Terre a Terre, is to open his first solo venture in the city. Furna, on New Road, will have just three dozen seats and will serve a decidedly upmarket tasting menu at £90 a head. Dishes will include mushroom agnolotti with black garlic, chestnuts and Wiltshire truffle, veal sweetbreads with kabocha, maple sherry and a roasted chicken sauce, and mirin meringues with clementines. Rockfish, the southwest-based seafood restaurant group, will be offering free children’s portions of fish and chips to all under 11s, when an accompanying adult orders a main course, between now and March 2023. “Our aim is simple,” founder and CEO Mitch Tonks has said. “To bring families together this winter to enjoy the amazing local, sustainable seafood on our doorstep.

Its inhabitants? Merely actors. Qantas? Fictitious. You could take the deniers down to Milk Beach, a new Australian restaurant in Soho, to meet the freckled, outdoorsy staff and savour the grilled shrimp, the lamingtons and the sheer Australian-ness of it all, yet they’d only say, “This is all very convenient, but where’s the proof?” That said, there is something about the distinct lightness of Milk Beach that presents Australia as some sort of idyllic dream world. One moment you’re on Greek Street, weaving through the bins, rats and hen parties, before a quick turn into an alleyway reveals the fresh and pretty Ilona Rose House. Here is Milk Beach, a spacious, pastel-and-pale-timber oasis helmed by calm, rested, beach-tousled staff who are seemingly just back from an afternoon ashtanga session on Bondi. Perhaps … Yes, life in the UK is cold, cruel and unyielding right now, but here at Milk Beach things are decidedly vitamin D-drenched and blissful, as if your biggest problem were overly sandy flip-flops or, at the very worst, the coffee and banana negronis not arriving swiftly enough. Restaurants are all about staging, and Milk Beach knocks it out of the park on that score. This is its second rendition, after the highly popular Queen’s Park restaurant that opened in north-west London in 2018 and quickly became known for its brunches serving the infantilising likes of soft-boiled eggs in a jar with sweet potato puree and soldiers, and Granny Elly’s banana bread with espresso cream cheese. The Soho menu is more of the same formula, a breezy flutter through Mediterranean and south-east Asian influences, but with Sydney swagger at its heart. The menu is divided into “nibbles”, “raw”, “veggies”, “plates” and “robata”. The raw section centres around oyster “shooters”, with gin bloody marys and Jersey rock oysters served with Thai cucumber consommé. There are also very good cured silver-skinned sardines with buttermilk, all dotted with lemon thyme and smoked sun-dried tomatoes and utterly delicious. Grilled baby gem is cropping up on a lot of menus right now, possibly because it’s inexpensive and, with the application of some cheffy ingenuity, can be so much more than the sum of its parts. Here, it comes with a rich, vibrant pistachio butter that turns it into something luscious and memorable. While the raw courses were rather delicate, things become substantial once you’re into the “veggies” and “plates” territory; in fact, they veer on the hearty. There was a fantastic, lightly tempura-coated Szechuan aubergine karaage in which half an eggplant was deep-fried, spiced and strewn with cashews. Life is too short to tempura your own aubergine and, let’s be frank, it would all end very badly, anyway. Very hungry people should choose the koji-marinated chicken “schnitty” (it’s just a schnitzel, so please excuse the “cute” nickname) with a good, feisty, fermented chilli mayonnaise, a generous, determinedly filling feast of breaded chicken and thick-cut chips. There’s also the diminutive-sounding prawn toast that turns out to be a fearsome, deeply sating chunk of white bloomer thickly caked in prawn goo and encrusted in sesame seeds. Stars of the show for me, however, were large prawns in a pool of pink, fermented chilli butter, lovingly prepared with their heads off, leaving you with just the plump flesh to scoop through that sauce and pop in your mouth. It was at this point that I realised that Milk Beach is really rather brilliant; not just a gimmicky brunch spot for people too wised up to join the queue for The Breakfast Club, and instead a living, breathing restaurant offering some of the most accomplished cooking I’ve seen in Soho for some time. British palates have never quite warmed to the lamington, that Australian favourite of chocolate-covered butter sponge rolled in desiccated coconut, but perhaps Milk Beach’s version will be the breakthrough moment, because here it’s been turned into a flouncy, whipped marshmallow, chocolate fondant, jammy, coconutty work of art; not a cake, but a bowl of pudding and easily enough to feed the two of us. The spirit of Australia, reworked in dishes, decor and spins on classics, will perhaps not be to everyone’s taste. As Ben says to Ollie in The Thick of It, “Australia: why would I want to go there? It’s full of people in khaki, squinting.” But on a dark October evening, the service is warm and toasty, and the shrimp, martinis and pseudo-sunshine are worth putting on your best formal board shorts for and heading down to the make-believe sea.

In Arcachon, dinner each night was unfussy yet always chic, because the French can’t help themselves. They can sling 10 large prawns at a plate and serve them with cold Orangina and still make a woman feel like Brigitte Bardot. Turbot was served whole, grilled, face glaring, with a bowl of fried baby potatoes and baskets of fresh bread with copious salted butter. Dessert was a scoop of homemade glace, or maybe two if you were feeling a little extra. Simple dining is where the joy of eating is truly revealed. Then, bang: it’s back to Saturday night in central London, for a dinner by Carlo Scotto, who has quietly and painstakingly revealed himself over the past few years as one of Britain’s most imaginative chefs. This Italian chef has flown slightly under the radar. His previous venture, Xier, in my opinion, had all the cut-and-thrust of a two-star Michelin restaurant, despite not winning even one. I remember a succession of tiny plates of beurre noisette gnocchi swimming in warm kombu tea, then half a single arancino on a sticky, kohlrabi jus, then stracciatella with dehydrated wild strawberries. Scotto is one of the new crown princes of the fancy, finickety, finest dining scene. Xier was easily as impressive as the likes of Core by Clare Smyth or even Le Gavroche. I sent numerous people there who needed places to impress dates, get engaged or spend a client’s money – although clearly not enough people, because Xier has since closed. Now, though, Amethyst is here, named after Scotto’s birthstone, and serving a very long, 12-course tasting menu or, for people paying babysitters, a shorter, six-course one in a dining room that has a slight air of the bridge on the Starship Enterprise. Before an open kitchen, an enormous, communal zigzag table dominates the room. Apparently, this allows customers to eat together while also eating privately, with the option of watching the chefs at work. Enforced communal dining with strangers is not really my bag, but then I am still deeply scarred by an eco-glamping trip in 2011, when every night was a laborious session of peapod-burgundy-fuelled oneupmanship and moans about the sawdust toilet. For the more antisocial among us, you can also eat in the dimly lit but lovely wine cellar. Let me make no bones about this: dinner at Amethyst is not cheap. Six courses at £90 without booze came in at about £140 for one person, including service; a glass of zero-alcohol wine was £14 and a mocktail of fruit juice just short of a tenner. Scotto’s skills, however, have gone from strength to strength since Xier; Amethyst is certainly one of the UK’s best restaurants, whatever any lists that emerge during 2022/2023 may tell you. From the initial course of a small, glossy, Moroccan-style briouat stuffed with a dark, fragrant stew of nettle and almond, then made sweet with a baharat honey glaze, we were entranced. That was followed by a plump, unforgettable croquette filled with liquorice, tarragon and parmesan, followed by a signature dish of salmon marinated in rose petal with sharp bursts of yuzu and the crunch of Piedmont hazelnuts. Next, a single, heartbreakingly good gyoza stuffed with melting braised aubergine in a myoga tea and sake broth. Then, a dish of black cod, resembling a lump of coal while retaining its soft, yielding texture, scented with burnt hay and caramelised miso, followed by the finest Dexter beef with ras el hanout and beetroot sauce, with an intricately grilled and sesame-seed-encrusted medjool date. After a “palate cleanser” of sorbet, which was nothing of the sort – Amalfi lemon and violet liqueur together could probably rouse the dead – we finished with a peach poached in amaro Montenegro, served with a vibrant, green, herb sorbet. The server had warned us we were going “on a journey” through Scotto’s experience and influences; she wasn’t lying. Amethyst was a whistlestop tour of Nordic and Japanese cuisine with French and Arabic influences, served seriously and never, ever simply, but with enough fun to keep things lovable. There are no baskets of bread, casually strewn crevettes or cheap and cheerful vin rouge here, but if you’re in the mood to be fancy, I can’t think of anywhere new that is better. Amethyst 6 Sackville Street, London W1, 020-3034 3464. Open Tues-Sat, lunch noon-2pm, dinner 6-8.30pm. Six-course menu £90, 12-course £135 (chef’s table experience £150), all plus drinks and service.

Unfashionable, then cool again, then once more déclassé and, at one point in very recent history, even prohibited. At Aroma Buffet in west London, however – in a shopping centre, up an escalator, next to a Wetherspoons – the vast, lunchtime buffet of noodles, stir-fries and plentiful cakes, puddings and ice-cream is a pleasing £15. The buffet’s timing in returning to modern life is impeccable, delivering joy through dark times and ransacked wallets. The price for dinner is £22, where children under 150cm can eat for £11. Any person with a thrifty parent who has ever been smuggled in a car boot into a safari park will know such rules are made for testing. Aroma’s head chef swears to me that Marco Pierre White has been in and, at these prices, he’d be a berk not to. For an all-you-can-eat next to a Lidl, I think even a food snob could find two, three or more plates of something they really liked. Of a Thursday lunchtime, there is a department store leaving do, a few new mums, one birthday party, and many couples and solo diners. The open kitchen is hectic, and no wonder with 70 or so dishes on offer; the dinner menu is even more extensive. Aroma started out serving Cantonese-style crowdpleasers – sticky, black-bean sauces, piles of chow mein and battered pork in sunset-orange sweet-and-sour – but these days it calls itself pan-Asian, shape-shifting in line with the modern British palate. So there are now West Sumatran rendangs and Indonesian nasi goreng, and coconut-based Malaysian stew sits close to a Japanese teppanyaki grill selection. There are freshly made maki, California and dragon rolls. The fried, rolled ice-cream, which you can lace with KitKat, Oreo, fresh banana and so on, is a big deal in Thailand. Look closely among all the trays of vegetable tempura and platters of Peking duck with pancakes, and you’ll also find margarita pizza, chicken nuggets and, of course, chips. So, more pan-world than pan-Asian, but I defy any hungry person to leave without some of their whims catered to. If I sound oddly jubilant about eating limitless Singapore noodles in a shopping centre, it’s possibly because I’ve spent months watching restaurant prices rocket to grimly comedic levels. Lunch here costs less than a side of boujie patatas bravas I had recently at a much-admired Bloomsbury restaurant. The KitKat rolled ice-cream, a new experience for me, is especially delicious as it glides down the throat in thin sheets, coating the mouth and tastebuds in a way that normal ice-cream does not. See me for theories on why Easter egg chocolate tastes more chocolatey than chunks from a bar. It’s all about surfaces. Aroma is also unafraid of heat, spice and feisty flavours, which often get lost in mass-catering ventures, and the likes of its salt-and-pepper tofu and spicy chilli beef are memorably punchy. Each tray appears with the earnestness of chefs delivering their very best according to what cost and time allow, and all while working out when to replace steaming vats of lo mein or char siu, so there’s always enough, but never too much. Simultaneously, all new customers shouldn’t feel as if they’re rifling through the leftovers at the end of a party, and the floor staff are constantly wiping, replenishing spoons and rearranging dishes to make the party feel as if it’s always just beginning. Waste is a major issue with buffets, but Aroma has that covered, too, having signed up for the Too Good To Go food scheme that means, at the end of each service, a set number of diners are allowed to load up boxes of whatever’s left for a fraction of the usual price. Titter you might, because this is not L’Enclume, but one day buffets may be the only restaurants we have left. There are many ways to approach a buffet. Some diners load their plates as if this were their last chance of eating on Earth, or more likely out of concern that, if they take just two rather than 10 teppanyaki prawns, the supply will run out. Personally, I see plate one as a trial run. I like to gather a small sample of the most alluring, unmissable protein-based items – in this case, beef rendang, some black bean chicken and a few dumplings – in a bid to form a cogent plan for plates two through to seven. After all, it’s a rookie error to go heavy on carbohydrates in plates one to three, even if Aroma’s Singapore noodles are exactly as I love them: fatty, spicy, thin strands laden with egg, pork, chicken, pepper and chilli. By bowl four, however, you can safely commit to unstructured bowls of nasi goreng with a side of spicy prawn maki and a large plate of red velvet cupcakes. The rule at Aroma is that there are no rules. Well, not many: if you turn up, crouch over and pretend to be a child who is smaller than 150cm high, you will be asked to leave immediately.

Most dishes £8-£12, sharing platters £12-£30. Unlicensed The late, great foreign correspondent Nicholas Tomalin famously once said that, to achieve success in journalism, you needed “rat-like cunning, a plausible manner and a little literary ability”. Restaurant critics need a few other qualities: a rapacious appetite, broad tastes and a serviceable set of teeth. The latter have been a little challenging of late. Recently, on a trip to see my dentist to discuss a front crown that keeps unbonding, he told me he had taken to reading my reviews with trepidation. “I was certain one thing you ordered was going to take that tooth out,” he said. I thought about my dentist when our first dish landed at the tiny Chinese café, Roasta Preston. It was a heaped platter of duck wings, duck necks and duck gizzards for £13. The obscure corners and extremities of the duck, too often the parts left behind, are offered here in a variety of styles: braised, spicy fried or, the one we had chosen, lightly battered and deep-fried with minced garlic, salt and pepper. If anything was going to dislodge a crown it had to be these. This plateful was a bunting-strewn festival of hands-on nibblage and tooth tugging, of crisped skin and meat dragged in ribbons from the bone, interspersed with the occasional dense nugget of bronzed gizzard, chopsticked from the plate. It was delightfully compulsive. It was engrossing. And happily, Mr Sharma, it wasn’t dentally challenging. A couple of weeks ago I made much of Kushi-Ya in Nottingham not being a hidden gem, just somewhere I hadn’t heard of before, which is not the same thing. I do, however, regard Roasta as a bit of a find, not least because of how I found it. With a spare lunch in Preston I went looking for possibilities. That high-end place predictably doing tasting menus I didn’t have the energy to sit through, wasn’t in any case open on a Tuesday lunchtime. I brought up a Google map of the city and put the word “restaurant” in the search bar, then clicked on literally every red knife and fork across that map that wasn’t attached to a Nando’s or Turtle Bay. I found Roasta outside the city centre on the corner of a residential shopping parade, just past the Central Lancashire University campus, which doubtless provides much of its custom. Normally, I treat gushing online user reviews with caution, as though they are potentially infected with anthrax until proven otherwise. But there was a warm unanimity to these, complete with repeated assertions that the food here recalled the very best places in Hong Kong, written by people who sounded like they knew their stuff. This makes sense. Roasta was opened five years ago by Fai Tsang and her husband, Wai, who are indeed from Hong Kong. She runs the tiny 20-seater dining room and he is in the kitchen. At the heart of the menu are Cantonese meat dishes to share: a whole roast duck for £30, a whole soy-marinated chicken for £25. We have the duo meat platter, for £15. The duck, offered off or on the bone, is a very solid example, its shimmering, lacquered skin cracking beneath the teeth. The roast pork belly is simply magnificent. Almost all the fat has been rendered away and the salty crackling has become a golden savoury honeycomb that first crunches and then seems to melt away. We are given dishes of plum sauce and soy to dip it into, and do so with something close to reverence. Alongside this, creamy white Chinese leaf, fried in a dark vinegar sauce with caramel tones beneath the acidity, becomes a perfect dancing partner. Most of the menu is made up of ingredients offered in a variety of ways for around £10 a go. You can have boneless chicken thigh or pork in, say, black bean sauce or with pickled cabbage, in satay sauce or fried and coated with salted egg and so on. Dry-fried green beans with minced pork are offered with garlic, preserved olives or, as we have them, with black beans. It’s a hilarious turbo charge to an already flavour-boosted dish. Finally, we have squeakily fresh prawns, sliced at the back and curled in on themselves like fat commas, in a broth thick with cracked black pepper and glugs of Shaoxing wine. Of course, you can have rice, or their own hand-pulled noodles in broth or a variety of Guilin-style rice noodles, but I always worry a ballast of carbs will get in the way of the stuff I’m really interested in. I tell them I’ll have rice at the end if I’m still hungry. I don’t order rice. Roasta is unlicensed, but the food is giving me enough of a high. I pass on the bubble tea option; I just don’t get the appeal of those wobbly tapioca balls. Instead, I drink jasmine tea poured from a constantly refilled teapot into a thimble-sized enamel mug. Roasta very much falls into the column marked café rather than restaurant; perhaps, to salami slice the definitions, into that noble column marked “caff”. It is an elbows-on-the-table sort of place, where you could hunker down by yourself over a bowl of something steaming and delicious that makes the world better, and all at an extremely good price. But the menu deserves to be fully explored. It takes you far beyond comfort food and into a whole bunch of the Cantonese tradition’s intriguing ginnels, to use a Lancashire-appropriate word. Leave the plastic at home; they only accept cash. We have over ordered for two, and settle a bill for £56. My virtual journey across the Preston map, one excitable click at a time, also led me, that evening, to the sweetly accommodating Bar Pintxos, off Fishergate in the centre of town. I got in just before the kitchen closed for a great value bottle of albariño and a few plates of very agreeable tapas: more fat prawns, but this time pil pil, in a thick garlicky sauce, some padrón peppers, crunchy calamari with a saffron aioli and chorizo, offered in either cider or sherry depending on your taste. At the end came a slab of baked Basque cheesecake. There’s a lot of this about at the moment. All too often it can be heavy and mouth-clogging. This was light and creamy and eminently finishable. With it came a glass of Pedro Ximénez sherry, smelling wistfully of Christmas. It was a very good end to a lovely day. Oh and praise be, the tooth held. I think it’s safe for now. News bites The Nigerian-born chef Adejoké ‘Joké’ Bakare has closed her acclaimed West African restaurant Chishuru in Brixton, south London, ahead of reopening elsewhere in the capital next year. The 34-seat restaurant, which started as a supper club, has simply outgrown its current space, Bakare has said. While she needs more space, she has promised that Chishuru will remain true to its casual roots. ‘Yes, the new restaurant will be nice and shiny, but not too shiny,’ she told restaurant industry website Big Hospitality. The acclaimed movie Boiling Point, set in a restaurant during one difficult service and apparently filmed in a single shot, has spawned a six-part TV series for BBC One. The show will pick up six months after the events of the film and will focus on Carly, the sous chef, played by Vinette Robinson, as she becomes head chef of her own restaurant. Stephen Graham, who played the wired head chef Andy in the original, will reprise his character. Filming is due to begin early next year. Farewell to the great chef Joyce Molyneux who has died aged 91. Early in her career she worked with George Perry-Smith at the Hole in the Wall in Bath before making her name at the Carved Angel in Dartmouth, where she headed up the kitchen from 1974, eventually winning a Michelin star. Chef Bruce Poole of Chez Bruce described her as ‘a true titan of British cooks’. In 2017, Molyneux was given the Lifetime Achievement award by the OFM Awards.

We’ll see much of this over the coming years. The British didn’t fall out of love with the sights, sounds or shapes of their locals, but aimless boozing has certainly lost a place in our lives. “Eating is cheating” was the battle-cry of the 1990s barfly, which sounds so quaintly debauched today, when eating is the glue that bonds us and now, more than ever, the kitchen profits are keeping the lights on. At the Tamil Prince (which used to be The Cuckoo), the bar is still intact and serving pints of, among others, Purity, Harbour and no-alcohol Lucky Saint, but they’ve painted the place a glorious, comforting shade of Farrow &amp; Ball Studio Green, and turned it into a rather sleek, unofficial, south Indian reincarnation of the wildly admired Malaysian/Singaporean street-food joint Roti King. Prince Durairaj, the one-time executive chef at Roti King, is now creating joyful vibes midway up the Caledonian Road, offering flaky, soft, luscious rotis that are heavenly proof that God’s chosen carbohydrate is bread. If you’ve never heard of Roti King, it began life in a basement opposite a side entrance to Euston station and has since spread its toes into other locations and food halls across London, and this no-frills cafe has long been a favourite with food obsessives, commuters and hungry students. So much so that it’s wildly oversubscribed, perilously addictive and the queue starts building at 11am every morning. I’ve been known, after a month in the spice-starved Lake District, to get off the Avanti West Coast, trundle my suitcase from platform 13 and join the wait for a restorative roti canai. Durairaj, who hails from Tamil Nadu, has found more genteel surroundings for his takes on dal makhani and paneer butter masala. He has built this vision with Glen Leeson, ex of the slick dining conglomerate JKS, while the cocktails are by Simone Pugi from Soho’s Bar Termini, which is where top bartenders spend their Mondays off. So, the Tamil Prince was never going to be just another dilapidated pub flinging out microwaved bhunas and pilaus – which I say with no disrespect to Curry Club Thursdays at Wetherspoons, my father’s favourite restaurant, but not once have I ever felt prompted to find the chef there and shake his hand over the deft spicing of his prawns. Instead, the Tamil Prince is firing out a menu of a similar standard to the likes of Gymkhana in Mayfair. Intensely seasoned grilled tiger prawns are so huge that they resemble a frightening alien task force, and are followed by channa bhatura, a giant’s pillow of deep-fried dough with a satisfying chickpea curry. In fact, about half of the short yet meaningful menu is vegetarian and focuses on delicious things primarily from Durairaj’s home state, and it’s divided into the inevitable small plates and a few larger offerings. Bowls of crisp, delicately seasoned fried okra give way to spiced chicken lollipops with sweet homemade chutney to sweep them through. My favourite among the smaller dishes was the pulled beef masala uttapum, a thick, soft, spongy dosa that reminded me a bit of a drop scone flavoured with shredded meat. It was served with a brutally delicious chilli coconut chutney that slips into your mouth like balm, then transforms into something incredibly punchy, yet still compels you to devour the entire pot. In many Indian restaurants, it may feel a shame to waste your appetite on the humble onion bhaji, but at the Tamil Prince, it’s worth the risk, because they’re gorgeous, feathery-light and come with a vibrant mint chutney to complement their allium tones. We ate paneer butter masala, dunking our rotis into its sweet, pungent, crimson sauce, before moving the rest back and forth through vats of decent Thanjavur chicken curry and a dark, creamy dal makhani, which, for a lentil lover, was sheer happiness. In short, the Tamil Prince is just plain great. It’s dog-friendly, and the cocktails are imaginative and redolent of cardamom, rose water and lime. The staff are upbeat and didn’t flinch when I appeared at opening time, at the same time as the delivery vans, to cadge a table for two. Nor did they tut when, moments after starting to eat, I realised that two rotis would never be enough for all these delectable sauces and that I’d need extra immediately. Desi pubs have, of course, been around for years, yet this is a sharp, bold reworking of the concept into the here and now. In the current climate, the desi pub may just be what the industry needs.

It is ruggedly pretty, blustery even in summer and has 165 miles of coastline to pooter along, eating cullen skink, stovies and fish fresh from Peterhead. From the seawalls at Footdee, you can eat one of those fearsome lard croissants called butteries (or rowies), spread thickly with jam, while staring appreciatively at a trawler in the North Sea simply for breaking up the unending, shimmery nothingness. If you begin your trip in Aberdeen, you’d be hard-pressed to find a more coastal dining experience than The Silver Darling, because it’s right on Pocra Quay, inside the old customs house. The quaint, cobbled harbour was first registered as a business in 1136 under King David I, and the customs house would never have won any beauty contests; it was made to survive, hewn from granite with a flat roof and a panoramic view of all the ships and boats approaching. There’s a sense from the moment you enter, passing the grand private dining room and up the stairs to the restaurant proper, that these walls have heard their fair share of gossip. Even if, nowadays, it’s the sort of charming place Dame Judi Dench stops off at on her way back from the Braemar Games, to dine on cumin and coriander-spiced monkfish, battered oysters and crispy Szechuan squid. Times certainly change, especially for the herring, after which the restaurant is named: “silver darling” is an old nickname for these fish, back when they were consumed by the ton and revered for keeping fishing families financially afloat. Cut to 2022, however, and the poor herring can’t even find a starring role on the Silver Darling’s menu out of sentimentality. It’s there, in rollmop form and in very small letters, at the bottom of the £40 mixed platter menu, under the more glamorous-sounding mussels marinière, gravadlax and crevettes, but if you opt for the posher, £75 “full house” platter featuring the likes of a langoustine bisque “espresso”, you won’t have to face a herring at all. The Silver Darling is one of those restaurants that will always attract guests simply for the view, so be clear when booking that you want a seat by the window. If you’re not bothered about seeing the sea, however, there is more exciting cooking happening inland at Café 52, which I swear by. Still, this is an affable way to spend time on a cold, rain-battered day with a bowl of fancy cullen skink made with local haddock, toasted oats and chives. Or, when the sun shines, take a seat looking out over the beach and knock back Loch Fyne rock oysters with red wine shallot vinegar while drinking glasses of the house white, Il Barroccio Bianco. Oysters are an acquired taste for many, so if slimy things aren’t your bag, the beer-battered Cape Wrath ones here might be where you have an epiphany. Battering and deep-frying makes oysters spongier and more subtle, and gives them a lovely, portobello mushroom mouthfeel, and they’re wonderful dipped in homemade sweet chilli sauce or seaweed mayonnaise. Next, a plate of nicely seared Shetland scallops with a dainty salad of pickled samphire and fennel laced with sea buckthorn gel. Roast Stonehaven langoustines with garlic and lemon butter are simple yet delicious. We chose the North Sea jumbo haddock with hand-cut chips and crushed peas, which, like all posh fish and chips, lost some of its charm in the bid to be posh. Still, the batter was delicate and light and the fish nicely pale and flaky. The haddock was certainly jumbo. I chipped away at mine for what felt like an hour, making little impact on the beast, and finished off two pots of delicious, caper-laden tartare sauce in the process. It should be said, the menu isn’t completely fishy: there are Scottish sirloin steaks, chana masala vegan burgers and kale linguine, if that floats your day boat, but really this is a place to celebrate the sea. Don’t trust me, trust Rod Stewart: his face is on the wall looking ecstatic. The pudding menu features a sea buckthorn creme brulee, but the dish that would make me pine for land if I was ever away on an oil rig would be the warm triple-chocolate espresso-and-pecan-nut brownie with PX ice-cream, festooned with crystallised pecan nuts. Never has a pastry chef rammed so many of my favourite vices in one bowl concurrently. There’s also a bramble crumble with rosemary ice-cream that feels more homespun and in keeping with the humble ancestors who worked here and never tasted a caramelised banana bavarois with pineapple glaze. This port is ancient, mighty and will live on longer than all of us; the Silver Darling is a pleasant way to stop by and pay tribute. The Silver Darling Pocra Quay, Aberdeen, 01224 576229.

In the noughties, it was synonymous with the vanishing of old-fashioned, often cherished things: printed menus, affordable burgers, sticky carpets and packets of Big D peanuts glued to a card behind the bar that, with every purchase, revealed more of a near-naked woman called Bev. None of them survived the great gastropub purge. That said, if you liked poussin, wild rocket, blackboards, Farrow &amp; Ball paint, côtes du rhône and eating on 1950s crockery while sitting on a very stiff, hardbacked chair, this was a golden age. In the UK in 2022, however, almost all new pub ventures are “gastro” to some extent, with the chef’s name and CV being announced at the same time, and with the same weighting, as the landlord’s. All these gastropubs are not the same, though, and many are just chain pubs in disguise and with a good microwave. The Baring, however, is an exceedingly good restaurant that serves the likes of quail shish, and pig’s cheek and smoked eel terrine, and has taken root inside an old, previously loved building. The chef is Rob Tecwyn, formerly of Dabbous, which was a cool, Fitzrovia restaurant revered at the highest level by the food crowd. “Shall we go to Dabbous on Saturday?” someone would suggest on a Wednesday circa 2015, and I’d collapse in peals of mirth because the place was booked solid for the next 20 weeks at least. Tecwyn has also cooked at a number of dependably brilliant restaurants where I often send people asking for advice: the Bull &amp; Last in Highgate, Moro, Morito and Kerridge’s Bar &amp; Grill to name a few. His new place is closest in style to the Bull &amp; Last, because they’re both elegant, gorgeously restored pubs, heaving with spit-and-sawdust history and now serving modern European food, as well as, at times, North African and Scandinavian, plus roasts of the highest order on Sundays. What’s more, the Baring’s general manager, Adam Symonds, met Tecwyn in his Bull &amp; Last days, and you can tell from the second you take a seat that this is a venture born of a hundred late-night conversations about gastropubs, and about what is stale and what is sublime. There’s no sticky toffee pudding on their menu, for example, but there is a large, freshly made warm almond financier with luscious cherries and a pile of thick cream. There’s no blackboard, either, but a brief printed menu. Yes, there are chips on it (served with finest garlic aïoli, incidentally), but there are also unusual plates of delicious weirdness. I’ve eaten grilled leeks and gribiche many times, both separately and together, but at the Baring they’re arranged like an appetising, mustard-coloured, hazelnut-flecked alien life form: part lunch, part Magic Eye puzzle. I gazed at this visual static for some time, hoping to decipher a dolphin. We also ate a piece of very good charred mackerel in a fragrant, salmorejo-style sauce and flanked by courgette, while that quail shish came on a heap of excellent pickled red cabbage, with a small hill of yoghurt topped with a big puddle of pul biber chilli oil. For mains, I chose ricotta gnudi – plump, meaningful balls of cheese and semolina. Whatever happened to semolina pudding? I loved it as a child, but now the only semolina I ever see is in Italian cookery, rather than in a Pyrex dish with jam and eaten while watching Willo The Wisp. Still, I can’t complain, because the Baring’s gnudi come in a pea-green sauce of broad beans, girolles and a generous grating of Italian hard cheese. Charles ordered the roast beef – well, it was a Sunday, after all – which turned out to be a thick slab of grilled Normandy rib with a huge yorkshire pudding and horseradish, with sides of enough roast potatoes to incapacitate a camel and buttery green cabbage strewn with fried breadcrumbs. I drank a glass of non-alcoholic Blurred Vines’ Spark &amp; Sharp “wine”, which was a funky, slightly vinegary little number that made a welcome change from the usual Peroni 0.0% currently available as an afterthought in most pubs. The Baring also offers a rotating choice of beers from breweries such as Burning Sky, Little Earth and Five Points, and aims to favour “spontaneous fermentation beers” – though they’ll also do you a cherry tequila sour if you ask nicely. This will seem to some like “just another bloody north London gastropub”, but discerning eyes will regard it as a benchmark of where pub dining is heading. Stylish simplicity in the decor, scrubbed toilets, and imaginative cookery and ingredients; excellent staff, good beer, no £19 pre-made pulled pork burgers and puddings that are homemade and warm from an actual oven. I’ve seen the future, and it’s fine by me. • The Baring 55 Baring Street, London N1, 020-7916 5861. Open lunch Tues-Sun, noon-2.30pm (3.30pm Sat &amp; Sun); dinner Tues-Sat, 6-9.30pm.

Snacks and starters £4-£12, mains £19-£25, desserts £6-£9, lunch menu, three courses £23, wines from £26 Sitting in the middle of the table at the Rose in Deal is a single food item to which the overused and often abused term “iconic” could reasonably be applied. Pinterest is stuffed full of artfully lit pictures of it. Reputable food mags have breathlessly carried the recipe so that those who haven’t been fortunate enough to eat one can try and fail to make it at home. When it first made its entrance on to London’s sweaty-palmed food scene, the best way to guarantee the right to try one for yourself was to be a hugely talented actor who had, at the very least, been nominated for an Oscar; that, or maybe a few Grammys, or a Bafta. This is because it’s an icing sugar-dusted crab doughnut, one of the star menu items at the Chiltern Firehouse in London’s Marylebone when it opened in 2013. It was created by Nuno Mendes, the Portuguese chef with great, often quirky taste, and a fine, lustrous grey-flecked beard. His crab doughnut came to represent the giddy indulgence of what was, for a while, the hottest, most thrilling A-list restaurant in town. Look at us, it bellowed. We’re so decadent we eat savoury versions of deep-fried dessert junk food. It was a place where the tables were apparently so difficult to nab even the waiting list had a waiting list. The punchline to this overheated joke is that none of the Botoxed, primped and occasionally anally bleached A-listers who went there gave a tuppenny toss about the food. Mendes has a serious track record, from his early modernist experimentation at Bacchus, an East End pub, through the chef’s table at Viajante to Lisboeta, his recent love letter to the country of his birth. But the people he was feeding at the Chiltern Firehouse were only there to see and be obscene. Of course, that crowd eventually moved on. There was some other new hotspot they had to frequent to reinforce their fragile sense of self. Meanwhile, the dishes created for them remain in the chef’s arsenal. Alongside the critically acclaimed Lisboeta, Mendes is also the executive chef of this pub with rooms in the quietly pretty Kent seaside town of Deal. And among the snacks here is that crab doughnut, for £6. In reality, it’s less a luxe homage to a Krispy Kreme than simply a tiny glazed bun, its golden surface dusted with a little sugar, with a sandwich filling of the white meat mixed with crème fraîche, a touch of fish sauce and lemon zest. And how is it? Oh, you know: utterly delightful. There’s a lot about the food served in the bar area of this shabby-chic pub that delights. The fat Mendes thumbprints are all over it. As with that doughnut he loves throwing items into early courses that look like they belong on the dessert menu. At the Chiltern Firehouse there was a salad of Italian leaves with beetroot, orange and candied pecans. Here, there’s a salad of tomatoes, charred peaches, raspberries and almonds. It works because of the salty-sour chilled broth that brings it all together. This is no dessert. His food is also achingly pretty. Behold, a piece of pale pink confited sea trout. Below are golden brown roasted charlotte potatoes. On top is a deep green dice of chives and on top of that, glistening beads of roe, the bright orange of barley twists. This stack sits, in turn, amid a lake of a classical dill butter sauce. Both a lot of thought and a lot of work has gone into this. It means that, despite the pared-down surroundings – the laminated tables, the simple school chairs – it comes at a cost. The tomato salad is £11. The trout dish is £24. My companion, who is from around these parts, says that Deal has made a reasonable accommodation with the influx of various Down From Londons who can pay these prices, and the delis and bistros that have opened in recent years. Later, she will point out a deli across the road which has a window display of crisps sold in faux paint tins. “Yes,” she says, “you might be able to buy crisps in tins, but the town is still very much itself.” Happily, here at the Rose they do a lunch menu with two courses at £19 and three at £23. That starts with a deep, earthy sweet potato soup, the colour of rusting iron, turbo-charged with a thick spoonful of hazelnut pesto. The meat main is a generous breaded and fried pork escalope with what’s described as a raw cabbage salad – a coleslaw by any other name – under an autumnal cloudburst of toasted seeds. That menu finishes with “Nuno’s Portuguese olive oil cake with apricot compote”, an ineffably light sponge delivered still in its baking-paper basket. The golden brown, undulating surface, like the smooth fur folds of a puppy growing into its skin, comes with its own little wake-up of a few flakes of sea salt. There’s a similar trick with a plate of chiffon cake, another extremely light sponge made with vegetable oil, served grilled with lightly seasoned and sliced strawberries, their own raspberry ripple ice-cream and a drizzle of olive oil. The mood here on a weekday lunchtime is relaxed and laid-back as if no one has anywhere in particular to be. That may explain the service, which is delightfully warm, touchingly solicitous and completely all over the place. Nothing is hurried. Drink orders are forgotten, then have to be re-explained. A side salad doesn’t appear, until they suddenly recall it might well have been part of the order and deliver it as we finish our mains. They offer to take that off the bill and inexplicably take a few other things off besides, which then have to get added back on. For anyone worrying that I am dropping someone in it by noting this, they themselves messaged afterwards unprompted to acknowledge that it really had been a virtuoso display of slow, graceful chaos. But the truth is I was in no particular hurry to be anywhere, so while professionally it has to be noted, personally I gave myself to this relaxed dining room and its gentle parade of impressive cooking. Once upon a time it was only for those who could be fagged to fight for a booking at the Chiltern Firehouse. That’s the thing with fashion. Eventually, when the carnival does move on, the rest of us benefit. News bites Nathan Richardson, the former head chef of the famed Guinea Grill in London’s Mayfair, has moved out of town. He has taken over the Lamb Tavern at Buckland in Oxfordshire. On the opening menu: snacks of grilled lamb belly with mint and capers, a beef and bacon suet pastry pie, and turbot with braised ox cheeks, parsnips clams and chervil. Finish with a treacle tart.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(50,'2022-10-02T05:00:29Z','Block Soho: ‘A dreadfully disappointing, poor-value experience’ – restaurant review','Block Soho, Clarion House, 2 Saint Anne’s Court, London W1F 0AZ (020 3376 9999). Starters £9-£17, Sunday lunch £15-£26, desserts £9, wines from £27 Hung on the wall above the urinal at Block Soho was a promotional poster for the Sunday lunch I had recently completed. It bore the slogan: “Whole joints, big flames, good times.” Finally I felt as if I was being looked after. Because if there’s one thing I can use, it’s clear criteria by which to judge a restaurant. So, let’s start in the middle. Once upon a time there were indeed big flames at this site. It’s a wide, low-slung space on a pedestrianised alleyway between Wardour and Dean Streets in London’s Soho. Over the years it has been many things: American deli, tapas bar, Dante’s seventh circle of vodka-drenched hell. In 2015, the company behind both the steak restaurant Goodman and the hilarious luxe steak and seafood joint Beast turned it into a great-value seafood place called Rex and Mariano, but apparently there weren’t enough people in London wanting slurpy, salty clams at £6 a go, because Londoners are idiots. Instead, it became Zelman Meats, named after the owner Mikhail Zelman. They did a small number of things – steaks, slow-roasted short rib, grilled oysters – really well. I recall a terrific Sunday lunch, with irregular Yorkshires the size of sombreros, crisp, dark-hued roasties and slices of what I referred to then as taffeta-pink slices of beef. To cook their steaks, they built a huge charcoal grill into the open kitchen and, when the animal fats dripped, the flames really did become very big indeed; so much so that they erected a transparent protective screen to protect people sitting at the counter edging the kitchen from third-degree burns. They’d sit transfixed as if nose to nose with a caged wild animal. In a way, they were. Zelman’s closed during lockdown, but little has been done to the space since the new owners arrived, bar some expensive branding on the walls. They have retained the circular marble trough just inside the door along with the booths and high-tops. Sadly, though, it seems the caged animal has been released. If there are big flames in this new restaurant, they’re not in the open kitchen this Sunday lunchtime. It contains just two hassled-looking cooks. The grill is unlit. Which brings me to the promise of “whole joints”. At Block Soho on Sundays there’s a choice of pork, lamb or beef. The latter arrives in slices. If those slices came off whole joints, I would expect them to be pink, which is exactly what they prepared for our photographer at a later date. Instead, ours had been seared on all sides like minute steaks. We should take their word for it that ours came from a single joint. But then why sear it? Not that it makes much difference: it’s a tough, extremely indifferent piece of meat. The pork is wet and dreary and comes without crackling, which I regard as a personal insult. The lamb is a wintery shade of grey as, at times, am I. These three dishes with sides cost between £21 and £24 for three slices. You can have one of all three, but that will cost you £26 for exactly the same amount of meat. The menu also offers “Roasts – fresh from the sea”. Apparently, the fish didn’t fancy it and stayed there. They have no fish, unlike the chippie across the alley which has loads. The meat dishes come with stodgy, strikingly uniform Yorkshires. God’s own country might see this as cause for a defamation suit. There are dense, pallid roast potatoes the colour of disappointment, and “charred” batons of root vegetable that are undercooked and present little evidence of charring. This is unsurprising given the apparent lack of flames with which to char them. Let’s hear it, then, for the pleasing buttered cabbage. Let’s also hear it for what they call “block gravy”. It makes me wonder what sort of block was involved. It’s thick and sludgy and bears a striking resemblance to something I once made from a packet at home, for shits and giggles. This is remarkable, given they must have made it from scratch. Before that there is, well, food. I keep looking at the photo on my phone of the “pulled” pork on sourdough toast in thick apple gravy; it looks chopped, which is a different thing entirely. The non-meat option of creamed chargrilled celeriac is under-seasoned. There is a miserly portion of beef carpaccio with bluntly shaved parmesan, but disguised nicely by squiggles from a squeezy bottle of thick balsamic dressing. The best option is the English seafood cocktail of prawns and crayfish, as it should be at £17. Interestingly, for a restaurant promoting their Sunday lunch offering, the one dessert they don’t have today is the apple crumble. Perhaps they didn’t get their crumble deliveries. A dark chocolate tart has a hefty filling and soft, damp pastry. I ask if they make it on site. They say they do. Nice that they’ve taken responsibility. The cream in a seasonal fruit mess has been overwhipped and is split. We hunt through the clumping globules of dairy fat for the promised meringue, but eventually call off the search, exhausted. It’s true that restaurants often find domestic food rituals like Sunday lunch hard to pull off. Zelman Meats managed a good one; this, however, was described by one of my companions as the sort of thing you’d be served in an underachieving pub smelling of wet dog, for £6.95. As that companion is my wife I’m not going to argue. What drives me nuts is that significant amounts of money have been spent here on branding and sloganising; on creating the idea of a cool restaurant. But just saying stuff doesn’t make it so, if you don’t also invest in good ingredients and people able to prepare them adequately. For reference, during the rest of the week there’s a menu of salt-aged steak cuts, but don’t hope for bargains. The ribeye here is 47% more expensive per 100g than at Hawksmoor, the rump is 33% more expensive and the fillet 31% more expensive. Credit must go to the front-of-house staff who deliver this dreadfully disappointing, poor-value experience with charm and efficiency. Sadly, charm and efficiency will only get you so far. For here I am stood in the bog, staring at the words “good times” on the poster in front of me, thinking, “I really could have done with some of those.” It’s time to zip up and go home. News bites A sign of how drastically the cost-of-living crisis is impacting upon the hospitality sector: Creams, which operates over 100-plus dessert parlours across the UK through franchise partners, has announced a raft of support measures for its operators. At the core of franchise agreements is a royalty paid to the operator on all products sold. Creams is reducing those royalty fees from next month until February 2023. The fact they are looking to open another 10 branches of the ice-cream and cake bar by the end of this calendar year may have something to do with it. At creamscafe.com.

If you’ve ever tried living in this Unesco World Heritage site, this will be no surprise. There was once a very useful railway track linking Penrith, Keswick and Cockermouth that trundled through picturesque villages and served the local community but someone bright closed it down in 1966. So, for the past three and a half decades, transport issues around Embleton, Dubwath and Braithwaite have been mainly covered by a man called Colin in a Vauxhall Tigra, assuming he’s not at the pig auction. Meanwhile, the station at Bassenthwaite Lake fell into disrepair. That was, until the arrival of Simon and Diana Parums’ project, with its full-sized replica of a French SNCF steam train that featured in the 2017 film version of Murder on the Orient Express. Inside the carriage, they’ll now do you a rather good afternoon tea while you sit parked by a newly restored 140-metre platform close to a nature walk; you can even hire one of the coaches for private parties. OK, it’s all quite idyllic, which is why I’m sharing the news today, and this despite several firm requests from my family, who love grabbing a table here, to, well, “shut your cakehole”. As well as afternoon tea, they do generous sharing platters, lunch bowls and sandwiches, plus there’s a fridge heaving with cakes to buy by the slice (I’m particularly partial to the dark chocolate orange sponge). Yes, there is an irony about how this wonderful, totally cut-off part of the world now has a gorgeous fake railway station painted in the original official blood-and-custard Penrith-to-Cockermouth track colours, where visitors can take selfies next to a movie prop train, all the while imagining how marvellous it might be actually to travel somewhere, but let’s overlook the lack of local transport provision and concentrate instead on the two-tier afternoon tea. There’s a mini slider, a homemade sausage roll, a sugary macaroon, a raspberry mousse, a chocolate brownie and sticky toffee pudding cake with fresh strawberries, and large, plump fruit scones. This afternoon tea errs on the sturdy side, which I am heavily pro; dainty bites and tiny ramekins have their place, but I much prefer an afternoon tea that incapacitates. Booking is advisable, however, especially if you want to sit in one of the carriages. That said, I like it as much in the old station booking office and waiting area, with the framed jigsaws on the walls. It’s all a bit Brief Encounter as you wait for your “platelayer’s salad”, which is a riff on the ploughman’s lunch, with sticky, glazed Cumberland sausage, chicken liver paté and miller loaf. The Cumbrian sharing platter, meanwhile, features local salamis and ham, Lakeland beef, baked brie from the fells of Torpenhow, and Cumberland sauce, which is a type of mustardy, redcurranty mush that Elizabeth David once described as “the best of all sauces for cold meat”. If that all sounds rather meaty, I must also make a nod to the vegan brunch bowl, which is thoughtfully put together: slices of green lentil and bean roast, sauteed cavolo nero, roast spuds and sun-blushed tomatoes are drizzled with a bloody mary ketchup. It’s more evidence of how vegan food in the north has come on in leaps and bounds in the past five years. Gone are the days of the befuddled look and the offer of an egg bap or a solitary portobello mushroom served as a main course. Never in a million years did I expect to find crisp pulled salt-and-pepper seitan with chipotle vegan mayo in a casual cafe just off the A66, but magical things are happening. Even so, I worry for the smaller Lake District hospitality ventures right now, because they, like many others, are being crippled by staff shortages. In Keswick, almost every cafe in town is currently begging for staff, with some spots no longer able to open full time; it was a worrying sight recently to see even the local Greggs closed because there was no one available to switch on the ovens. The Lake District has no shortage of visitors – Scafell Pike, for one, is teeming with them – but there are fewer than ever bodies available to serve them cream teas and ice-creams or to sell them Kendal mint cake. The reasons for this are varied and opaque, but it has nevertheless been satisfying to watch Bassenthwaite Lake Station go from strength to strength since it opened last summer. Yes, it’s a train that goes nowhere, but the food is wonderful. I’ve eaten enough pre-packed sandwiches on Avanti West Coast trains while whistling through Warrington Bank Quays to prefer the make-believe.

It took root on the Side, one of the few medieval streets left in Tyneside, which also boasts the Crown Posada pub, said to be about 240 years old. Newcastle is a brilliant and often overlooked city. When I was a child, on our pilgrimages from Carlisle some 60 miles away, it felt a bit like Manhattan: we’d eat stotties and Tudor crisps, then ransack Geordie Jeans for the latest ice-wash skin-tights. Coming back years later to visit Solstice by Kenny Atkinson is a considerably more refined experience. Atkinson also owns the Michelin-starred House of Tides a quick amble away along Quayside, where he dishes up fine dining in a semi-casual atmosphere. At Solstice, however, the sky is the limit, and he has full licence to unleash his imagination and intentions to wow. This isn’t just fine dining; it is an 18-course, three-hour tip-toe through dishes so ornately and painstakingly prepared that at times it feels a shame to eat them. All that work, deliberation and manpower for a few blissful seconds during which I open my mouth like a boa constrictor and allow the most exquisite burst of silky, pungent cod’s roe, ensconced in a seaweed-green cracker and dotted with lemon verbena gel, to glide down my throat. Or a beer-laced croustade casing filled with the softest goat’s curd puree, topped with lush, green peas and garnished with pickled wild garlic capers, mint gel and chive flowers … oh, yes, and calendula leaves, too – though if I’m being 100% honest, the ingredients and genesis of each dish come at you so thick and fast, it can’t help but all be something of a blur. Solstice is a sedate single room with a mere 14 seats, all of which are taken on a Tuesday night in late August, despite the news headlines being dominated by financial gloom. The couple behind me were on a big wedding anniversary – one they cheerfully described as “more of a life sentence” – before settling into a glorious evening of fine wine, great food and finishing each other’s jokes. There will, I feel, always be a place for the kind of cooking Atkinson and his ilk yearn to deliver, because it is special food for the most special of special occasions. Solstice serves a tiny taste of fine, fresh mackerel topped with gooseberry gel and nasturtium, and the richest squab pigeon and veal sweetbreads. You wouldn’t want to eat like this even twice a month, but, as a rare treat, such experiences rouse parts of the brain and palate that beige carbs just can’t quite reach. Yes, dinner takes an age, but it totters along merrily, with chefs feeding you first tiny tastes of exquisite tomato churros with consommé in dinky, magnetic espresso cups, followed by the butteriest warm oyster in its shell topped with caviar, before moving on to the heavier hitters. Yes, more caviar – rather a lot of Petrossian, in fact – featured as the topping for a dreamy smoked eel and potato cream that came with chicken skin crackers. The highlight for me, I think, was a chunky slab of fragrant langoustine with the most peculiar-looking purple potato tart hewn from langoustine claw and festooned in herbs and flowers. But then again, I should also mention the lamb course, which turned up with a voluminous mini-loaf all glossy with lamb fat and express instructions to use it to mop up the delightful gravy. By this point, my spy work on the other customers had detected four chefs enjoying their nights off and at least three anniversaries. Plus, of course, me and Charles, for whom each day must feel like Christmas. As our dinner reached the sweet end of proceedings, I was concerned that this is where it would all go a bit “pear poached in sap” and “fragments of yeast”, because the titivations of a tasting menu do not often lend themselves to the pudding course. I was very wrong: there is a perfect, pretty-yet-bizarre-looking dessert featuring local honey delivered at least six ways, plus a plate of petits fours with shaved truffle, apple and dark chocolate that would sate even the sweetest tooth. All incredibly long tasting menus are not built equally. For every Ynyshir, Moor Hall or Ikoyi – and Solstice is easily as impressive as those three – there are others that keep you hostage for hours, offering endless edible gold leaf and interminable pauses, and leaving you hungrier when you leave than you were when you arrived. That’s why I appreciate the theatre, the pacing and the exquisite attention to detail of the likes of Solstice. Winter may indeed be coming, but this place is celebrating the light.

Despite living on Warren Street a mere 10 years – a blink in London’s history – Honey &amp; Co had snuck its way into many food-lovers’ hearts, largely because of its casual, ever-affable brilliance. It wasn’t a “smart jacket and longstanding reservation” type of brilliant. You could pitch up to Sarit Packer and Itamar Srulovich’s small Middle Eastern restaurant any given Tuesday at brunch time and they’d try to squeeze you in for green shakshuka and merguez sausage rolls. Or for a few rounds of sabich (roasted aubergine smeared on to fresh pitta). Sarit grew up in northern Israel; Itamar was born in Jerusalem. Sarit, at one stage, headed the pastry teams for Ottolenghi’s restaurants, while Itamar was head chef at the Notting Hill and Belgravia branches. Honey &amp; Co was their fledgling solo project and London took to the couple’s dinner-time meze feasts avidly. My memories are of humid London nights mopping up hummus made with fresh broad beans and ramson-leaf labneh, or eating paprika-seasoned feta. Honey &amp; Co’s devil was in the detail: this wasn’t just falafel; they were fresh falafel on a seasoned slick of tahini with a fragrant Lebanese cucumber salad, and the chicken shish came with a verdant freekeh and a lush pea and herb salad. Eating far more than you intended was de rigueur, on account of an unquantifiable orange-blossom-scented largesse in the ambience that foxed customers into ordering the feta and honey cheesecake. This is where full-fat Philadelphia meets double cream, icing sugar and feta and sits heroically on a kadaif pastry nest. When Honey &amp; Co Warren Street announced it was closing there was much mewling from fans, although a plan was quickly in place to reopen in an alternative Bloomsbury home, on Lamb’s Conduit Street, directly opposite the marvellous Noble Rot – a name all readers should have stashed for a special occasion. Honey &amp; Co and Noble Rot being within winking distance of each other feels wholly correct; they’re both restaurants that have quietly become stalwarts of the London dining scene. Still, as I set off for my first dinner at the all-new, somewhat fresher and prettier Honey &amp; Co, I had trepidations. You can’t just “move” a restaurant. The magic is in a plethora of small things other than food: the acoustics, the convergence of tables, traffic noises, the location of the loos, too much or too little cooking odour, and on and on. Proprietors can move locations and serve the same dishes on the same plates but the spell is somehow broken. I shouldn’t have worried because on a warm July evening – the sort of weather that leaves the back of your knees damp – the demand for spare seats was fervent as I sat enjoying a jug of iced tea. The summer 2022 menu is one of their best. Beware: the small plates are hefty, so a diminutive-sounding “house pickle plate” was an abundance of dressed kohlrabi, pickled cucumber, beetroot and carrot and kalamata olives. A peach salad with juicy, sweet fruit and goat’s cheese strewn with almonds was remarkable. The hummus isn’t merely squished chickpea, but a vessel for a pungent green chilli tatbila dressing, topped with crisp, deep-fried chickpeas. If your appetite is small, one could really stop ordering there. But that’s not fun, is it? Why miss the crispy lamb shoulder with feta and urfa butter dressing that comes with a lush rocket and mint salad and feels like loading vitamin-powered goodness directly into your face? Or a serving of crisp za’atar-encrusted potatoes on labneh, which was priced at a rather eye-popping £13.50, but was enough to feed two or three? Yes, Honey &amp; Co is a little different now, perhaps more grownup and formal, but the old loveliness is there in spades. Service was warm and prompt, and when the food began to arrive, there were audible gasps over the attention to detail, because you can buy Honey &amp; Co recipe books until you’re blue in the face, but you’ll never make Yemeni falafel or taramasalata with pickled red onion and chopped egg quite like they are served here. Rejoice! The feta and honey cheesecake is still on offer. However, I recommend the chocolate terrazzo cake, a slice of stiff, glossy, wowish triple-chocolate layered gateau served – on the evening I visited – with a marzipan ice-cream that could be one of the greatest things I’ve eaten this year. We discussed this ice-cream for several days afterwards. It wasn’t even billed on the menu. Why would they hide it? Was it an impromptu invention? Will there be more of it? These things keep me awake at night. There’s a lot of things to worry about in life right now. I prefer to focus on my stomach.

When we imagine ourselves on the shore, we envisage being in a simpler place; somewhere less challenging, somewhere built for calmness. Certainly, a lot of us have a fantasy summer life and a part of that fantasy involves eating great food by the sea, at a price that will not force us to ponder the sale of a vital organ. Happily, it doesn’t have to remain a fantasy. Here are 10 recommendations for great places along our beautiful coastline where the food is terrific and the price qualifies as great value. Here you’ll find gloriously thick crab sandwiches for just a few quid, alongside keenly priced cheese toasties that will sustain you through Britain’s quixotic summer weather. There is, of course, fish and chips; there has to be fish and chips. But there are also seafood platters, south-east Asian curries, intriguing small plates and so much more. For sake of doubt, these aren’t listings cobbled together from a reading of vaguely convincing websites. I’ve been lucky enough to eat the food provided by every one of them, often more than once. Yes, it’s a personal selection, but it’s one that’s been properly road-tested, in the service of proper appetite. You may have your own favourites. We’d love to hear about them. These, however, in no particular order, are mine. No 1 Cromer, Norfolk At his flagship restaurant, Morston Hall, Galton Blackiston does all the shiny evolved things you would expect of a chef with the usual stars and garlands to his name. No 1 Cromer is a different matter entirely. Yes, it’s somewhat glossier than your average chippy, with prices to match, but it does do the basics very well indeed. Starters include cockle popcorn with chilli vinegar, or salt and pepper squid, both for £8.50. Follow that with a fair old slab of cod, haddock or plaice with chips for around £15. If that price risks making you choke on your gherkins, go for the takeaway option, where the fish is around £7.50. You can also get battered brie for £4.20 and scampi for £7. During the summer months it runs Ice Cromer, its ice-cream kiosk on the seafront with a choice of 15 flavours including salted peanut butter and rhubarb and custard. 1 New St, Cromer NR27 9HP; 01263 515983; no1cromer.com Michael Wan’s Wok Inn, Blackpool, Lancashire If you want cheap fish and chips of distinctly variable quality, or indeed anything that’s been for a lengthy swim in the deep fat fryer, you really won’t need my help locating it on the seafront in Blackpool. Just sniff the air and follow your nose. But you may crave something else and Michael Wan’s Wok Inn is definitely something else. It’s a spin-off from Michael Wan’s Mandarin, one of Britain’s most venerable Cantonese restaurants, located in the centre of town. The Wok Inn, launched by the next generation of the same family, is a knowingly raucous and eclectic take on the food of south-east Asia, and at a very decent price. The interior is a brilliantly garish mess of painted and poster-splattered corrugated iron, dangling lampshades, fairy lights, mismatched furniture, white tiling and the occasional dragon motif. Both sets of loos are home to a shrine to the phallus. It comes with the territory, that territory being Blackpool. The food, which comes in Lancashire portions, is what matters. Start with its cloud-like char sui buns for £4.95, or be brave and have the salt and chilli duck tongues for £7.10. Make sure to have a heaving plate of its old-school spare ribs, glazed in the shiniest and brightest of barbecue sauces for £8.80. They’re exactly like fabulous Chinese restaurant spare ribs used to be, before decorum took hold. Or just go for one of the main dishes from the list headed Around Asia, which cost in the mid-teens but are very much a full meal in themselves. Many of them are served in multi-layered tiffin boxes: the beef rendang, wafting heavily of freshly roasted spices, comes with the flakiest of roti canai, domes of steamed rice and a sweet-sour crunchy salad, all stacked one atop the other. It’s the same story with a massaman curry, made with chicken on the bone, and the pad thai or nasi goreng. The Wok Inn is a true original. 118 Promenade, Blackpool FY1 1RA; 01253 627368; michaelwanswokinn.co.uk Fish and Chips at 149, Bridlington, Yorkshire People get very competitive when it comes to the knotty business of recommending the best chippies. Our relationship with this seaside classic can be extremely personal and emotional, so choosing one is a risky business. Therefore, let me say that the British coast is punctuated by many truly brilliant exponents of the noble craft, and you will doubtless have your own favourite. However, I’ve chosen Fish and Chips at 149, because I once spent a terrific day there learning the ropes as a fryer, shortly after it had been named the best fish and chip shop in Britain. The shop is located in town, but my main memory, after a day’s hard graft, was taking my paper-wrapped package down to the Bridlington seafront and eating it while staring out at the waters. Bliss. The regular cod is £5.79 with the challengingly large coming in at £6.39. Impeccable chips are £2.39 and, because this is Yorkshire, are fried in beef dripping. All accessories are present and correct, including curry sauce and mushy peas. The best deal is the basic fish and chips with one side at £6.59. It’s all good. 149 Marton Rd, Bridlington YO16 7DJ (also at Barnard Castle and Catterick Garrison); 149fishandchips.co.uk The Urchin, Hove, East Sussex This blocky corner pub in a quiet residential area may be a couple of streets inland, but no matter. It’ll bring the sea to your table. The seafood cooking is bold, boisterous and exceedingly well priced. The short standing menu of salt and pepper squid, moules mariniere and the like is always supplemented by an extensive list of specials. It might be giant tiger prawns with chilli oil for £7 or roast scallops with oyster mushrooms and chicken fat butter for £10. Do try the pleasingly messy Malaysian king prawns, in a portion that’s very much big enough to share. There is a concise wine list but the pub is much better known for an obsession with beer. So developed is that obsession, it even has a microbrewery in the basement. That means its own brew, Larrikin, is always on tap. For sunny days there’s a beer garden. 15-17 Belfast St, Hove BN3 3YS; 01273 241881; urchinpub.co.uk The Cheesy Toast Shack, St Andrews, Fife There are few food items better engineered for the elemental challenges of a trip to the Scottish seaside than a cheese toastie, and there are few places that do them better than these two takeaway operations on the beach in St Andrews. These are serious items, built to keep you going as the winds blow and the sea crashes. The bread is cut thick. It’s bronzed and a little oily outside, with a deep filling. And all of them cost around a fiver. You can go for something pretty basic from the regularly changing menu; perhaps the Scottish cheddar with smoked ham and pickle. Or you can be a little more adventurous. There’s the manchego with chorizo, red pepper and jalapeno chutney, or the New Yorker made with sliced swiss, pastrami, American mustard and sauerkraut. If it’s available, try the carb-on-carb joy of the mac’n’cheese, with a dense filling that’s forever attempting to make a bid for freedom. All of them are available in gluten free versions. An absolute gem. Woodburn Place, St Andrews KY16 8LA (also at Kingsbarns beach); facebook.com/thecheesytoastshack JoJo’s Meze, Meat &amp; Fish, Tankerton, Kent JoJo’s in Tankerton, housed in a whitewashed wedge of a building perched above the sea just outside Whitstable has, over the years, become a much-loved local landmark. So beloved is it, indeed, that when the business was under threat last summer because the landlords wanted to sell their building, its fans, including chef Tom Kerridge and Suggs of Madness, came together to help raise £100,000 so they could buy it. The appeal of JoJo’s is straightforward: rustic Mediterranean cooking by chef Nikki Billington, and relaxed easygoing service led by her partner, Paul Watson. There’s a spacious terrace, often used for barbecues, and an airy dining room, with huge picture windows looking out over the waters. You could knock up a sizable bill if you really put your back into it, but there are bargains to be had. Chief among them is the mixed mezze plate for two or three to share at £35. It includes – deep breath – hummus, tzatziki, crustini, Moroccan bulgur wheat salad, puy lentil shallot and herb salad, an Indian spiced chickpea salad, hunks of various cheeses, cured meats, olives and bread. In other words, the works. Do try to keep space for the calamari; Billington has a rare talent for deep frying, an often underrated skill. And make sure to ask to see the pudding blackboard. She does those properly. 2 Herne Bay Rd, Tankerton CT5 2LQ; 01227 274591; jojosrestaurant.co.uk Bayside Social, Worthing, West Sussex MasterChef winner Kenny Tutt’s second venture is housed in a handsome glass, wood and steel pavilion right on the beach at Worthing, and is open throughout the year regardless of what the elements may throw at it. In the summer months, however, it becomes an indoor-outdoor space as the floor-to-ceiling doors are thrown wide open. You could get a table and roam through the list of imaginative small plates: roast cod with romesco, burrata with heirloom tomatoes and pesto, or perhaps king prawns with garlic and Aleppo chilli, all at around £8 or £9 a go. But without doubt it’s the takeaway Hatch that really makes the place. From 8.30am until 11.30am it’s a breakfast menu of seriously stacked muffins, with old spot sausages or dry cured bacon, from a fiver. From noon until late afternoon, it’s the lunch menu. There’s a fillet of fish sandwich with chunky tartare and sliced pickles in a brioche bun, a portion of calamari with roasted garlic and lemon aioli, or Bayside tacos filled with spiced tempura jackfruit with cucumber chilli salsa, feta and hot sauce, each for around £7.50. 1 Beach Parade, Worthing BN11 2FG; 01903 867050; baysidesocial.co.uk The Company Shed, West Mersea, Essex The Company Shed was once a secret, fiercely guarded by locals and fans alike, who knew how quickly the queue could build up. Over the years it has become far better known, and perhaps as a result encountered growing competition from other seafood restaurants and cafes nearby, but it remains true to itself. The stars of the show are the groaning crab platter at £20 a head, or the cockles platter at £17.50. Rock oysters, filtered in tanks out the back, are £1.50 each (or £15 for a dozen). In recent years it has started serving more evolved dishes, including mussels with a garlic and herb crust, scallops in thyme butter with bacon, and pan-fried spicy crab cakes. It is now licensed though you are still welcome to bring your own drinks. As the sign on the wall says, “Help yourself to glasses from the shelf.” It’s that sort of place. There’s also an extensive takeaway menu including a pint of shell-on prawns at £4.40, and closed oysters at 85p each. A word of warning: West Mersea is a tidal island, and at high tide the causeway back to the rest of Essex does get fully submerged. Check the tide timetables, or you may find yourself spending a few more hours there than you planned. It’s no hardship. Just have a few more oysters. 129 Coast Rd, West Mersea CO5 8PA; 01206 382700 Oban Seafood Hut, Oban, Argyll and Bute Do not make the pilgrimage down the Calmac ferry pier at Oban on Scotland’s west coast expecting grand facilities. The clue is in the word “hut”. Sometimes it’s referred to as the “green shack”, on account of the bright grass-like colour frontage. Either way it’s a very simple affair: there’s a modern, if temporary looking kitchen with a hatch, and alongside that, a long gnarled wooden table under a canopy structure for when the weather sweeps in, as it often will. What matters is the serious quality seafood, presented to the very best of its advantage. People talk in hushed tones about the crab sandwich, just £4.95 for something the thickness of an airport novel, only with more drama and intrigue. Or try a sandwich of salmon, hot smoked on site. A heaving portion of fat king scallops, or langoustines from the very waters you eat next to, comes in a deep bath of garlic butter and costs £10.50. Or there’s crab claws at £11.50. The crockery is entirely disposable and the whole experience prone to messiness, but all in the very best way. There’s an awful lot of very good seafood available in Oban; this is the one option you shouldn’t miss. Calmac Pier, Oban PA34 4DB; 07881 418565; facebook.com/obanseafood.hut.9 The Watch House, St Mawes, Cornwall Anyone who knows the gorgeous Cornish fishing town of St Mawes will already understand that it doesn’t exactly wear its profound beauty lightly. It has become a favoured tourist spot for those with very deep pockets, and if they find their way to places like the dining room of the Hotel Tresanton or the one at The Idle Rocks, they are most certainly going to need them. But there are cheaper joys to be found here, among them the Watch House, which occupies a former Customs and Excise building in the town square at the heart of the seafront, as it curves away. It’s run by chef Will Gould and general manager John Brown, and in the summer months the restaurant, with its menu of seafood pastas, roasted shellfish platters and grilled scallops with wild garlic butter, becomes booked up very quickly. However, it also has a hatch serving the very best takeaways in town. A proper slab of golden beer-battered cod and chips costs £8.25. It makes its own salmon, pollock and smoked haddock fish cakes with chips or salad for £8.95, and for 75p it will give you extra toppings of aged cheddar, smoked streaky bacon or its own chilli jam. Just be aware: it’s exceedingly popular. On summer evenings, long queues build up and it doesn’t take telephone orders. Still, the view from here on the Roseland Peninsula out over the water will keep you distracted while you wait. 1 The Square, St Mawes TR2 5DJ; 01326 270038; watchhousestmawes.co.uk','https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jul/17/jay-rayner-favourite-places-eat-british-coastline-essex-oysters-toasties-scotland','Jay Rayner','NR27 9HP',1.29941594999999998,52.9325981100000007,0.765000000000000013);

No lunchtime bookings. Snacks £3.50, plates and skewers £5.50-£14, desserts £5-£7, wines from £24 It would be easy, for which read lazy, to describe Nottingham’s Kushi-Ya as a hidden gem. Granted, it’s very much tucked away. The first time I visited the site was virtually, courtesy of Google Street View. I clicked my way across a main road, past outposts of Maryland Chicken and Mega Munch, and found myself studying the digital vista of a hard-scrabble urban alleyway; the sort that might play host to fumbling couples who can’t quite wait to get indoors after the pubs kick out. But hidden gems need to be found. The fact that a London-based restaurant reviewer like me hasn’t previously found their way to this blissfully good place celebrating the flavours and methods of Japan’s izakayas doesn’t mean it’s begging to be discovered. Early on a weekday lunchtime it fills quickly with locals who obviously know it’s there. As I ate my way from one totally banging, beautifully conceived, perfectly priced dish to another, two thoughts occurred to me. The first was that I really must thank my Nottingham-based friend, the terrifically witty and clever novelist Mhairi McFarlane, for the recommendation. (Consider yourself thanked, Mhairi). The second thought was: why, bar a small mention in Olive magazine, had I found nothing else about it in the national press since it opened in 2018? It started, as so many great food ventures do these days, with a supper club. This one was run by Simon Carlin, then the head chef of Nottingham’s Iberico World Tapas, and Tom Clay from The Railway, a pub at Lowdham, a few miles east of the city. Tickets would sell out quickly. Eventually, they took over this upper-floor space, in the rafters of a listed building, formerly the home of a vegetarian café. (It’s reached by a steep staircase and because the building is listed there is no lift, so it’s not wheelchair accessible.) There is a little vertical blond-wood panelling and a flash of blue tiling on the side of the bar where there is a counter with extra seats. A couple of mildly austere Japanese jackets are hung on the walls as decoration. Otherwise, it is a clean white space of bare-wood tables, beneath the vaulting beamed roof space. There’s an open kitchen on a raised level, occupied by intense young British men with matching beards. What comes out of there is a deft collection of wonders. The menu is divided between snacks, small plates and skewers, supplemented by a couple of specials. Most of it is priced at around £6 or £7 a plate, with just one dish reaching the dizzy heights of £14. We’ll get to it. We start with their sweet, sour and crunchy pickled daikon, baby turnips and cucumber. So far so jolly. But now comes the first sign that something intriguing is going on here. Their prawn toast is a sweet inversion. The golden fried bread is the casing for a thick spring roll enclosing a tight bundle of squeakily fresh prawns. There’s a squiggle of umami-rich Japanese mayonnaise and, across that, a generous sprinkle of furikake seasoning, that potent flavour bomb of nori, sesame and bonito. It’s both delicious and funny. Next come tempura shishito peppers in a lacy batter overcoat, like padrón peppers that have been taught the dance of the seven veils, with a soy-based dipping sauce. From the specials, for a mighty £8.50 we get a beautiful piece of Japanese ceramics filled with sautéed wild mushrooms in a nutty brown butter ponzu sauce. There is a confit egg yolk, the colour of the setting sun, to be mixed in with the mushrooms, and across that handfuls of cress for a micro hit of pepperiness. Now I am in love. The skewers menu is just as much fun. New potatoes are barbecued until smoky and bursting from their skins, then drenched in a creamy dressing flecked with the green of dried seaweed. They call it a nori ranch. But why stop there? For here come fat dribbles of their thick chilli oil full of toasty notes and power. It is potatoes shown an awful lot of love and affection. Follow that from the specials with thickly glazed duck hearts grilled so they still have bite, then dotted with yellow splodges of nose-tickling mustard. Or have the chicken tsukune, the meat minced and seasoned, and formed on the skewers as pointed ovals, before being grilled and glazed, with another of their egg yolks. Perhaps you want something a little brighter alongside all these dark, caramel and soy glazes? Perhaps you need a slight breather. Welcome to the table, then, a bowl of greens, steamed just so, in a yuzu and ginger dressing engineered to give you a gentle back rub. Right. Back in we go. Their contribution to the cult of the sando, which is to say outrageous things between thick crustless slabs of the best white bread, plays as a joyous riff on the prawn cocktail. Chopped prawns are formed into a thick patty that has been breaded and fried. That’s slammed into the bread and smeared thickly with a gochujang-boosted marie rose sauce. Yes, of course, there’s shredded lettuce. As well as being delicious, it’s a textural thrill. Finally, before (almost) admitting defeat, we have a serious hunk of pork shoulder, slow braised and then caramelised in sweet soy. The thickly glazed meat pulls apart. It comes with a ginger and spring onion relish, a bowl of golden tempura scraps and a tiny squeezy bottle of sweet sauce, alongside crisp lettuce leaves to be used as wraps, much like a Korean ssambap. It’s both clever and a huge amount of serious entertainment for £14. The dessert list includes a Tira-miso, a Japanese take on the Italian classic. We have the hyper-sweet frozen black sugar parfait with a thick, golden sesame crisp. Soften that sugar rush with a sake, or a yuzu margarita or try one of their Japanese whiskies. The beer list goes beyond the usual offering of Asahi. At some point, probably when I was wrapping one of those darling pieces of melting pork shoulder in lettuce, I muttered under my breath that Kushi-Ya was my restaurant of the year. A few days on, and I hold to that. Maybe something will come along in the next couple of months to prove me wrong, but in terms of wit, skill, deliciousness, price and just all-round utter joy I can’t imagine that happening. It isn’t a hidden gem. I just didn’t happen to know it was there. I’m glad I do now. News bites Good news from Sheffield. In May, shortly after I had reviewed my very agreeable lunch there, Juke &amp; Loe announced that the lease was up on their Ecclesall Road site. Brothers Luke and Joseph Grayson had been unable to negotiate a suitable renewal and hence would have to close. Now they have posted less than subtle hints on their Instagram account – a shot of the street sign, with the offer of a free meal for two for the first person to guess the location – that they are taking over the site of what was Milestone on Ball Street in Kelham Island. No date has yet been announced for the reopening. Elsewhere in Sheffield, Joro owners Luke French and Stacey Sherwood-French have coined the truly appalling word ‘grocerant’ for what does sound like an interesting venture: a combination of food shop and restaurant, due to launch in spring 2023 as part of the redevelopment of the city’s Oughtibridge Paper Mill. And this week’s ‘read the room’ special: an email arrives from three-Michelin-star Core by Clare Smyth in London’s Kensington. On 1 November they are staging what they say will be an ‘unmissable dining experience’. It’s a menu of five courses, each of which will be paired with ‘different expressions’ of the champagne house Dom Pérignon. You know the sort of thing. A caviar sandwich with white truffles to go with the 2012 vintage; Scottish lobster to go with the 2008. Sounds good? Why not book a seat or two. It’s £850 a head, though that does include service (corebyclaresmyth.com).

Tasting menus £50 and £90, plus supplements. Snacks £3.50-£9, plates £9-£24, desserts £9, wines from £31 Recently, I was emailed by Liam Barrie, one of the brothers behind Lerpwl in Liverpool. Might I consider reviewing the restaurant that he and Ellis Barrie had opened in 2020? Not only might I consider it: I had considered it feverishly, multiple times, and with good reason. The Barrie brothers have a great story. As very young men they turned a small café, by a remote mobile home park in Anglesey, into what quickly became a point of gastronomic pilgrimage. The Marram Grass was reputedly a place that took North Wales’s finest ingredients and turned them into edible wonders. Now they had moved to the city and taken over a space in the redbrick mercantile palace which is Albert Dock for Lerpwl, the Welsh for Liverpool. Early on, I looked at their website. I looked at it every time I was due to review in Liverpool. Each time I was driven to disappointed, knuckle-chewing distraction. The menus were on dropbox links, a nightmare on mobile, if they worked at all. This stuff matters. Restaurants, sort your websites. An extraordinary number hide their street address away in a dusty digital recess or don’t bother to include it at all. And please, add a phone number for people who are running late and want to tell you. The booking websites are a nightmare for this sort of thing. Why not offer a WhatsApp number if you can’t bear the idea of talking to your customers? The bigger problem with Lerpwl was the proposition. You could have anything you liked there as long as it was a tasting menu, either at £90 or £50, but with multiple supplements which added an extra £31 to both. One menu was called the “Capricious”. What? A dinner marked by sudden changes of mood and behaviour? If I wanted that, I could stay home and argue with my family. It all just sounded exhausting. I hadn’t pointed any of this out. If enough people want a £121 tasting menu, then good luck to them. But as they had now asked me to come, I explained why I hadn’t. They acknowledged my points. Recently, I looked back at their website. And lo, the dropbox links had gone, broken links had been fixed, and they had introduced a “plates” menu, essentially an à la carte: a few snacks, some bigger plates, three steak cuts, all for sharing. The least I could do was book a table. First the fundamentals: despite all the grand tasting-menu stuff, they make a lot of their relaxed vibe. While the square open kitchen is staffed with very intense, very wired young men, the big broad room vibrates with friendly, relaxed chatter. It’s a place of hard surfaces, original Victorian columns and bare tables dressed with enough cutlery to cater a rugby club buffet. Some of the food really is spectacular. Among the short snacks list are silvery Menai oysters. One is dressed with a dice of compressed cucumber, glistening pearls of dill oil and a spritz of sweet acidity; the other comes with fermented chilli, sesame and seaweed. Both are a total knockout burst of invigorating seaside loveliness. There’s a tart of minutely cubed duck pastrami in a beautifully folded savoury tuile. Their cylindrical triple-cooked chips are as golden as polished copper coins and come with a hilariously rich, artery-nagging hollandaise made with duck fat rather than olive oil. Some might find this overwhelming; I have never been overwhelmed by duck fat. They serve a terrific Little Gem salad with diced cucumbers, under snowfalls of grated Keen’s cheddar and a dressing heavy with the waft of lovage. Sadly, not everything is like this. The cooking reminds me of some local amateur choral society where the sopranos are magnificent and always punch through joyously, but the tenors are just a bit ropey and sad. Take their fried chicken. It’s a single thigh for £6. Bizarrely, they’ve removed the skin, which is an offence against the vengeful gods of fried chicken. What happens when you batter a skinless piece of chicken? The batter just slides straight off, like it’s an insect shedding its carapace. It comes on a deep green herby emulsion, which in turn is on a piece of monogrammed paper. The paper quickly turns to torn rags in the bowl. I admire the preparation of a piece of aged duck, but it arrives with a quenelle of confit duck leg that is a gummy mulch. There’s a truly terrible dish of undercooked aubergine, with a bland buttermilk dressing that tastes of very little. Desserts, while Instagram-ready, amount to artful splodges of foams and quenelles of sorbet. The nearest thing to structure is an iced parfait under a crisp white chocolate dome. Unfortunately, the parfait is flavoured with lavender. We are firmly in aged, slack-elastic, knicker-drawer territory. There are other issues, including a cheery waiter who firmly declines to use a paper and pen to take our order despite being invited to do so. That might explain why we are brought a beetroot dish we didn’t ask for. We send it away. We are told that everything will arrive when it’s ready, which is odd because they happily serve those tasting menus in a specific order. It’s also annoying. Things land at weird times, like the chips, which arrive late with the salad, not with the snacks among which they are listed. And while they say everything is for sharing, the table is too small for the number of plates that arrive at once. Our waiter gets a little agitated when we decline to order the bread, as if we’ve committed some great faux pas. Finally, there’s the baffling wine list. The Old World whites start with something cheerfully drinkable from Slovenia for a chunky £32 before leaping majestically, to an English Pinot Gris at £60. There is nothing in between. Prinks might well be in order. When I booked, I was required to choose a menu and specified the new à la carte, but right from the off they are pushing the tasting menus, which still come with £19 worth of supplements. I got the impression that, for all their proclamations of informality and relaxed vibes and good times, their heart’s really not in the whole à la carte thing. Certainly, they’re not very good at it. They want to be a tasting menu restaurant. That’s their thing. Fair enough. If they can find the punters willing to cough up the big wedge, that’s really what they should stick with. News bites Surrey has just become home to its first food hall, with the opening of Epsom Social. The space, on Epsom Square, has seating for 200 people and eight vendors including the Venezuelan street food outlet Pabellon, the Indian Curry On Naanstop as well as food offerings representing Lebanon, Mexico and Korea. There will also be a series of popups (epsomsocial.com). And news of a closure: it’s farewell to The Glasshouse which has been feeding the neighbourhood in Kew, west London since 1999. The restaurant, which is owned by chef Bruce Poole and restaurateur Nigel Platts-Martin, has held a Michelin star since 2002, most recently under head chef Gregory Wellman. He will move to be head chef at sister restaurant La Trompette in Chiswick after the last service on 17 September. And finally, a disappointed reader got in touch recently. A year ago, she booked a table for lunch at Simon Rogan’s L’Enclume in Cumbria, which won its third Michelin star in February. When she booked, the lunchtime menu was £100 a head. A month ahead of her booking she was contacted to be told that the lunch menu had been scrapped and the evening menu, which had gone up from £195 to £250, had been introduced in its place. ‘We can’t afford that,’ my correspondent said. ‘Not sure I’d want to anyway, so have cancelled the booking.’ This was ‘a difficult decision for Simon and the team to implement,’ a spokesperson for L’Enclume told me. ‘But necessary in light of inflation.’ Email Jay at jay.rayner@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @jayrayner1','https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/sep/04/jay-rayner-restaurant-review-lerpwl-liverpool-they-are-pushing-the-tasting-menus','Jay Rayner','L3 4AD',-2.99138093000000004,53.3993911700000083,0.0);
INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(58,'2022-09-11T05:00:24Z','Etles Uyghur, London: ‘You’ll be well fed, and learn a little along the way’ – restaurant review','Etles Uyghur Restaurant, 424 Finchley Road, London NW2 2HY (020 7431 5698). Starters £7.50-£9.99, mains £12.50-£16, big plate chicken £30, desserts £4.50. Unlicensed The menu at Etles Uyghur restaurant, located at the leafier Golders Green end of London’s Finchley Road, is not just a thrilling list of edible promises. It’s also a subtle lesson in physical and human geography. Obviously, there’s no pork listed because of the predominantly Muslim culture of the Uyghur people, which the Chinese government has been attempting to annihilate so brutally, for so long. Nor is there much in the way of fish because Xinjiang province, home to the Uyghurs, is far from the sea. Here it’s all about beef, lamb and chicken. Even without knowing exactly where Xinjiang is on the map, we can assume it’s in northern China because of the wheat culture, represented by the bootlace-thick leghmen noodles and flat breads and beautifully pleated manta dumplings. Generally in China, it’s rice to the south, wheat to the north. Those manta dumplings, along with the skewers of spice-dusted meats and a mercimek or lentil soup, provide another clue. There may be a few Chinese crowd-pleasers like mapo tofu and kung pao chicken available here. But those other dishes locate this food in China’s northwestern borderlands, where the membrane between cultures is at its most porous, waving in the flavours and influences of the Turks and Central Asia. Quite so. Owners and chefs Mukaddes Yadikar and her husband, Ablikim Rahman, are indeed Turkic Muslim Uyghurs from Yili, close to China’s border with Kazakhstan. Geography plays another part in this review, although in a rather more banal, inexcusably pathetic way. For a long time it was hard to find this food in the capital, beyond the broad offering at the lovely Silk Road in Camberwell, famed for its soupy big plate chicken. Then in 2017 Yadikar and Rahman chose Walthamstow in northeast London for the original Etles, the word for the region’s ornate silks. I read lots of enthusiastic reports online, but the fact is I’m a repugnant, prejudiced south Londoner. I have gone to the very north of Scotland to review restaurants and to obscure bits of rural England where the map is probably stamped with the words “here be dragons”. But Walthamstow? The other end of the Victoria line? Don’t be absurd. Then recently I noticed this second outpost, in what was once my northwest London adolescent stomping ground. The Finchley Road? That I could do. You should, too. The great value food manages to be both exciting and nurturing at the same time. On a warm, late-summer’s evening the doors are thrown open to the street. Inside the brightly lit dining room, hung with dashing Uyghur textiles, the mood is very much of a community space into which you have been invited. There are few other diners tonight, but soon a family group arrives and are kissed and hugged by the owner and ushered to the back where clearly friends of the house eat. An outrageously cute gurgling baby is dandled on various knees, because it takes a village or at the very least, a restaurant. In the way of cultures that understand the need to make the most of what you have, offal plays a sizable part here. Cold starters at about £8 include plates of both spiced beef tripe and tongue. Usually, they have skewers of kidney, dusted with cumin and chilli, but not today. Instead, we have the lamb skewers, hot off the grill, the fat still crunchy and warm. We have more lamb, this time minced with onion and wrapped in the soft embrace of pillowy dumplings the colour of old, white piano keys. They come with a dark, grainy dipping sauce full of ground spice. Our waiter looks doubtful when I order the stir-fried tripe. Am I sure? Yes, I’m sure and please ignore the way my companion over there is recoiling. She doesn’t know what the hell she’s missing. I love this stuff. This is not one of those tripe dishes that manages somehow to disguise its true nature. The pretty ribbons of hexagonal cow stomach may have been pelted with chilli bean paste and fried fiercely with lots of chopped peppers, but they still retain their joyous, offally funk. What’s the point of ordering tripe if it doesn’t taste like tripe? My companion is much happier with their thick, slurpy, hand-pulled noodles, stir-fried with pieces of beef, spring onions and sesame seeds. Like most of the mains it costs £14 and is comfort food for a stormy day or a quiet day or any damn day. It is a plate of carbohydrate-boosted, savoury, reassuring joy. And then there is the big-plate chicken. It costs £30, which sounds like relatively big money until a platter the size of a monster truck hubcap arrives. It is so very huge, in so very many ways. There are hunks of long braised chicken and big pieces of potato cooked to that point where they start to crumble away into the rich chilli-spiked liquor. Dig deeper and you’ll find frilly ribbons of hand-cut noodles. This dish is thick and sustaining, as if engineered with a harsh wind off the Mongolian steppe in mind. We attack it enthusiastically, but still have to request takeaway containers. We fill two each for our loved ones at home, who will now love us even more. Desserts are homemade, just not in this particular home. They have a lovely Turkish lady who makes the flaky, syrup-drenched baklava, we’re told, and a Russian lady who makes the multi-layered honey cake. They don’t serve alcohol, but have a corkage-free, bring-your-own policy. The bottle of Chablis I brought ends up feeling like a poncey affectation, which it is; I’m not much of a beer drinker, but it would be so much more the thing. Just make sure to buy it in advance. The surrounding strip is short on useful shops unless you want a quartz inlay kitchen work surface. The Uyghurs are too often in our minds only because of the genocidal crimes being committed against them by the Chinese government. It helps, I think, to gain an edge of an understanding of the deep culture that’s being persecuted. One of the best ways to do that is always through food, because how and what we eat defines us. So go to Etles. Order the big-plate chicken. You’ll be well fed, and learn a little along the way. News bites The Eat Well MCR collective, a group of chefs and organisations across Manchester that provides up to 1,000 meals a week to people in poverty, is staging a harvest festival next Sunday, 18 September. The ‘feast’ in Platt Fields Park, Fallowfield, will be cooked by chefs Mary-Ellen McTague, Issy Jenkins and Beth Hammond and will use a mixture of gleaned produce from local farms as well as ingredients from local allotments and growers. Tickets are £42 (eatwellmcr.org). The academic and writer Dr Anna Sulan Masing is launching a new podcast in partnership with the US-based Whetstone Radio Collective, tracing identity, nostalgia and colonial history through specific ingredients. The first 10-part series tells the global story of pepper and tracks the narrative back to Masing’s family farm in Borneo and forward to her home in London, with many stop-offs en route. Taste of Place is available where ever you get your podcasts. Further evidence that we apparently don’t just want dinner when we go out to a restaurant comes with news of the opening next month of Fairgame in London’s Canary Wharf. It’s described by the Big Hospitality website as an ‘immersive, adult-only competitive socialising concept’ that will partner a bunch of food outlets with the opportunity to play whac-a-mole, duck shoot and… no I’m sorry, I can’t go on typing this stuff.

A dream being as far as such things go for most sane people, after weighing up the costs, the sacrifices and the ever-present danger of a visit from a fractious Kevin “McLoud”. Occasionally, however, people do make that leap, and something magical happens. Updown, by Ruth Leigh and Oli Brown, is set in seven-and-a-half acres, with well-tended walled gardens and, now, a restaurant with seven rooms for overnight stays. Presently, there’s only an outdoor dining area with a pergola, meaning you can eat john dory with samphire or pork chop with fennel gratin among the butterflies. Next year, however, an indoor space will open in the barn. Updown, which was bought and renovated over lockdown, is deeply antagonistic to those of us who can barely change a lightbulb, because somehow Leigh and Brown have taken this Grade II-listed building and created one of those quintessentially British, rural settings that matches how American screenwriters believe we all live: endless days perusing dusty, arty tomes in our boldly painted libraries, padding about in our bohemian country piles, wellies at the back door, before lunching on a plate of local radishes with sea salt and butter and a glass of cloudy, homemade lemonade. I didn’t drink that, by the way – I chose a Crodino, which is possibly the most elegant, delicious, non-alcoholic aperitif in existence: it’s a vivid orange, sweet, herbal, Italian drink that comes in a classy little bottle. It’s rarely available in the UK, so of course they have it at Updown, just casually sitting there on the menu, alongside the chilled eau de vie de poire and vodka martinis that they serve with a smoked eel gilda; they also do Whitstable Bay Blonde lager and chilled organic Clos Des Trois Sources rosé at £9 a glass. Chef Oli previously founded Duck Duck Goose in Brixton after working with the great Rowley Leigh at Le Café Anglais, while front-of-house Ruth (who just happens to be Leigh’s daughter) has worked with highly respected restaurateurs Stevie Parle and Henry Harris. Updown, regardless of how casually off-the-cuff it seems, is no flimsy operation. The vibe is intensely relaxed, but service is well drilled and attentive, staffed by local young people who restore faith in the whole notion of British hospitality. Lord knows where Brown and Leigh found these chipper, clever, non-obtrusive but ever-present types in freshly pressed shirts, but they’ve hit gold. Of course, all this would be worth nothing if the food was lacklustre, but it’s good. Extremely good. The menu is brief and ever-changing, cooking whatever is local, fresh and seasonal over an outdoor wood fire. On the Sunday we visited, there was a plate of excellent ripe tomatoes served with equally juicy peaches and basil, which, when written down like that, sounds both perilously simple and possibly unpleasant, but that is the alchemy of using the best ingredients. Suddenly, it all makes sense. The same goes for a bowl of courgettes, sauteed until almost collapsing, with a soft, pale ball of fine mozzarella. Main courses included a Sunday roast of lamb with just-podded broad beans and tempura courgette and a side of baby potatoes with grilled endive. For vegetarians, there was a ferociously portioned plate of roast celeriac, girolles and tomatoes with thick, green, luscious pesto and excellent olive oil, though the star of that particular show was an abundance of large, soft chickpeas prepared with love and care. Presentation is unfussy, and at times even delightfully clumsy, because it is all about the flavours. Pudding was a choice between an indecently boozy baba with crimson cherries backstroking for their lives in a sea of rum and flanked by chantilly cream, and truffled Baron Bigod cheese with walnuts and honey. Updown hasn’t really got going yet, so I’m possibly jumping the gun by even discussing it now, but I have a hunch that diners will quickly warm to it, and that bookings to sit in the barn, once it’s up and running, will be buoyant. This is one of those places that shows how life could be lived – so long as you’re someone who has their act together. You’d be classy but understated, living a rustic existence in seven or so acres with its own wildflower garden, and existing on good, simple produce. That’s the brilliant thing about the very best restaurants: they make you lunch and sell you a fantasy. At Updown, while you personally may not be to the manor born, from noon until late afternoon, you can sit back, drink gingerella and eat octopus salad in the sunshine, and, for a few short hours at least, it feels very much as if you are. Updown, Updown Road, Betteshanger, near Deal, Kent, 01304 784410. Currently open only Fri 5-11pm and Sun noon-6pm (as well as Thurs-Sun dinner for hotel guests); opening fully in early 2023.

Snacks and small plates £7.50-£22, large plates £16-£40, desserts £9-£16, wines from £36 Early on in our dinner at Fallow on London’s Haymarket, a waiter delivers a mushroom parfait to our table and then points up at a shelf suspended from the industrially scaffolded ceiling. Gnarled, fungally embellished logs are sitting up there. “And we even grow some of the mushrooms for this dish right here at the restaurant,” he says. Even allowing for the restaurant’s noisily proclaimed commitment to sustainability, this could be a profoundly annoying outbreak of virtue signalling, were it not for one thing. That mushroom parfait is astonishing. The furious blizzard of shitake and oyster is as smooth as velvet stroked the right way. It’s as deep as a Samuel Beckett play, and as rich as Rockefeller. It surprises me not at all that dairy has been involved, along with separated eggs: yolks for the fat, whipped whites for the aeration. It is glorious to eat but could also, I think, replace my Kiehl’s Facial Fuel habit as a moisturiser; just rub it in and keep rubbing. Astonishingly though, I believe it is pound for pound more expensive than the Kiehl’s. I like to think that the £17 price tag for this small plate of mushroom pâté is partly to recoup the significant research and development costs, like it was some new pharmaceutical. Certainly, it makes me feel better about the world. So no, Fallow is not cheap, but it really is all kinds of “Gosh” and “Wow” and “Oh my!” Chefs Jack Croft and Will Murray met at Dinner by Heston, which is interesting because prior to their mushroom parfait, the best I’d tried had been the vegetarian alternative to Blumenthal’s famed meat fruit. This really is better (and, as it happens, cheaper). The two chefs bonded over a desire to elevate the humble and use the bits that others throw away. An extended pop-up led eventually last autumn to this hard-edged corner site: there are polished floors and red leather banquettes, marble counters and, dangling from the ceiling, bundles of kelp and heather. In the open kitchen, flames leap. On one of those excruciatingly hot evenings the glass walls have been pulled back and there is a tumble and buzz about the place. It reminds me of those New York restaurants which reject the arch formality and curtsying of the sort that usually frames cooking of this quality, preferring instead to knock out plate after plate of the good stuff. Some of it is delivered by the extremely knowledgable waiters, the rest by the chefs themselves. One particular strength is seasonings. Slices of corn cob, curled in on themselves from a long swim in the deep fat fryer that has made the kernels almost toffee-like, come dusted with a salty-sour kombu-boosted mix. It is a bar snack wearing a zoot suit and spats, to be eaten as if they were baby-back ribs. A similarly addictive salty-sour seasoning has been used on long-smoked beef short ribs, in a sauce overcoat, that come away from the bone with a tug of the teeth. Intriguingly, two fat ribs are only £12, which is not far off the retail price. Yes, the pricing can seem a little uneven at times. Among these early dishes there is a “tartiflette” flatbread. It’s a pillowy, heat-inflated disc of crisp crusted brioche laden with slabs of reblochon cheese, caramelised onions and cornichon: all the ingredients, bar the potatoes, that the reblochon trade body came up with when looking for a dish with which to flog their product back in the 80s. Next comes picked white crab on a crunchy salad of shredded cabbage. Underneath is a smooth purée of jerusalem artichoke. Poured around this heap of loveliness is a toasty chilli broth. Do try their take on leeks vinaigrette which, unlike the classic, is served warm. The logs of leek have been smoked until soft. The dish is encouragingly drenched in a thick vinaigrette then topped with fried breadcrumbs. It’s a hefty portion, as it should be for £22, to be shared and fought over with friends. The menu is strong on non-meat dishes like this, although it does have a list of cuts from one-time dairy cows; animals that have given their all to the milk business and finally given their all once again. If you don’t approve of dairy or meat eating, none of this narrative will change your mind. But the idea of animals which have served in one way, being served in another makes sense. The dish that has garnered most attention and which will split the crowd is the cod’s head with sriracha butter sauce. It’s as described: a cod’s head, the bit of the fish that might otherwise be thrown away, eye intact, slow-grilled until the skin has taken on a sweet chewiness, then drenched in a tangerine-coloured sauce with the light kick of chilli and garlic. You are invited to pick around to find the meat – not just the familiar cheeks, but those bits around the jawline and the eye socket and beyond. I find myself feeling about my own well-upholstered face. There really might be some good eating there. There are two views here: this is either the very worst of overwrought London restaurant hipsterism, or there’s the opinion of those who have tried it which is that it’s a bloody good, delicious and totally involving idea. Of the desserts the best of those we try is a tart deep-filled with a copper-coloured crème made with whey that has been slowly caramelised over almost three days. Essentially, it’s a grown-up version of condensed milk. A chocolate mousse with various bits of mushroom and black truffle feels like the kitchen becoming a little too clever for its own good. I find myself muttering the word “interesting” over it. That’s never a good thing. My only other criticism is of the comprehensive wine list, which starts at £36 a bottle and has nothing below £9 a glass. It makes the entry point for an already less-than-cheap restaurant unnecessarily more expensive. It is possible to find good wines at less excruciating prices for those on a budget. This aside, Fallow really is serving some of the best food I’ve tried in London right now. The sustainability stuff is great. Let’s put the mushroom show on, right here in the barn. Let’s use the bits others chuck away. But none of that matters if your pricey dinner isn’t memorable. At Fallow, it really is. News bites Chef Adam Reid of The French at the Midland Hotel in Manchester has announced a new, rather less fancy venture in the city. The Butty Shop will be a take-away food outlet at the redeveloped New Century Hall, a self-styled ‘social destination’ inside a Grade II listed building on Mayes Street. Reid’s all-day menu will apparently focus on traditional sandwiches. It plans ‘to bring the British butty back to life, with classic Northern flavours built on the memories of childhood visits to the bakery.’ There will be pickled eggs. At adam-reid.co.uk. The Brazilian chef Alberto Landgraf, who holds a brace of Michelin stars at Oteque in Rio de Janeiro, is bringing his food back to London, where he started his career with the likes of Gordon Ramsay and Tom Aikens. Landgraf, whose menu is particularly focused on both seafood and open fire cooking, will launch Bossa on Vere Street, in a space beneath the Brazilian consulate. And commiserations with Cardiff, which is to get an Ivy Asia, serving its peculiar menu of vaguely Japanese-inspired dishes, inside the St David’s shopping centre. In the summer of 2021, Ivy owner Richard Caring had to delete a promotional video for his new Chelsea Ivy Asia and apologise for ‘any offence caused’ by what were denounced by various groups as racial stereotypes. That said, Ivy Asia in Manchester still has a space for private dining called the Geisha Room.

Although it’s not exactly Soho, but rather that point where it melds into the lower half of Oxford Street. This is where Hare Krishna parades weave past American breakfast cereal boutiques and where, if you stand long enough, the world and his dog will pass by on the way to buy a pair of Primark flip-flops. Soho itself is especially staggy and henny these days, so any attempt to reach Firebird via Piccadilly Circus means you’ll encounter at least three groups of Grand National jockeys and a silent disco walking tour twirling ebulliently to Europe’s The Final Countdown. Somewhere in the midst of all this chaos is Firebird, an elegant new restaurant opened by Madina Kazhimova and Anna Dolgushina, one of whom you will probably meet the moment you step into the calm, rather dark interior. From the outset, the place feels personal and homespun, which is a rarity in London restaurants at the moment, because only the big, bolshie and slightly sterile openings seem to find the wings to fly. Firebird pushes itself as a restaurant and natural wine/biodynamic bar, but don’t let that deter you; they also offer drinks that aren’t Berocca-wee-orange or redolent of athlete’s foot. They were doing a charred pineapple daiquiri and a smoked bellini highball the night we were there, although Charles went for a potent toasted sesame sour. If those cocktails sound as if they’ve been in contact with some sort of naked flame, you’re close to guessing the concept behind Firebird. Yes, fire. Almost everything on ex-Caravan head chef Nikos Kontongiannatos’ menu is “touched by flames”, having been cooked over charcoal or wood. I thought that might be something of an exaggeration, but, in Firebird’s case, it has legs. We ate at the sit-up bar (not the best seats in the house, but I’d booked rather late), so had a full view of the fire as whole grilled sea bass with acqua pazza headed for other tables. Then hunks of halloumi, charred and crisp on the sides, sticky and sweet in the centre, arrived glistening with honey and truffle, and I realised that Firebird was really rather good. In fact, it’s probably better than 90% of the places I have frittered my time on this year. The standard of cooking, matched with genuinely intriguing and appetising dishes, puts it right up there on my list of 2022’s important openings. Take the choux bun filled with earthy, chicken-liver paté and hazelnut, a sort of bizarre, offally Paris-Brest. It sounds heinous, but it works. Or the tiger prawns in a heavenly, rich, white-wine-and-butter sauce – well, more like a soup, because there was so much of it. Glazed pork belly, from the mains, appeared with obvious evidence of the fire, with its crackling firm and its flesh still pink, and came armed with a warm potato salad and a blob of plum ketchup. For vegans, there was “primo cabbage”, charred but soft and yielding, with a good, punchy hazelnut romesco sauce. Never in all my years judging MasterChef has anyone served me scallops on a bed of buttery mash with truffle, but at Firebird they’re about setting the rulebook alight. The scallops were enormous, plump, soft and a little torched, as one might by now expect here. By 8pm, Firebird was filled to the brim, and wannabe walk-ins were being batted off with charming diplomacy. Part of its magic lies in how they have an abundance of trained staff, all with an eye on your empty glass, missing fork or desire to see the dessert menu, a level of service that’s rarer than hen’s dentures right now. Each time my napkin was refolded, it felt like a cuddle. I was so excited by the short pudding list that we ordered both, as well as a banana baked old fashioned cocktail in celebration. That evening’s offerings included a pâte à choux filled with whipped cream, strawberries and chunks of honeycomb, littered with pistachio and drizzled with a puddle of honey: pure calorific art. The other option was a small, damp, slightly boozy chunk of coffee cake in a sticky, sweet sauce and liberally covered in praline cream and nuts. It was less pretty to look at, true, but it packed more of a punch. As much thought had been put into the sweet course as the starters and mains, which is almost an outdated concept in the capital these days. This place is one to have up your sleeve for when you need a little class, kindness and sustenance in a postcode that, since restrictions lifted, has quickly shifted back to booze-fuelled party central. I’m a fan. Though my waistline could probably do without any more of those gorgeous, imaginative desserts, I’m like a plump-bottomed moth to Firebird’s flames. Firebird 29 Poland Street, London W1, 07713 737813. Open Mon-Fri 5-11pm, Sat noon-11pm. From about £50 a head, plus drinks and service.

Snacks and starters £4-£10, mains £17-£24, desserts £6, wines from £24 In the brutal depths of a cost-of-living crisis, when some people still have money for the cream on the top and far too many do not even have enough for the basics underneath, going for dinner in a space that was once a bank could be spun as brutally symbolic. Here is a former financial institution, still servicing those with enough filthy lucre to invest in a rich return, only in different ways. There’s a joke in here somewhere about pork-based restaurants trading mammon for gammon, but I do have my pride. The point is that anybody with a scintilla of humanity should feel uncomfortable about being financially fine while so many others are not. Then again, we are all capable of holding two thoughts in our head at once. We can be appalled by the current economic situation, overseen by cowards and intellectual lightweights more interested in their own greasy, suppurating parliamentary careers than the wellbeing of the people they are meant to serve. But we can also wonder whether the Palmerston in Edinburgh is a nice place to go for dinner. It is, by the way. We’ll get there in a moment. Certainly, the last thing the economy needs right now is for people who can afford to do so, to no longer spend their money. Allowing more restaurants to go out of business because of a very British strain of middle-class embarrassment, only putting more people out of work while depriving food and drink producers of income, is not a route out of recession. It’s a route deeper into it. And if you still think the restaurant business is some sort of rip-off, pursued by get-rich-quick merchants, perhaps you’d like to have a crack at it yourself. Sure, there are con artists in hospitality. There are in all sectors. But for the vast majority, the struggle is the same as for everyone else. They are faced by spiralling energy, food and labour costs that have to be recouped so they can stay afloat and make it to the other side. So I’m going to repeat the other argument for former banks, a resource with which Edinburgh seems uncommonly blessed. As I pointed out earlier this year when I reviewed Double Dragon, they make fabulous dining rooms. The former Bank of Scotland building on St Andrew Square has recently opened as the Gleneagles Townhouse and boasts a restaurant, the Spence, full of vault and cornice and grandeur. It’s practically next door to another former banking hall, which in 2018 opened as Edinburgh’s outpost of Hawksmoor. And now, on the other side of the city’s heart, there’s the Palmerston, occupying a corner site that was also once a bank. The floors are partly laid with polished wood, partly tiled in black and white. There are walls of olive green and handsome globe lights and huge portrait windows. It’s a big sturdy room for serving big sturdy dishes. The food is solid, comforting and beautifully executed and puts satisfaction a little way ahead of drop-dead gorgeousness. The Palmerston is also a bakery and going by the crunchy-crusted sourdough that exercises the molars encouragingly, a very good one. The restaurant, which takes its name from its address, opened last year, and is a partnership between Australian-born Lloyd Morse, who previously cooked at London’s Spring, and Edinburgh native James Snowdon who was formerly the general manager of Fulham’s Harwood Arms. It proclaims a profound interest in working with local farmers, using as much of the animal as possible and only serving what’s good right now. The result is a constantly changing menu; the photographs taken a few days after my visit may not therefore represent exactly what I had, but you’ll get the idea. I can only feel deep love for a menu that starts with a big plate of puffed crispy pig skin, like giant Quavers but served hot, spice-dusted and lightly vinegared. The night we are there, they are offering a suet pie of hogget and bacon with buttered cabbage to share for £33. Only the imperative to eat more than one main course between us stops me going for it. There is roast chicken for two or three with chips and béarnaise at £45, or a whole mackerel with tomatoes, capers and parsley. It’s the best sort of well-written menu; one that makes you imagine yourself eating all those dishes, with a greedy sigh. Not all of it is dependent on the animal. Among the starters there’s a hugely satisfying plate of both green beans and newly podded broad beans, like shimmering emeralds peeking through, with pickled red onion, the crunch of walnuts and a thick dusting of pecorino. Then again, there’s also a salad of pickled tripe, a neglected ingredient which, prepared properly, deserves all the love. It is both meaty and bouncy and comes with dripping-fried croutons, dinky boats of little gem and a dressing of mustard and crème fraîche. For the main there is ox liver, fiercely fried until crusted without but soft and wobbly inside, with prunes and chips and a rocket salad. Or have a slab of their slow roasted Texel lamb, a beautiful shade of cotton candy pink, with borlotti beans and piles of peperonata, arranged in the deep well of the plate, as if trying to contain the joy. These dishes are also properly sauced, as if determined to ensure moppage with any sourdough that hasn’t already been used as a vehicle for the salty whipped butter. And oh joy, there’s a list of familiar-sounding wines, which appears to have been designed to enable drinking rather than exploring. Sometimes – sod it, most of the time – I don’t want my horizons expanded, I just want a nice glass of crisp white. That’s what I get: a bottle of arneis from Elvio Tintero. I liked it so much I took a detailed note. The charming waiter said it had a creamy end. I’m not going to argue. The Palmerston supplies other restaurants in the city with bread and more proof of that baking skill comes with the desserts: a properly wobbly custard tart with a dollop of crème fraîche to brighten things up, and a deeply soothing gooseberry roulade with its own custard pond. I’m a big fan of custard ponds. It’s a great dessert. It’s a great dinner. It’s also the best time I’ve had in a former banking hall in a very long time. News bites Asma Khan’s much-loved Darjeeling Express will be opening its new London location later in the year. Meanwhile they have launched a pop up at the Pembroke pub on the Old Brompton Road. Alongside bigger dishes like their methi chicken, there is a list of toasties, including a chilli cheese toastie with green chutney and a chicken kebab toastie (darjeeling-express.com). Chef Michael Shaw is to open a new high-end Japanese restaurant on Manchester’s Bridge Street in October, complete with video walls. Musu, which roughly translates from the Japanese as ‘infinite possibilities’, will have à la carte and multi-course kaiseki choices as well as an omakase option served at a six-seater counter. Interestingly, MUSU is also a sometime abbreviation for Manchester University Students’ Union, which could result in a very different night out.

There was a point during the meal when an apparently untrained server loomed towards me with a bowl of Sicilian red prawn tagliatelle, which had fallen over on to one side of the dish on its journey from kitchen to table, so all the chef’s pretty plating arrangement was ruined. “Yes,” I thought, “this is exactly where we are now.” Not that the clumsy misplacement of this fresh tagliatelle in a rich, vibrant, tomato sauce – not exactly brimming with plump prawns, but enough to make a meaningful mark – spoiled the taste. No, it would be very princess and the pea of me to grumble about that. Still, I do wish all the hospitality people who took a break during the pandemic would come back. I miss you guys. You were ace. Noci is a casual Italian restaurant on that pretty, green part of Islington’s Upper Street, the bit with the Waterstones and Bellanger brasserie, and handy for tourists to see everything the area has to offer. It’s a fantastic location for the Business Design Centre crowd, and for after-workers wanting dinner before jumping on the 73 bus home. Once you step inside, it is vast, family-friendly and has menu pricing that makes my eyes only semi-roll in astonishment, which is increasingly rare. “The pasta mains are quite, um, small,” a different server informed me as I perused the £14.50 lamb ravioli. “They come in 100g portions.” It’s a mistake to tell anyone who knows their way around the 1980s Weight Watchers pamphlet that you serve pasta in 100g portions. We can visualise this in our mind’s eye, and know that 100g is that abstemious serving we permitted ourselves when 300g would have been just the ticket. Even so, I chose to visit Noci partly because its pricing felt relatively sane compared with many other restaurants at the moment. For finer dining, we are now in the era of £250-plus-a-deposit tasting menus, with extra up front for “incidentals” – pay it or buzz off. Fine dining, I fear, will soon be only for multimillionaires, so places such as Noci are vital. (That said, I’d rather be down the Binley Mega Chippy than eat nine courses in a room filled with angel investors and hedge-fund managers for a £300 minimum entry fee.) The main thing that drew me to Noci, however, was chef Louis Korovilas and the silk handkerchief pasta with walnuts for which he became known while running the kitchen at the very good Bancone in Covent Garden. It is a simple yet compelling dish. At Noci, for now at least, it comes with asparagus, but all the vital tenets of the original are there: the confit egg yolk sits atop, still giving enough to burst over firm, jagged-cut sheets of pasta, and all in some sort of walnut butter sauce. It is simply irresistible. It is also sort of unavoidable, because there are only seven pastas on the mains and even fewer starters, though, conveniently, even shovel hands, our server, couldn’t destroy their architecture en route from the kitchen. The calorie count on the menu helpfully points out that those handkerchiefs contain 734 cal. Thank you so much, Boris. We were almost enjoying ourselves for a moment there. Our third bowl of pasta was the trendy-four-years-ago cacio e pepe ziti, a glorious bowl of fat, slippery tubes in a buttery, cheesy ocean made lively with a lot of black pepper. This dish always delivers – it’s posh macaroni cheese with a Clarendon Instagram filter, but wonderful nevertheless. By this point, the restaurant had filled for Saturday lunchtime, but very little food seemed to be leaving the kitchen. The gap between our starters and mains had been arduous, and those starters were rather forgettable, anyway: seared tuna had, puzzlingly, been grilled on only one side, while burrata with wild garlic lacked any wow. The best was the hot, crisp gorgonzola torta fritta, which is samosa-like in shape and filled with taleggio, leeks and walnuts. Post-pasta, however, something told me that the path to pudding would not be plain sailing. We had slipped into customer obscurity by this point, and hadn’t even been offered another drink after the first one, which now seems commonplace after the first check-back. Eventually, we ordered the chocolate and hazelnut budino, which was the alternative to panna cotta or three types of whipped gelato. We waited and waited, before eventually being told that our dessert wasn’t ready and was in the fridge somewhere “setting”. The bill, including one kombucha and a glass of wine, was £72. My Noci experience is symbolic of a lot of my eating out nowadays: functional, occasionally delicious, sometimes slapdash and lacking any pizazz. I am rapidly losing reasons to leave the house.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(66,'2022-04-29T11:00:38Z','Dai Chi, London W1: ‘Delightfully odd’ – restaurant review | Grace Dent on restaurants','Any restaurant with a “concept” makes me slightly nervous. “Do you understand the concept?” I’ve been asked many times over the years. Sometimes, if the staff are being jollier, it’s merely a “Have you dined with us before?” as a lead-up to explaining that everything is served “family-style”, “in no particular order” or “is made only from things rescued from bins”; in one place, I was allowed my next course only after I’d indicated I’d finished my current one by holding up a specific paper flag on a cocktail stick. Thankfully, Dai Chi’s only concept is that almost all its dishes come on skewers, Japanese kushiage-style (ie, pub food). That said, most of these skewers are deep-fried and often breadcrumbed, so they’re instead describing the restaurant as a kushikatsu, which is big in Osaka. At Dai Chi, that means you get the likes of a single, top-quality black Iberiko tomato, breadcrumbed, on a skewer, with one meaningful anchovy draped over the top. Please eat it all in one go, chomp, down the hatch, because any attempt to nibble on it will result in some serious mopping of your décolletage. Another notable skewer is a large, breaded eringi mushroom with a solo carabinero on top. There are non-skewered items, too, and all are just as delicious – and brief: a titchy tuna tobiko taco and a winter leaf filled with burrata and dotted with wobbly, pink salmon roe. You can plump for the £38, six-course omakase menu or go rogue on the à la carte, which would involve attempting to work out how many skewers you need of each item to ensure that dinner feels like it actually happened. I watched, with some anxiety, as other tables tried to do just this, and it made me wonder if kushikatsu isn’t perhaps better suited to informal picking and sipping in a bar, rather than to a proper dinner in a fancy restaurant. Mind you, every time I quibbled about something or other, another mouthful of something gorgeous on a stick turned up and I couldn’t fault the love, care and skill at play. One of the first courses, a small plate of hamachi (amberjack) with truffle soy and furikake, came garnished with delicate shiso flower and was one of the loveliest, most fragrant, moreish plates of this particular fish I’ve ever had. A second course was a tiny segment of glossy Hokkaido milk bun with two slices of sweet, especially good tomato. The presentation is artistic, alluring and makes picking up the item in question and dispatching it in two bites feel almost crass. Dai Chi is the second London restaurant from the people behind Angelina in Dalston, where the concept is Japan meets Italy – mortadella with nasu dengaku, say, or crab with wasabi tobiko. From the outset, Angelina has been quietly respected for slightly skew-whiff notions that it pulls off with aplomb – you’d never call these people boring. At Dai Chi, the mood is similarly delightfully odd. I arrived to Summertime by DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince blaring out across the room, which then merged into Don’t Break My Heart by UB40. There are far too few floor staff, and no non-alcoholic options on the cocktail list, despite them stocking a lovely array of ginger, plum and peppercorn shrubs. Moreover, once we’d had our first round of drinks, there was no further offer of any more. Then again, all the front-of-house were spending an awful lot of time at each table, hand-holding customers through the concept. By the time we were five courses into the omakase, I began to feel that I was destined to be slightly hungry by the end. Charles, on the other hand, has one of those ever-present hungers that makes me feel as if I’m living with an anthropomorphised, coal-burning locomotive that constantly needs new bags of fuel shovelled into its ever-demanding furnace. Seven skewers and some sashimi with petals is an amuse-bouche for his type of appetite; yes, even though one of those skewers featured the most incredibly tender tuna, crumbed and dotted with wasabi, and another – and the star of the entire show – breaded aged beef showered with sea salt. At this point, you could elect to add Kagoshima wagyu with wasabi onion ponzu for an extra £55 for two, but I found that out only after analysing the menu once I’d got home, because no one bothered to mention it at the time. Pudding was a slice of delightful poached pear in miso ricotta, with genuinely wonderful, rich, dreamy ricotta and an inch or so of perfectly soft, purple pear steeped in some sort of sweet wine – heaven. Dai Chi is clever, unusual, exciting and strange, and it’s offering some of the most fantastic cooking in London, although things could get very expensive for larger groups going à la carte. Like all the best things, it left me wanting more. Dai Chi 16a D’Arblay Street, London W1, 020-7734 1449. Open evenings only, Tues-Sat, 5.15-11.30pm (midnight Fri &amp; Sat).

Hot and cold meze £9-£18, platters £18-£42, desserts £8-£9, wines from £29 The Instagram accounts I follow, like the gummy jars of condiments I collect in my fridge, are a hot mess: chefs showing off what they knocked up last night; carpetbagging food “influencers” whose brass neck enthrals but doesn’t influence me; jazz pianists offering useful tips; Grace Dent, because who wouldn’t want a window on her fabulous life? By far the most entertaining is @yemelerdeyizcom, a Turkish food and drink account, which posts endless videos of just two things: lamb kebabs being made, and portioned rounds of baklava being finished and boxed. The latter are always beautiful. There’s the ladling of the steaming syrup, the shiny golden curve of the filo pastry and the brilliant green of the crushed pistachios. Watching these videos is not the most embarrassing online displacement activity for a middle-aged man, but it’s bloody close. Best to have it out there. Like the tragic rainbow chaser that I am, I had always assumed this to be the very best baklava possible: the platonic ideal of the polyamorous marriage of pistachios, filo and syrup, and one that I should aspire to experience. Then I was served the baklava at Zahter, a new restaurant off London’s Carnaby Street which re-examines the Turkish repertoire. It’s not Instagram beautiful or it may be, but in the low light it’s impossible to see. (Go check my Insta where I am @jayrayner1, and I will have posted a picture.) But by God, it’s good; so good that its gorgeousness could not be relegated to the end of this column when I might be short on space. There is none of the mouth-drying, friable confetti of overbaked filo. It is soft and luscious. Too often baklava can be cloyingly oversweet, like the maker has some side hustle knocking out insulin and is looking to recruit new customers. This is perfectly balanced so the flavour of the pistachio is also allowed its voice and, just to be on the safe side, there is a quenelle of thick cream. It is quite simply the best baklava I have ever eaten. It is a massive symphonic coda, a big thump of brass and strings at the end of a meal which, to extend a metaphor until it snaps, was big on cheery melodies and harmonies. Zahter, the Turkish name for a variety of wild thyme, occupies a tottering corner site with a cheery view of the street life outside. It is the first standalone venture from Turkish chef Esra Muslu. After training in Australia, she ran a series of restaurants in Istanbul before being recruited as head chef of Soho House in the city. From there she moved to a similar role at the company’s outpost in London’s Shoreditch and then to Ottolenghi in Spitalfields. The menu, built around both a wood and a charcoal-burning oven, is a wandering journey across Turkey. From the south make sure to order the stuffed globe artichoke. Also make sure to bring an enthusiastic friend to help you eat it. The £16 price tag looks chunky in the extreme until it arrives. It is a very large, mature flower and a victory of a day’s preparation. After simmering in acidulated water, the choke is removed, the leaves put back in place on to the heart and trimmed. While it is still warm, it is bathed in a fragrant lemony dressing. Then comes a stuffing of rice, spiced with cinnamon and allspice, lemon juice and handfuls of fresh green herbs. The stuffing is pushed in between every leaf, into every nook and cranny. Finally, it’s piled with more chopped green herbs, toasted almonds and shiny pomegranate seeds. There is a still-warm wedge of roasted lemon on the top for an extra squeeze. It’s one of those utterly engrossing and formidable dishes, which draws you in one leaf at a time. That and the baklava would make a sustaining dinner, but I understand my responsibilities. There must be more. We have an ovenware dish of tiger prawns roasted in frothing lakes of garlic butter, hefty with Aleppo pepper, which leaves juices behind that demand to be mopped away with their airy breads. We have roasted and crusted chicken livers under bales of fresh green herbs. Only a fava bean purée with grape slices that have been doused in the anise-boosted spirit raki doesn’t quite hit the spot, being overly sweet. For balance, we turn to the section of the menu headed platters, and a quite magnificent dish of dense lamb kofta with white beans, fresh red chilli and further handfuls of flat leaf, all piled on to a flat bread cheerfully absorbing the very essence of what has been shovelled on top of it. Then comes half a roasted quince, and finally that baklava with a capital B. Zahter has been open only a few weeks when I visit, and is trading into difficult circumstances, but still has a youthful buzz and assuredness to it. It feels like a mature restaurant though not, it must be said, one aimed necessarily at a mature clientele. In this week’s Observer Food Monthly my regular column is a plea for new restaurants to employ someone who is at least in their 50s to help judge the environment they are building. I can’t pretend. Everything I whinge about in that column is present here at Zahter. I do have to use my iPhone torch to read the menu. The piped music and the hard surfaces make for a clattering acoustic. The upstairs dining room is reached via vertiginous stairs. For good measure the tables are too small for the way in which the kitchen sends out the dishes all at once. We end up with our wine and water bottle on the floor next to us. If Zahter doesn’t want older gits like me in their restaurant, whining about the lighting and the sound and the table size, then fine. But there’s an issue. Zahter’s food is great. There’s also value here, but it is not cheap. The short wine list starts at £29 a bottle before heading into the 30s and beyond. As the information at the top shows, the dishes are, shall we say, boldly priced. The final £150 bill does not feel extortionate for this food and this service and this location. But perhaps turn the music down and the lights up a little so you don’t risk excluding a whole demographic who may best be able to afford it. My motives are pure. I really do want as many people as possible to enjoy that fabulous baklava.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(68,'2022-08-21T05:00:02Z','Walter’s, London: ‘So many reasons to go back’ – restaurant review','Walter’s, 84 Park Hall Road, London SE21 8BW (020 8014 8548). Snacks £3.80-£5, starters £9.50-£13, mains £19.50-£26, desserts £7-£7.50, wines from £19.50 It was when they started playing the original recording of Love Will Tear Us Apart by Joy Division that I knew I was in the right place. We’d already had the soundtracks of both The Breakfast Club and Pretty in Pink. Now it was time for a bit of melancholy post-punk with our dinner. That’s the key to a good neighbourhood restaurant. You’ve got to know the neighbourhood. The team behind Walter’s, recently opened amid the privet and spreading horse chestnut of London’s West Dulwich, clearly do. For here we all are, the comfortably paunchy middle-aged who were kids in the 80s and danced and snogged to these tunes, and who can still get a bit misty-eyed over a few bars of Don’t You (Forget About Me) by Simple Minds. Alongside these memories, played out at the dullest roar, we want a nice, creative bit of dinner without schlepping into town, and we are ready to pay properly for it if the cooking’s good and the portions don’t make you feel like a mug. At Walter’s the portions don’t make you feel like a mug. A restaurant like this will not survive on special occasions. It will only work if people keep coming back; if they store it away as a reliable promise, kept. Walter’s is that place. It’s also an intriguing case study in the post-pandemic hospitality business. Walter’s is named after Walter Hathaway, a milliner who was the first owner of this address. It belongs to Rob Hampton and Matt Lovell, the restaurateurs behind the Oystermen in Covent Garden. As the latter’s name suggests, it’s a straight-up seafood restaurant, serving uncomplicated platefuls of the good stuff from British waters; a central London bistro with relatively restrained pricing. It’s been a solid success and the reasonable assumption is that they would find a site for a follow-up, somewhere else firmly in Zone 1. Instead, here they are in the especially leafy suburbs with a totally different bistro proposition. As the pandemic lay waste to the restaurant sector, sage types suggested that all the hot action would shift from the city centres to the neighbourhoods that ring them; places exactly like this. There are still a lot of businesses taking advantage of some beneficial post-Covid leases, but if it also means the likes of Hampton and Lovell try their hands here instead, on the site of what was a Café Rouge I never visited, then I’m all for it. Because tonight, after recent reviews in Edinburgh and Swansea, Taunton and Dublin, I have simply followed the No 3 bus route 10 minutes from my south London home, to this clean-lined, half wood-panelled space, cleverly divided by rattan screens. I have a very well made, very cold margarita to drink, and a plate of fried friggitelli peppers to pick at, alongside some expertly engineered truffled arancini, while I make my choices. There’s nothing especially startling about the offer here. It’s food to oil conversation rather than become the focus of it; the sort of thing anybody who has eaten in a few restaurants over the past decade will recognise. There are four of us tonight and only five starters so we order them all. Yes please, we’ll have the duck liver parfait for the table, because the table is hungry, thank you very much. It’s glossy and rich and extremely well made, as you would expect of a kitchen led by Mateusz Gosek who has had time in significant kitchens on his CV. There are mussels in a brisk chilli broth, and hunks of braised cuttlefish in a mess of tomatoes, chorizo and chickpeas. There’s a shimmering ceviche of gilt-head bream, and a salad of tomatoes and nectarines with croutons, which is billed as a panzanella but isn’t really. It is pleasing all the same. It’s a table of “How’s yours?” and “Very nice, would you like to try some?” and “Yes please.” There’s attention to detail: the tiny balls of cucumber with the ceviche; the way the nectarines are fanned; the skinning and then pickling of the cherry tomatoes with the parfait. Main courses justify their £20-plus price tags by both execution and volume. Perhaps they’re doing themselves out of dessert orders by piling just so much glossy, velvet-red peperonata beneath that slab of crisp-skinned sea bass. And, my, that’s a fair old heap of braised lentils beneath the sizeable roasted guinea fowl. They haven’t skimped on the crushed new potatoes with the lamb rump either. Tonight, there’s a special of poussin, thickly coated in a hefty sate sauce with a proper hobnailed chilli kick, then grilled; a smart move, given how little flavour poussin brings to the party. If there’s a criticism, it’s that non-meat dishes are clearly not front and centre of anybody’s thoughts. If the main course offering pulls on the old Italian vegetarian fallbacks – a risotto say, or a pasta or, as here, a plate of gnocchi – you just know nobody is really with the project. It doesn’t matter how good those gnocchi are. They could do, they should do, better. Very much on the plus side, there’s a broad wine list that, on its first page, features two wines of the week discounted by roughly 25%. This may be because they really like the wine, or they simply bought too much and it’s not moving. But I’m a sucker for this stuff either way. A brisk bright fiano from Villa Raiano is reduced from £38 to £28; an earthy La Bioca nebbiolo is reduced from £47 to £35.25. It’s the sort of thing that will bring us back, as will the charming service. At one point our waiter overhears us discussing a much-loved but long-gone local café in Herne Hill. “Oh my,” he says. “My first job in restaurants was there. I was the kitchen porter.” It’s a small thing, but it’s also the very definition of neighbourhood. Desserts are designed for those who have made it through the mains. A lemon posset has failed to set, but I discover a taste for drinking citrussy custard. There’s a more successfully solid wedge of Basque cheesecake and a few of their ice-creams: a dollop of Eton mess, with cubes of meringue and a properly sprightly scoop of cherry. I note on the way out that they do brunch at weekends. Oh, and there’s a happy hour. You can also just come for a drink. There’s lots of reasons to go back. Given how dangerously close to my home it is, the odds of that happening are high. News bites Kevin Dalgleish, responsible for a series of food festivals in Scotland over the years attracting an impressive roster of fellow chefs, has opened a new restaurant in Aberdeen. Amuse on Queens Terrace has 70 covers. The classically inflected launch menu includes Orkney scallops with peas, bacon and mussel cider marinière, lasagne of langoustines and scallops with a shellfish bisque and a strawberry pavlova with lime and black pepper (amuse-restaurant.com). Two former chefs from Brighton’s much loved Chilli Pickle are going it alone. Indian-born Kanthi Thamma and Diego Ricaurte from Ecuador will open the small plate restaurant Palmito on the site of a former takeaway on Western Road, close to the dividing line between Brighton and Hove. The weekly changing menu will investigate the migration of spices from the Indian subcontinent via Europe to Latin America, representing the chefs’ combined heritage. Dishes will include short rib with cloves, bass with ginger and banana with chai spice. For more visit @palmito.restaurant on Instagram. The Grand in York is opening a new restaurant entitled Legacy, the word meaning stuff left behind by ancestors. Unless it’s a reference to the cost, and what it will do to any inheritance you were hoping to leave to your kids, given the only option seems to be an eight-course tasting menu at £120 a head. The head chef is Ahmed Abdalla who has spent time at Skosh in York as well as equally sprauncy hotels Lucknam Park and Whatley Manor (thegrandyork.co.uk).

The making of the new Elizabeth line has hampered Denmark Street, AKA Tin Pan Alley, and its environs for a very long time. Such a long time, in fact, that many of the 400,000 people a day who are expected to pass by the all-new, space-age Outernet building will have no memory of this neighbourhood’s former reassuringly shabby loveliness. Outernet is a £1bn music venue, office space, luxury hotel and lifestyle mothership that has gobbled up an entire block between New Oxford Street and Charing Cross Road, and its entrance is marked by badly dressed door persons in ill-fitting, steampunk-style frock coats. I could devote this whole column to the plethora of jaw-dropping, state-of-the art solutions Outernet will be providing for central London – it has the world’s largest high-resolution wraparound screens, everyone! – but I came here for the food and, by golly, Tattu has got it, albeit in very small portions of wagyu fillet carpaccio at £34.90 a throw. Or, say, four pretty chicken truffle shumai dim sum at £12.90, or wok-fired “angry bird” chicken (sweet-and-sour chicken with a few floating chillies to you and me) at £24.90 and only just enough to feed one. Tattu, much like Outernet itself, is big and bolshie in every sense. It is less of a restaurant and more of an Instagram content fulfilment hub with added £9 broccoli and £36.50 char siu monkfish. It is impossible to take a bad photo in here. The lighting is beautiful and several plates have pure novelty aspect, billowing smoke, cloches and/or googly eyes. This is a lavish, fake blossom-strewn, luxury amusement park ride imagining of, according to the PR spiel, a traditional Chinese courtyard house. Tattu is the perfect place to be photographed under a blossom chandelier while sipping a smoking skull cocktail or poking a plate of colourful, £14.50 royal koi fish gau dim sum. Readers, I actually did this myself, posing, then posting a story of me watching a server unveil a chocolate “dragon egg” from under a smoking cloche, because living the ’gram life is pernicious. Ask yourself, if a woman eats shiitake bao (£11.50) on a rooftop in a fake Chinese courtyard, but there is nothing on Instagram to prove it, did it really happen? It’s lovely to see, once, but there are a hundred small Chinese places less than a mile down the road in, ahem, Chinatown that serve far more delicious food for a fraction of the price. Tattu is divided into four separate residences, themed around phoenix, koi, dragon and tiger, which means the dining room is confusing to navigate around, although, on the day I ate there, it was staffed plentifully with the sort of people who let you wander about for ages looking for your table, the bathroom or the lifts without quite realising it’s their job to steer you. Oh, how I miss the days when places were staffed by folk who had worked in a restaurant before, but, alas, here we are. The menu is brief and sort-of Chinese by way of Great Britain with South American and pan-European flourishes; it’s also littered with words and phrases such as “XO scallops”, “salmon caviar” and “wagyu” that make you feel you’re somewhere the Kardashians would enjoy. There’s a handful of dim sum options, 10 “raw” or “hot” small plates and 10 “large” plates. Spoiler: they are not large and prices hover around the £30-40 mark for lemon salt and black pepper lamb cutlets or Chilean sea bass with shaoxing wine and smoked bacon, before rocketing off into la-la land with £80 for green pepper lobster with jalapeños and crisp shallots. The cost is vastly offputting. I could almost tolerate giving Tattu £12 for dim sum, and that shiitake bao turned out to be nicely wobbly and moist, but had largely unmemorable innards. Delicate chicken truffle shumai were prettily puckered like little cats’ bums topped with a scattering of truffle. The best thing we ate was seven-spiced seared tuna from the raw small-plates section, featuring fine-quality tuna with some smoke from the grill, truffle and citrus ponzu and enough caviar to cover a Barbie doll’s forehead. At the main courses, my eyes danced around the page, rebelling about handing Tattu just north of £36 for a piece of honey-glazed monkfish. It arrived, just as I’d dreaded, overcooked to the point of dry, in a sweet caramel orange puddle. The “angry bird” chicken was a bowl of vivid red, sugary sauce concealing cashews, red pepper and a few bits of chicken garnished with past-its-best coriander. Entry level steamed jasmine rice is £6.50 on top, while candy rice with beetroot and ginger is a laughable £9. Pudding of “wood-smoked dragon egg” came under a cloche of steam, to reveal something that Thorntons would sell off after Easter for 88p and that tasted of almost nothing. Tattu as a restaurant and a bill will live on in my mind for ever. The memory is indelible. Tattu The Now Building Rooftop, Outernet, Denmark Place, London WC2, 020-3778 1985. Open all week, noon-10.30pm. From about £65 a head à la carte; tasting menus £80 or £120, all plus drinks and service.

Starters £8.95-£12.50, mains £16-£30, desserts £8, wine from £25 a bottle All restaurants attract tribes, and here at Les 2 Garçons a very particular tribe has come out to play. We can reach for obtuse euphemisms if we like, mangle the language in search of originality, but “the chattering middle classes” pretty much covers it. Perhaps they have a subscription to the LRB that they worry they don’t read enough of, or a membership to the Royal Academy that they fear they don’t use as regularly as they should. They adore BBC Radio 4, apart from the 6.30pm comedy shows, which they never laugh at. They love good coffee and well-made sourdough. They despair of the government, hope Keir Starmer is the real thing and fantasise about going on holiday to France. Frankly, they’d go there more regularly if such behaviour didn’t make them fear that, with age, had come entrenched habits. They might well be down to only one of their own hips. They are this newspaper’s readers. Oh, sod it. They are me. This tiny French bistro, tucked in at the bottom of north London’s Crouch Hill, has just 22 seats. There are bare floorboards, net curtains halfway up the windows and a lot of blackboards for the scribbling up of beguiling specials. It could have been designed with both them and me in mind. It is a perfect expression of our love for a certain kind of classic, unfussy but luscious French cookery, lubricated by good butter, powered by chopped garlic and fistfuls of fresh green herbs. Every menu description conjures up an image of how happy you will be eating it. Not a single one lets you down. The dishes here could have been served at any time over the previous nine decades. They just might not always have been quite so good. It’s what you would expect of these two particular garçons. Chef Robert Reid has classical French chops forged in the greatest of French kitchens: he cooked at Roger Verge’s Moulins de Mougins on the Riviera, at au Crocodile in Strasbourg and Joel Robuchon’s Jamin in Paris, before returning to London. There, he became head chef at Marco Pierre White’s Oak Room when it held three Michelin stars. At the Oak Room he met Jean-Christophe Slowik, a front-of-house veteran who had worked at Le Manoir and at Harvey’s, Pierre-White’s original launch pad, before opening his own neighbourhood restaurant, L’Absinthe, in Primrose Hill. These careers are akin to those of veteran guitarists and bassists who, between them, have played with Yes and Soft Machine, Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, King Crimson and Genesis: less monsters of rock than monsters of stock. This evening the room is full, even though it is only a little after six. The diners seem delighted to be the first sitting, certain in the knowledge they can do the full restaurant thing and still be back home by 8.30pm, digesting dinner while slumped in front of BBC4. Slowik, customary scarf tied at his neck, works the tables with almost comic Gallic charm, depositing glasses of kir with just a blush of cassis, and talking up the blackboard specials. Reid is also out here, playing rush goalie, blue and white striped apron over his whites, Marco style. He takes orders and delivers dishes from the kitchen at the back, where there are a couple of other cooks. It is a tight operation, as it needs to be with so few tables. It turns out that other newspapers also have restaurant critics. Who knew? One of them had just stumbled upon the place. I ask Slowik if that’s why it’s so full so early. No, he says. It’s been like this since they opened in the autumn last year. It just fills up a little quicker now. So what did we eat? Oh, you know. All the good stuff. Snails are served out of the shell, in a fearsomely hot dimpled cast-iron tray, with garlic butter made with fields of fresh herbs, more torn than chopped. We are given a brown paper bag of sliced warm baguette that quickly becomes a vehicle for all the herby butter. From the specials board comes asparagus in its prime, with a salad of freshly podded peas in a dressing of lemon and truffle. Do I need tell you there are also duck rillettes and steak tartare and an onion soup gratinated with maximum intent? Nah, you would have worked that out. A properly crisped leg of duck confit slumps into a bed of white beans and lardons, with a little salad to help you soak up all the lovingly saturated animal fats and make you feel that your diet is balanced. A chicken breast of impeccable pedigree is presented in a limpid broth of vegetables with, to help it all along, a ramekin of sauce gribiche, that brilliant eggy sauce with mustard and cornichons and so on, which improves most things. We could have had steak frites with béarnaise sauce or roast seabass with new potatoes, or shared a roast leg of Pyrenean lamb with a gratin dauphinoise and wild mushrooms. We could have done all of that, but we didn’t. After the disappointment of the clumsily made rum baba at the LaLee a few weeks back, it is a joy to have the real thing, made by a man who has been making them for his entire working life. The tall muffin of a savarin has exactly the right, light texture. It has been soaked enthusiastically in syrup and split vertically down the middle so it lies now on its back, surrendered. Rum has been added and then ignited so that the dish sits before me with guttering blue flames. The scoop of crème Chantilly melts gently in the heat. A milk chocolate mousse, dotted sweetly with a ring of buttons, is a reminder that a chocolate pot does not always have to be a dark, dense thing that sucks the very light from the universe. The wine list is a parade of bottles from Burgundy and Alsace, the Languedoc and the Rhone. It is an entirely unsurprising collection. Which is the point of a restaurant like this; indeed, of the entire tradition of which it is a part. A true bistro is not there to surprise or dazzle. It is not meant to place you outside your comfort zone. It is designed specifically to be your comfort zone. Les 2 Garçons is about as complete and delightful an expression of that as I have come across in a very long time. News bites Jon Parry, who made his name at the Mash Inn at Radnage, Buckinghamshire, with his brand of home-grown produce cooked over fire, has moved on. He has joined the White Hart at Wytham, just outside Oxford. His opening menu, while he finds his feet, includes roast mackerel with fresh horseradish, turbot with a herb butter sauce, rhubarb Bakewell tart and pouring cream, and a lemon posset with a suet sable (whitehartwytham.com). Dinner by Heston Blumenthal at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in London’s Knightsbridge, has introduced a highly illustrated card system to enable diners to manage how much interruption they get from the waiters. Customers are invited to place the card of their choice in a holder. They range from the Adventurer – “I’d like the food to do the talking” – through the Guide, to the Maverick. The latter invites you to enjoy ‘a trip down the rabbit hole of Heston’s imagination’. The language may be somewhat grandiose, but the principle behind the idea could be welcome in many restaurants (dinnerbyheston.co.uk). South African born Hylton Espey, formerly the head chef of Rastella in Falmouth, Cornwall, is to open his first independent restaurant in the town next month. Culture will spotlight Cornish produce and will feature an ever-changing multi-course “Journey Menu”. Dishes will include local lamb with hedgerow herbs and sea vegetables, and Cornish crab with a burnt onion and fermented garlic aioli (culturerestaurant.co.uk).

She loves modern Middle Eastern food, and was well into the idea of fancy hummus, braised hispi cabbage and charred oyster mushrooms on skewers. It was only after the third time she attempted to add “perhaps a chicken dish” to our order that the penny finally dropped. “There is no chicken,” I revealed. Sometimes, when springing vegetarian food on friends, my tactic is subterfuge: softly, softly I shall lure you into my world of silken tofu and seitan-worship. Lunch doesn’t always need to have once had a face to be fabulous. Thankfully, at Bubala, you can pacify a carnivore with the corn ribs, sticky with black garlic pilpelchuma, and warm challah to drag greedily through bowls of baba ganoush made glossy with curry leaf oil and pine nuts. Bubala Soho is this outfit’s second incarnation, after Helen Graham and Marc Summers made a successful start in Spitalfields some three years ago, when I heard only good things about this all-day, plant-based, rather elegant spot that’s clearly influenced by the likes of Ottolenghi and Moro. I did wonder whether the pandemic might finish such places off, leaving only the financially cushioned big beasts thriving. Hell, no: Bubala has taken its sumptuous chunks of halloumi smothered in camomile and honey and its confit potato latkes to Soho. It’s just a totter along from the delightful new Firebird that I recently wrote about favourably, and it’s not far from Dai Chi, the kushiage place that fed me in April. Soho is an unfathomable entity right now: rents and business rates are extortionate, commuters show their face only three days a week, if that, and retail openings seem to be made up entirely of American Candy Stores, yet in W1 restaurants are still opening at lightning pace. On a Friday lunchtime, the new Bubala is thriving with both groups of friends and business meetings. Service is that type of warm that makes you want to stay and hang out with the gang afterwards, because they seem to be having such a good laugh, and besides, they’ve got air-con, which, on a day that reached 40C in London, was joyful. On scanning menu of dishes such as “maitake mushroom &amp; baharat butter, barberry jam” and “grapefruit ezme, tahini, pomegranate molasses”, it’s clearly rather common to feel a bit bamboozled by choice. This is where the restaurant’s “Bubala Knows Best” feasting menu is an absolute boon. I railed against going down this route two or three times, asking the server for just five more minutes to make up my mind, until finally I caved in, said “Feed me”, and the floodgates opened. There were bowls of smooth and luxurious hummus finished with burnt butter and served with laffa flatbread for dipping, and of pale, creamy labneh dotted with aromatic garlic and a liberal amount of za’atar. Dishes as glossy and luxuriantly finished as Chris Pine’s new hair; there are no dry bites here. Humble cornish mids potatoes, for example, come with silken tofu and smoked harrisa salsa, and we stirred them into vesuvio tomatoes, mango, tamarind and cumin. Yes, you could make these things at home, but it would take all day and 17 different bowls, and you’d be sponging hummus off the ceiling for days after an accident with the Magimix. Bubala, you see, really does know best. They knew I needed the roast cauliflower with bkeila, tomato and slightly sweet yoghurt, and the braised hispi with seaweed that has a citrus burst of dried orange and an undertone of sesame. The latkes are like the delightful, deep-fried concertina’d spuds you get at the Quality Chop House and on the fanciest Sunday roasts, though here they’re served with a puddle of toum, AKA Lebanese garlic sauce. There were also grilled skewers of soft leek with amba, as well as an unusual Chinese cabbage with preserved lime and cardamom. A bottle of blanc de blancs will set you back £40, but a glass of the house white, Agredo Bianco, is £6, while non-drinkers will love the “gazoz”, or homemade sodas; I found the blueberry, jasmine, rosemary and thyme number to be entirely complementary to eating far too much challah. Desserts, if you get that far, are simple, wholesome and homespun: there was date and tahini ice-cream, and coconut fudge, and we lingered over a rice flour-based coconut malabi pudding with hibiscus and sesame brittle before accepting that they possibly needed our table back. As we left, my guest thanked me for choosing Bubala, and didn’t even quibble over the lack of chicken, prime rib or langoustine. When luring friends over to the dark side of titivated cabbage, things don’t get any better than that.

Another waiter is in a rainbow sequined dress, and a third has a black sequined dress with a dashing opera cape. Rightly, they pair these outfits with sensible-looking trainers. The brilliant thing about all of this dress up is that it suits the decor. It’s the best kind of nuts. The floors and many of the walls are painted mandarin orange, apart from those bits decorated with expanded images from Willow pattern, among many other things. The ceiling is strung with fairy lights and wide bolts of red, diaphanous cloth. In one corner there’s a huge, soft panda and in another a small deer. The stuffed toy animal looks thoroughly startled. I can quite see why. For no obvious reason, silver bunting reading “Happy 50th Birthday” is strung across our side of the dining room. Oh well. It’s bound to be somebody’s 50th some time. The table cloths, under thick, transparent protectors which your bare arms might later stick to, are decorated with Chinese stories and legends and the wine is served less in glasses than goblets, with multicoloured swirling and filigreed metal stems. Outside, overlooking the marina, are bright-red tables under a broad spreading tree hung with numerous lanterns. The laminated menu is an equally garish riot of images and typefaces. All of this pageant and jollity would be merely annoying if the food served at Gigi Gao’s Favourite Authentic Chinese wasn’t up to much, but it is very much up to everything. Aside from two deep-fried seafood dishes right at the start, which had been allowed to wallow in the deep fat fryer for too long, the largely Sichuan-accented food here is a grand old wallop of flavour and intent and just all round bloody good things. Gigi arrived in Swansea almost 20 years ago to study law at the university and was apparently struck by the dearth of good Chinese restaurants. Hence, in 2014, she opened this one at a location further into town, before moving it here in 2019 and letting her idiosyncratic eye for design run riot. By necessity, the long menu has a few standard Anglo-Chinese crowd pleasers, especially among the starters. Yes, you can have crispy duck and spring rolls, prawn toast and dumplings. There is a list of black bean dishes and another of sweet and sour. Don’t. Order instead a plate of the invigoratingly sharp black fungus salad or another of the smashed cucumber with julienned carrot. The menu is rich in these non-meat options, the most thrilling of which is a dish of griddled potatoes. They arrive in a small wok suspended within an ornate brass frame, with a guttering candle underneath. The discs of potato manage to be both crunchy and soft at the same time and appear to have been blanched, then deep fried, then turned in a mess of spice and chilli and black beans, to create a joyously massive hit of crusty flavour. They are so good, so compelling, we order a second portion. To be fair there were eight of us at the table. To be even fairer, it cost only £8.98, which I regard as a weird, vaguely arbitrary price, the weirdness of which is entirely appropriate to the location. I scan the menu. The price of almost everything ends in 98, presumably because it is 1p less than 99 and 2p less than the full rounded-up £1. Oh yes, I can do all the maths. The key thing, of course, is the number before the 98s. Mostly it’s 6s, 7s and 8s with a handful of seafood dishes reaching the lofty altitudes of 12 and 13. Or to put it another way, we rampaged through the menu like toddlers let loose on a no-limits sweetie pick’n’mix, did not skimp on the booze and still came in at under £40 a head. You could eat here for a lot less and have a fabulous time. The vegetarian options include a rarely seen dish of shredded potato, served with a little bite. I’m used to it being cold. This is served warm, though it works well with the thumping flavours of the griddled potatoes. We have long-stewed aubergines in the deepest and darkest of sauces, and bright, a verdant meadow of garlic spinach to freshen everything up. There is a list of “lazy” dishes, because customers kept mishearing and misreading the Chinese word lazi, for chilli. The lazy bean curd, made with tofu skin boasting a proud, determined meatiness, comes in another fiery sauce with peanuts and dried chillies to be pulled to the side. There is something called barrel beef which, as the name suggests, is a barrel-shaped receptacle, lined with foil and filled with the kind of broth you could lose yourself in on a cold night or even a warm one, thick with ribbons of just-cooked beef and fresh green herbs, fresh and dried chillies. We order the chicken wings in Coke and conclude from the eye-widening, tooth-juddering sweetness of the thickened sauce that it was indeed made with a lot of Coke. Spare ribs in the kind of glossy five-spice sauce with which you could varnish a boat deck are an old Cantonese throwback to another sort of Anglo-Chinese restaurant, the ones I went to as a kid and loved. It’s like going to a party full of interesting people you don’t know, and in the middle coming across a dear old friend. We had among our number the great Jeremy Pang, panellist on the world-beating BBC Radio 4 show The Kitchen Cabinet and host of his own terrific ITV show on Asian cookery. He was able to guide us through the menu, but you really don’t need a Pang at your side. Just order anything that’s even slightly unfamiliar. It’s fair to say that Gigi took a shine to Jeremy, but in truth I think it’s just that we were a big table of enthusiastic eaters ready for everything she had to offer. And she offered the lot. To embellish the old line about Sinatra, it was Gigi Gao’s candy-coloured, garlanded, ribboned, sequined and tasselled world; we were just living in it. Is it really authentic? I don’t care. What matters is that it’s good. News bites Yorkshire-based Truefoods, which makes restaurant-quality stocks and sauces – I swear by their veal jus and so do many top-flight kitchens – has finally opened an online shop.

Small plates £4-£9, larger plates £11-£15, desserts £7, wines from £32 We live in desperate times. The Nusr-Et Steakhouse in Knightsbridge, famed for its hyper-expensive gold leaf-wrapped steaks has, according to the hospitality industry website Code, had to abandon using gold leaf. Just as with chickpeas and vegetable oil, there are supply-chain issues. So now they’re just flogging stupidly expensive steaks without any precious metals at all. Where’s the joy in that? They don’t even have that Salt Bae bloke, the one with the shades and the signature salting move, like Rod Hull’s Emu, “bare naked and disgracing himself by vomiting down his own neck” (yes, I’m quoting myself; I can’t improve upon that). He’s at one of his 15 other restaurants, where they are still pointlessly, performatively wrapping steaks in gold leaf so rich people can hate themselves just a little bit more. But hang on. It’s not all gloom. A new Mayfair joint has opened with the proud announcement that its menu will include a dish costing £3,000. Apparently, it involves a bucket load of caviar with a brooding sense of inadequacy on the side. I’m not naming the place, or the chef or the PR company responsible for promoting it, because that’s exactly what they want. All three should be utterly ashamed of themselves. And if they’re not, no worries because I’m ashamed of them. Stories like this can make you despair of the restaurant sector. What’s it for exactly? So let’s have something to restore a little faith which doesn’t involve gold leaf or caviar or a bloated lack of regard for anything costing less than a grand. Fat Macy’s is a social enterprise which tackles problems of homelessness by offering work placements and traineeships in the hospitality industry to people who need help getting out of temporary accommodation. I’ve mentioned them in my “news bites” section online a couple of times. They have an outside catering business, enabling their clients to work both alongside chefs in the kitchen and out front with customers. It’s a programme that helps them access the grants they need to pay rent deposits on a permanent home. Now they have their own rather lovely restaurant and wine bar. It’s in London’s Shoreditch and is called Sohaila, after the grandmother of the charity’s chief executive, Nathalie Moukarzel. “We use her recipes for a lot of our dishes,” she told me, simply. It has a short Middle Eastern menu, because this is Shoreditch and they know exactly what people like around here and generally it involves sumac and tahini. The kitchen is headed by Doug Rolle, who used to work at Brawn, which is a bit weird because that’s the third time in just over a month that I’ve had cause to mention Brawn. Perhaps it’s a conspiracy. Sohaila is a compact space. At lower ground there’s a high communal table, occupied the night I was there by a hooting, stomping party of properly lubricated happy souls. Up above, there’s a wine store at the front which will eventually house 100 labels, available both to drink here or take home. Then there’s the low-ceilinged dining room with bare floorboards, whitewashed brick walls and a casual “do what you like” vibe. It’s not the quietest of spaces. Sound echoes and clangs. But if you’ve come to Shoreditch looking for a cloister, you’ve made a serious wrong turn, probably at Holborn. What matters is the sprightliness of the food and the cheeriness with which it is delivered. None of the dishes will startle you, but they are all very good examples of their type. There’s an almost frothy lightness to the whipped taramasalata, sprinkled with some of that citrussy sumac, the dusting of purple a vivid contrast to the pink. It comes with crunchy radishes and leaves of crisp caraway seed cracker. There’s a big, heaped salad of Vesuvius tomatoes with golden fried shards of flat bread, much like a fattoush. Lightly roasted artichokes and friggitelli peppers come on a thick puddle of seasoned tahini. Naturally, there is a big round bowl of coarse smoky hummus, its central well filled with pungent, fresh green olive oil and more chickpeas. This is before the chickpea shortage has been announced and we eat it with the casualness of those who think there will always be hummus. From the larger dishes there is a tagine of the most tender rabbit, practically floating on the waft of cinnamon with, alongside it, a herby bulgur wheat pilaf. Only mushroom shish barak, filled pouches of slightly heavy pasta with spiced yoghurt, feels out of place; it’s a wintery dish amid the sunshine. Pricing for all this is exceptionally inviting, with no large dish costing more than £15 and the smaller plates coming in at around £7. Which is helpful, given the wine. Both the list and the growing bottle shop is referred to as a “library”. That’s a troubling use of language. I can promise you that if I withdraw one of those bottles it’s not coming back, or if it does it won’t contain the same liquid it went out with. And because it’s Shoreditch in 2022, it’s all natural and quirky. That’s fine, because I’ve now learned how to say, “Give me something that doesn’t have back notes of sewer,” without sounding aggressive. The wine is overseen by Alexandros Vainas, who used to be at Morito. He’s an engaging and enthusiastic guide. He takes my resistance in his stride and finds us a slightly effervescent rosé from Spain. The problem is that this commitment to quirky wineries comes at a cost. There’s nothing on the list below £32. Most of it is £40 or well above. It unbalances the price of the experience. They need to add a few bottles accessible to those on tighter budgets. Because, in a restaurant sector that really can be full of badly polished turds, somewhere like Sohaila deserves to flourish. It’s charming, the food is great and at its heart is a noble purpose. I have no idea whether I was served by any of the Fat Macy’s trainees. It would be rather missing the point to highlight their journey to the side of my table. All I know is that, at the end, we were fed a ludicrously rich chocolate mousse topped by an outrageous tahini caramel with walnuts for crunch, and a lemon posset, beneath a lake of gorgeous raspberry coulis. We drank our rosé and gave thanks that amid all the clumsy, pathetic PR stunts, there can still be restaurants like Sohaila. News bites The restaurant industry charity Hospitality Action has announced a major fundraiser in Liverpool this autumn. The four-course dinner, on 7 November at the Hilton Liverpool, will be cooked by four big name chefs from the northwest: Ellis Barrie of Lerpwl, Aiden Byrne of the Church Green, Paul Leonard of the Forest Side and Tom Parker of the White Swan. Tickets, which include drinks and canapés and wine with the meal, are £130 each. Book here. It seems a little rotten to pass on bad news about Birmingham when it is the focus of such a celebration of sport, but sometimes I am merely the reporter. A study of data from the Food Standards Agency has found the city had the highest proportion of restaurants with poor scores under the hygiene rating scheme, with 11% of restaurants and takeaways having just one or two stars. Second worst was Southend-on-Sea with 7% followed by Westminster. Ipswich is the most hygienic, with 100% of establishments scoring four or five stars. The southwest-based seafood restaurant group Rockfish has announced plans to add three more outposts to the eight-strong collection. Alongside the previously announced Rockfish in Salcombe, there will be sites in Sidmouth and Topsham. They have also acquired two of their suppliers to help streamline the supply chain, and have dropped cod from their menus in favour of native species. Visit therockfish.co.uk.

Perhaps it’s their sense of gentle righteousness that puts me on the back foot. We all, roughly speaking, would love planet Earth not to die, choking in an oily fire slick littered with drowned polar bears, but how many of us actually do anything truly useful about it? Then along comes a place like Chantelle Nicholson’s Apricity, staffed by mellow, thoughtful, industrious types who genuinely care about how the restaurant scene affects our planet. Suddenly, terms such as hyperseasonal, foraged, zero waste and low intervention enter the ether, which are all lovely concepts, obviously, and then I’m nine courses in and having the arse end of a reclaimed turnip-top fricassee explained to me, blinking in submission as the server explains how the chef rose at dawn to drain sap from trees. And, yes, the fricassee does taste a bit fizzy, doesn’t it? It’s at this point that I think guiltily about the punnet of Moroccan blueberries I ate that morning before hurling the plastic carton in the recycling, like some sort of planet-hating sociopath. With Apricity, however, the evening turns out to be nothing like that at all. This is an airy, elegant, happy room in Mayfair with a menu that will send vegetarians doolally with joy, but also has meat and fish dishes that are certainly no afterthought. The vegetarian stars of the show, to my mind, are the soft, jammy Isle of Wight aubergine made even more glorious with a vivid green zhoug and roasted almond butter, and the miso-roasted cabbage with smoked hemp cream and molasses that’s awash with an umami sauce that you’ll want to cast a finger over to scrape up every last drop. What’s more, they’re delivered without sermon or soliloquy, because Apricity just kind of gets on with it. They’re just good people in beautiful uniforms running a very fancy Mayfair restaurant and serving delicious things that make minimal impact on all our futures. If you go, do order the London red butterhead salad, which, let’s be frank, sounds like nothing to write home about, but is, in fact, a fairytale arrangement of pond-green leaves, lettuce and crispy kale, all assembled into a flower and dotted with miso aïoli and fragments of cashew. The dish feels oddly otherworldly, as if it might flutter and speak of its own accord. For the record, I took a meat-lover with me, the long-suffering Charles, who is still mentally scarred by the time I took him to Beetroot Sauvage in Edinburgh and made him eat chilli sin carne not six feet from a woman in yoga pants with a camel toe. How he suffers for my art. Yet we have spoken several times about Apricity since our visit, about the good sourdough with Hollis Mead salted butter and the excellent grilled sea trout with a side of pink fir potatoes in brown butter, and have agreed to go back for the tasting menu some time. In fact, though there is meat on the menu in the form of Devon pork belly with kimchi and cull yaw ewe (mutton to you and me) with spicy chickpeas, we didn’t order them, because the other dishes just felt instinctively better. Perhaps in the near future we will find a good, working name for this new burgeoning genre of vegetarian-with-meat restaurants, but nothing quite sums it up yet – the word “flexitarian” makes me cringe, while “demi-vegetarian” doesn’t quite cut it. Semantics aside, Apricity is a restaurant dedicated to making vegetables the star of the show, which is a skill we’ve never quite nailed in this country. Yes, there are oysters, but you glory in the black pearl mushrooms alongside them, spiced with XO sauce, Flanders wheat and wild garlic. There’s a baby kale salad with hemp tahini and crispy onion that is a purely pleasurable way to get one of your five a day. I drank kombucha, which is my idea of a party these days (they make it themselves, of course), but they’ll also get you gloriously tipsy on sloe vodka spritz or a Rémy’s beet made with cognac, beetroot and raspberry liqueur. We ate early on a Saturday evening, and left even before the chihuahua at the next table looked like calling it a night, though not before inhaling a chouxnut – the clue is in the title, being part-choux, part-doughnut – with stewed apple and double cream, plus, because two puddings are my talent, the Esmeralda milk chocolate baked mousse with miso and brown sugar custard, which was really too dainty to share, so I didn’t. Eat dinner, save the planet and be a superhero while eating vast amounts of brown butter smothered on spuds. Apricity, you are too good and truly delicious.

The pair left the excellent, if somewhat outback gastropub The Compasses Inn in Crundale, Kent, at the end of last summer, promising they had bigger plans afoot. And here they are at Tallow: 26 covers and a 10-seat private dining room in Southborough, a leafy town in the civil parish of Tunbridge Wells, yet, I hasten to add, a whole 2.6 miles from the town’s main railway station. Do not, I beg you, say that Southborough is actually just Tunbridge Wells, or its residents will revolt. Well, they will after they’ve finished playing cricket on the common overlooked by the heroically pretty St Peter’s Church. Parking up on a Saturday lunchtime with the cricket in full swing is a bit like guest-starring in a Miss Marple mystery, perhaps even more so when you get to Tallow itself, a tall, narrow building painted a rather gothic dark grey. Just as it was at the Compasses, Tallow’s food is unquestionably good. More than that, it’s get-in-the-car-and-go good. It’s “How far is Southborough, anyway?” good. Rob Taylor’s cooking seems, on first glance at the menu, reassuringly straightforward – there’s a steak tartare starter and chocolate brownie on the pudding list – yet his work is much more surprising. Take one of the first offerings, a small, freshly baked wild garlic bread that was sticky, fragrant and vividly Kermit-coloured. There was no need for butter, because its innards were moist with some sort of buttery, salty, algae-like concoction. Such touches always show a restaurant that’s going the extra yard. In a similar vein, a pre-lunch snack of crisp lamb croquette with a neat, mint mayo topping was substantial yet delicate at the same time. Tallow’s kitchen is on the first floor, which must mean a heavy calf muscle workout for the serving staff every shift, up and down those stairs, but they do it with endless esprit. Donna and her staff have a bright style that leaves you unequivocal about the fact that they really care about that plate of barbecued loin of pork with confit belly and celeriac and horseradish puree, or that they have personally eaten everything on the menu and would quite happily eat it all again right now, if time and work commitments allowed. I can’t blame them, because there is always time for carbohydrates in the form of Tallow’s warm terrine of potato and Cashel blue: translucent layers of clearly deeply cherished spud mixed with pleasantly pungent blue-veined cheese from Tipperary. (Incidentally, we had Cashel blue delivered by the kilo during lockdown, until my heart valves begged Charles to stop, but I was still overjoyed to see it on a menu again.) Again, at face value, “potato and cheese terrine” doesn’t sound much to write home about, but this one is so much more than the sum of its parts. It was topped with a hedge of microherb salad so high that Donna quipped she’d been late for work because Rob had given her the chore of clipping it all from their home patch. Tallow’s steak tartare is likewise ludicrously pretty, dotted with rich confit egg yolk and the briefest suggestion of pickled shallot. My favourite course may well have been the hake starter, featuring plump, perfectly timed fried white fish in a heavenly puddle of elegant curry sauce, with three of the fattest, meatiest, shelled mussels drinking in the fragrant broth. This is my sort of fine dining: the highest-quality ingredients and intricate plating, but with the coy undertones of walking back tipsily from the chip shop. For main, we shared a roast thornback ray wing with a delightful green mess of broad beans and sea vegetables, and some smoked haddock bonbons. One day, I’ll write a thesis on the culinary differences between the croquette, the bonbon and the kushikatsu panko-crumbed skewer, but now is not the time. A tart of caramelised garlic and parsley with baby leeks and onion puree was beautifully constructed, but such a funky collaboration of flavours that it’s definitely not one for the allium-phobic. I sought refuge in a side of fresh Kentish asparagus – a huge whopping bundle of the stuff – that negated its one-of-your-five-a-day prowess with a thick dijon mayo and a scattering of crisp onions. As at The Compasses, the desserts at Tallow linger. Yes, there was a very good, light homemade shortbread with whipped vanilla cream cheese and fresh, sweet gariguette strawberries, but the rather dull-sounding “chocolate and hazelnut brownie” was nothing of the sort: instead, this was a plinth of rich chocolate-and-hazelnut mousse in a glistening pool of salted caramel and miso sauce – so much sauce, and so glossy, in fact, I could have styled my hair in the reflection. The whole assembly was topped with a perfect quenelle of coffee ice-cream, and followed by a wobble back to the car. Spring Saturday lunches don’t get much better than this.

Your average diner liked vegetables, sure, but preferred them with a lovely steak. Or even a not particularly lovely steak, such as the ones served at the Covent Garden Angus Steakhouse, where tourists flocked for the 12oz ribeye and the Carolina chunky chips smothered in cheese and crisp bacon. Or at least they did until it was closed and replaced by a new and very busy branch of Mildreds. Interestingly, the Burger King on nearby Leicester Square also turned vegan for a month this year, serving plant-based Whoppers to constant queues. Plants, it seems, are coming for us all, although anyone who has seen The Day of the Triffids would be under no illusions about any of this. Modern-day Mildreds is no longer the odd kid on the block. Once, it was a name to have up your sleeve for when weird Auntie June who didn’t shave her armpits came to town. Now, it is sleek and elegant; the new St Martin’s Lane branch even has a 10-person private dining room called Jane’s Place. Today’s clientele are everyday – mixed groups, birthday parties, etc – just as they are at the Pizza Express next door. My abiding memory of my Friday lunch was how they’re in dire need of more staff to deal with all the hopeful walk-ins gawping at the menu outside and blocking the doorway. The menu is delightfully bizarre in presentation, in a tiny font and all lower case, and featuring strings of words such as “mercimek kofte, pea &amp; pomegranate freekeh, dill tahini” or “alma bowl, sweetcorn goji quinoa, rainbow ribbons, neep &amp; beet pickle, leche de tigre shrub, almond queso fresco, avocado cream, omega seeds”; “edamame, szechuan passion, furikake” sits alongside “tempeh laab club cultured, prik nam pla dressing, leaves, herbs”. Mildreds’ menu is a list of geographically incongruent small and main plates influenced by the cuisines of India, Turkey, Korea, Thailand, South America, Los Angeles and beyond, with authentic-sounding names spliced with fake meats and terms for alternative proteins. Thus a rather straightforward, fake-chicken kebab, for example, is listed as “bhatti ka chick’n” – it was great, incidentally: smoky and well seasoned, served with a mango pickle yoghurt and a bowl of rich, sweet tomato chilli chutney. The soy chick’n that Mildreds uses is one I’ve seen in several good restaurants recently, has a disconcertingly real mouth-feel and soaks up the tastes of griddle pans, spices and sauces incredibly well. Lord knows where we’ll be with all this stuff in 10 years’ time – the leaps and bounds in the fake meat world are utterly amazing. “Katsu hot dog” was slightly less exciting, because the breadcrumbed faux frankfurter wasn’t quite warm, but it was saved by a pile of zingy pickled daikon that made me overlook the bowl of anonymous katsu curry sauce. A plate of gunpowder bonda – pea, spinach and potato fritters – lacked much evidence of heat, although more successful were the spinach gyoza that turned up with yet more daikon and a sharp orange lime ponzu. We ordered a “faux rerro cake” with chocolate sauce, hazelnut praline and “chantilly cream”, although we knew the latter wasn’t feasible, and the arrival of this chocolate cake was the point when Charles, who typically grizzles through all vegetarian restaurant visits but had been jovial up until this point, began to grumble. “It tastes of mushrooms,” he said. “OK, yes,” I agreed. “It’s a bit earthy, but it looks the part.” Mildreds’ “vegan” menu is almost unique in its utter lack of any mention of being vegan, vegetarian, anti-meat, pro-planet or whatever. There’s no chummy mission statement next to the starters about being kind to pigs or saving us from cow farts, no whimsical poetry on the pudding list, no lecture at the bottom of the bill and no invite by the coat stand to a vegan poetry slam evening. This is the first meat-free establishment I’ve eaten in that didn’t try to flog me a holistic birth doula service when I sat on the loo. Mildreds is unapologetic and utterly un-preachy, and there’s nothing more than a small “100% plant-based” mention on the menu. They’ve been doing what they do since 1988, and it has now become fashionable. Mildreds is not here to change your mind; if you don’t like it, hop off. They’re a bit long in the tooth for explanations and, besides, they’re far too busy, anyway. Mildreds 79 St Martin’s Lane, London WC2, 020-8066 8393.

Starters £14-£35, pastas £17-£53, secondi £29-£75, desserts £11-£16, wines from £50 It was when they started pumping a soft, lilting chill-out cover of Joy Division’s Love Will Tear Us Apart into the dining room that I really began to lose the will to live. We’d already been subjected to spayed versions of Madonna classics. Now the DJ at Il Borro was subjecting us to an ugly, disfigured cover of the Manchester gloomster’s finest. I wasn’t sure which was worse: the dismal music or the seafood pasta with just one langoustine, one shrimp, three clams and three mussels for £46. Actually, I was sure. The music was very bad. The mean pasta was truly dismal. Il Borro opened last November in a cavernous two-floor marble and blonde-wood site by London’s Berkeley Square, and is a spin-off from the high-end Italian Il Borro winery near Arezzo, owned by the luxury fashion brand Salvatore Ferragamo. In Mayfair, that last sentence works as foreplay. The restaurant’s website says it wants to introduce us all to their “Tuscan Way of Life”. This Tuscan way of life involves enough beige furnishings to make a White Company buyer horny, terrible tartan suits for the head waiters, and a menu priced to part bored rich people from their money. So why go? Two reasons. Firstly, this man cannot live by small plates and “curated” lists of natural wines served in former warehouse buildings alone. Light and shade, people. Light and shade. And secondly, Il Borro has the words “Tuscan Bistro” above the door. That’s intriguing because London got one of those only two months before it opened. Russell Norman’s Brutto is an elbows-on-the-table sort of place in Clerkenwell, knocking out rugged plates of panzanella for £8.40 and penne for a tenner. The basic proposition is exactly the same; the pricing and approach, rather less so. Obviously, Il Borro has Mayfair rents and laundry costs to meet and a DJ with extremely dodgy taste to support. But even allowing for that I wanted to know: does more money buy you better food? No. It does not. It buys you access to a weird, roaring other reality, where tables of open-collared men sit staring at their phones, their faces bathed in a blue glow, or barking at each other about the latest top deals from HSBC Global. Vaguely terrified-looking waiters hover about with carafes of aggressively priced reds, their spouts so performatively long and thin you don’t know whether they’re going to top up the punters’ glasses or catheterise them. I might have been fantasising there. We get an exuberant speech about how all the ingredients are organic, in keeping with the winery’s profound commitment to sustainability, and how much of it is transported in from the wine estate itself. One dish mentions “Tuscan baby chicken”. I ask the waiter whether this means the chicken has literally come from Tuscany, an achievement given the current state of air travel. He checks with the kitchen. Yes, he says excitedly, it is a Tuscan chicken. Because obviously no mediocre British chicken will do. Although the chickens have made the trip, none of the winery’s whites have. They aren’t on the list. Other things are. The cheapest bottle here is £50. I find a delicious Villa Sparina Gavi at £80, which I could buy retail for £16.45. So that would only be a mark-up by a factor of four. Just shut up and drink your wine. Anyway, we’re here for dinner so let’s get on with it. Sometimes, when an experience slumps from mediocrity to “I want mummy”, I worry that a superb dish will come along, the praising of which will interfere with my ranting’s flow. I have to be fair. At Il Borro that never happens. It starts with a mean selection of badly made breads, including swabs of focaccia with the dense, moist texture of a sodden Tena pad. It’s weird. London is full of great focaccia. So is Tuscany for that matter. How can they think this thudding lump of draft excluder is OK? Starters take an age to follow, with the waiters giving unrequested updates. Unfortunately, they do eventually arrive. Calamaretti and gamberi fritti are limp, as if the glossy surroundings have given them performance anxiety. It suggests they’ve sat on the pass for a while, long enough for the topping of thinly sliced fried courgette to have taken on a pronounced fishiness. Then there’s that meagre seafood pasta for £46. When you find yourself counting the shells and only get to three something is up. The sauce is dull and sugary; the modest amount of al dente pasta is the only solid part of the dish. That exceedingly well-travelled chicken is described on the menu as spicy. What arrives is dull and torpid. It made the trip in vain. Most extraordinary is the peposo, a famed Tuscan stew of braised beef and peppercorns. At Brutto it is a luscious, comforting wintery stew, full of tangled meat and popping spice. It costs £15.80. At Il Borro the braised meat is in hefty mouth-drying chunks. It costs £41. Blimey, eating like a rustic Italian is expensive these days. The peposo comes with bronzed, hard-cornered bricks of fried polenta, like Jenga blocks, only nowhere near as much fun to play with. A humble Italian ingredient has been engineered to within an inch of its life to become less food than fashion item. Wear it as a brooch. As a consolation prize we order a £9 side of their triple-cooked chips with rosemary salt. They, too, arrive tepid and soft and, for what it’s worth, without a hint of rosemary. I don’t usually complain about poor dishes for fear of tipping them off that all is less than joyous. I worry they won’t co-operate when we ask to send in a photographer. These are so ludicrously bad I can’t help myself. I invite the waiter to try them. Why should I suffer alone? They are taken off the bill. From an uninspiring dessert list, featuring cheesecake and panna cotta, we share a £12 thudding tiramisu. The bill is an unsurprising £334. What’s really depressing is the lack of ambition in a city full of great Italian restaurants. What’s even more depressing is that it’s doing a roaring trade. It’s full of people eating dismal food without caring about the prices. But the most depressing thing, to me at least, is that nothing I say about any of this will make the slightest bit of difference. There was only one thing to do. I went home and listened to some Joy Division to cheer myself up. News bites One of the founders of London’s Toklas, reviewed very positively on this page a few weeks ago, is behind a new venture opening next month in Margate. The Fort Road Hotel, located inside one of the town’s older buildings, describes itself as an ‘art and food destination’ courtesy of the involvement of Frieze magazine founder Matthew Slotover of Toklas and artist Tom Gidley. There will be artworks from the likes of Margate-born Tracey Emin, and a menu of pork terrine with pickled cherries, clay baked sea trout, and wild blackberry pancakes. At fortroadhotel.com. Robbie Lorraine, last seen cooking a slightly bonkers but completely compelling menu at his restaurant Only Food and Courses in Brixton, is to be the head chef at Boys Hall, a new hotel also opening in Kent this September. His menu will include lobster doughnuts alongside braised belly of pork with bacon jam, black pudding and pork ‘quavers’. Visit boys-hall.com. Generally, crowdfunders are used to help open restaurants. It is perhaps a sign of the times that chef Damian Wawrzyniak has launched one to help him close his. Faced by rising costs on all fronts, Wawrzyniak has decided that the last service at his modern Polish restaurant House of Feasts in Peterborough will be on 21 August. In a novel venture which may not be positively received in all quarters, he is now looking to raise £50,000 to help him pay off staff and suppliers. He then intends to find a new location.

Snacks and starters £4-£9, mains £11-£22, desserts £4-£7.50, wines from £21 For years it was the Bristol restaurant I only ever passed on the way to somewhere else. I was always responding instead to the beguiling call of the city’s seemingly endless stream of new and diverting eating options; to the promise of handmade pastas, or ripe stews drawing on French country cooking traditions, as if summoning the ghost of Bristol’s most beloved culinary son, Keith Floyd. I liked the look of the place, hunkered down there on the edge of Bristol’s Floating Harbour, but nothing made me think I should bother to stop. Scanning the online reviews for what was once the Severnshed, those footprints in the digital snow that all departed restaurants leave, I can see it had an interesting history. Firstly, there’s the building itself, a boatshed designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel when he was working on the Clifton Suspension Bridge in the early 19th century. It became a well-regarded restaurant in the late 1990s, boasting a chef with time at the River Café on his CV. In 2000 it housed an exhibition by some cult local artist called Banksy. The restaurant changed hands, and seemed to go downhill, culminating in the moment in 2018 when a customer complained that they had been charged £13 for being served a £1.15 Asda camembert. They knew it was an Asda camembert because it was still in its wrapper. The chef was sacked. Eventually, just before the first lockdown, the previous company went into receivership. Now it has been reborn as Harbour House, with local chef Ross Gibbens overseeing the kitchen, and turning his gaze westwards towards Cornwall. A lot of his menu looks to be serviceable rather than diverting: a Caesar salad and a club sandwich, a burger, a risotto, steak and chips. But at its heart is a list of dishes celebrating “seafood from the southwest” and in particular the comely Cornish fishing village of St Mawes. That’s where the main action is. Before we get into that action let me say this: Harbour House is just a delightful place to be. On a warm summer’s day, the broad vaulting dining room, with its greenery and naked rafters, sparkles with sunlight bouncing off the harbour’s waters outside. We are shown through the doors on to the deck, once again full of that giddy, relaxed chatter you get from people who know they have lucked out. They are pleased to be here, at the water’s edge with the view of the multicoloured houses over the way. The young team seem genuinely pleased to have them here, too. With all that in place the food’s job is very simple: don’t be rubbish. It isn’t rubbish. To nibble on, we start with what they call their “posh” onion rings, because I’m a sucker for anything which flaunts itself as having go-faster stripes. I don’t know about posh but they are certainly grand and mighty. They are big, round, blousy affairs, battered to a shattering crunch, and come with a coarse tartare sauce worthy of the name. It’s quite the snack for a fiver. The rest of our choices come from that seafood menu. There is a grilled mackerel fillet, its quicksilver skin bubbled and blistered, on ribbons of pickled cucumber, with mint leaves and the tickle of a wasabi glaze. Three fat scallops from the day’s specials list arrive as a military column marching across the plate, on a mayo heavy with saffron alongside chunks of chorizo. A seafood linguine for £17.50, which would make the clumsy £46 offering from Il Borro last week grossly ashamed of itself, is a big old mess of brown and white crab meat, prawns and mussels in a seafood bisque so rich it could buy itself one of those yachts with a jetski on the back. A hulking piece of cod lies on a spiced stew of tomatoey white beans with a few more nuggets of chorizo, with the lightly bitter joys of cavolo nero. We have chips, really good ones, because we are by the water. That’s my excuse. Is it all perfectly executed? Well no, not exactly. There’s a slightly eager hand on the salt in the mackerel dish; the cod could have stopped cooking 15 seconds earlier. But when you look at the pricing and the proposition, the laid-back loveliness of this deck in the heart of Bristol, these minor things count only as observations rather than details to get cross about. The dessert list stops at all the stations of the sweet English cross. There’s a lemon tart and a sticky toffee pudding and an Eton mess. But there is also something called a profiterole tower, £10 for two. It is one of those goldfish bowl-sized glasses that hen nights drink out of before the good ideas turn bad, filled with perfectly made golf ball-sized profiteroles, Chantilly cream and a couple of strawberries. Over that is poured a small pan of warm chocolate sauce. If you need me to describe the childlike joy of this, then you have suffered a massive failure of imagination. While acknowledging I should have stopped here when it was the Severnshed back in the day, I can at last confess my delight at having stopped here now that it’s Harbour House. I was in Bristol to interview my stunt double, the always joyous Rev Richard Coles, who recently picked up the professional knife and fork while I was down with the lurgy. He has just published his first novel, the hugely entertaining Murder Before Evensong, and after interrogating him before an audience of Bristol faithful we sloped off to Cotto Wine Bar &amp; Kitchen. It’s the new place on St Stephen’s Street from the skilled team behind Pasta Ripiena and Bianchi’s, among others. It’s everything that I love about the city’s small restaurants: a clever interior that looks like it was knocked up using plywood, an Allen key and a few tins of eggshell; a short Italian-inflected menu full of good things at damn decent prices, and a come-hither vibe. We have rounds of braised then crisped lamb belly with salsa verde and thumpingly bitter radicchio, and a steak tagliatta with a rocket and parmesan salad. We share a polenta cake topped with a thick layer of chocolate ganache and then stumble away up the hill to our hotel, powered by a funky wine, but don’t ask me its name because it was late and I wasn’t officially reviewing. The point is this: all was right with the world and all was absolutely right with Bristol. As ever. News bites Jeremy Clarkson says he has found a loophole in planning regulations which means he can now open a restaurant on his Diddly Squat Farm in Oxfordshire, despite having had an application turned down by the local council earlier this year. The ‘alfresco diner’ will be overseen by chef Pip Lacey of Hicce in King’s Cross and will attempt to use only ingredients from the estate, featured in his Amazon Prime show Clarkson’s Farm. There’s no menu, but according to the blurb on booking site OpenTable, ‘It’s small, mostly outdoors and very rustic. Ordering a beer and going to the lavatory isn’t as easy as in your local pub and we don’t cater to the faddy.’ The set menu costs £69 a head. For more, go here. Newcastle city council has introduced new rules stating that all pubs, bars and restaurants in the city which serve alcohol, have to provide staff finishing after 11.30pm with a taxi home. The provision of taxis for late-night staff will be a requirement of an alcohol licence. Newcastle is the first council in England to make the ruling, but follows similar schemes by two Scottish councils. The company behind Brighton’s Shelter Food Hall is opening a venue called Sessions in London’s Islington next month. It will feature just four outlets at any one time, run by a rotating roster of chefs.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(80,'2022-02-18T15:00:08Z','I’m so proud that Cumbria has become a foodie magnet | Grace Dent','As a Cumbrian, it’s almost surreal that the area has become a foodie magnet – chefs are going to live there because its restaurants are turning into the best in the world. In the 1980s, when I was growing up, eating out in Carlisle was a special occasion. You did it on your birthday and would get taken to Wimpy or the local Italian for garlic bread, spaghetti and a baked lasagne. The poshest places would be inside hotels, which were quite terrifying for working-class people like my family. You might go for your gran’s wedding anniversary, and you’d have a Florida cocktail and chicken breast – it was plain food. In the late 80s and early 90s, pubs in the countryside moved into food because they couldn’t live off beer profits as people didn’t drink and drive any more. That’s when we started going out more, but then it would be gammon with a slice of pineapple and chips, scampi in a basket and Sunday lunch. It makes me proud that everyone has started to turn up now and see Cumbria. Simon Rogan, whose restaurant L’Enclume has just won three Michelin stars, had the foresight to go to south Cumbria, and what he’s done is very metropolitan: a market garden and micro-nursery and bringing the ideas you usually find floating around Soho to the north. Cumbria has certainly become savvier at selling its amazing produce – for years we just accepted that we made incredible sausages, pies and cheese. When I go into Fortnum &amp; Mason now, Cumbrian things are front and centre, and I love that. You see Cumberland sausages on the menu in the best restaurants, and Cumbria is full to the brim with people living on the side of a mountain making exemplary honey. It’s become rather cool. There are now some really good places up near Carlisle, like Pentonbridge Inn and the Hidden River Cafe at Longtown, and there are lots of amazing places off the beaten track to be discovered. The Yan in Grasmere is a beautiful farm in the middle of nowhere: it’s not fancy but it’s hearty and the chef makes a Cumberland sausage platter that I absolutely love. I swear by Henrock in Bowness-on-Windermere: the scenery is incredible and they’ve spent millions on the art in the gardens. I had the “zero fashioned” cocktail, which was made with caramelised banana skins and caramelised banana syrup, grilled fillet of pollack with curried cauliflower and roast shrimp and lemongrass, and a chocolate, raspberry and peanut tart, which was amazing. Cumbrians have been swept up into this world. I’m not saying they don’t raise an eyebrow, but they’re up for it.','https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/18/grace-dent-im-so-proud-that-cumbria-has-become-a-foodie-magnet','Grace Dent','I’m so proud that Cumbria has become a foodie magnet | Grace Dent',-2.93355297999999997,54.8950614900000033,0.73460000000000003);

Starters £9-£14, mains £15-£32, desserts £6-£12, wines from £24 There are various things every town needs: a good bookshop run by people with serious reading habits; an independent mini-department store selling a seemingly random but vital collection of things for when you have to acquire both an emergency colander and a pair of leopard-print wellington boots at the same time; a well-positioned bus stop for bored teenagers to smoke in surreptitiously. And a restaurant exactly like Augustus in Taunton; a place which can serve for both special occasions, but also for an impromptu lunch with a mate; where the food is indulgent and diverting without being look-at-me showy; where the prices, while not exactly cheap, won’t make you gasp. In short, it’s a classy bistro that will look after you and make the world feel just that little bit better. You now want an Augustus in your town, don’t you? Quite right, too. The temptation for the travelling critic is to make Augustus sound like some breathless discovery. As it’s been doing its thing very happily since 2011, thank you, that would be pushing it. If the restaurant is less than well known nationally, it may be because Taunton is dominated by the venerable Castle Hotel, where the late Gary Rhodes first made his name, later to be followed by Phil Vickery. On a recent trip to Taunton to thrill the town with one of my fabulous, feather-boa-ed and burlesque live shows – get that image out of your head – the venue offered me a room at the Castle. I declined out of good manners. Twenty or so years ago I wrote about the place in what some would call a disobliging manner. The service and the eccentric approach to customer relations of the man then in charge made it an ordeal rather than a delight. It’s still owned by the same family, so I thought it better that I slope off to one of those good beds at the Premier Inn; I like a Premier Inn. After my extremely pleasurable lunch at Augustus, I looked back at that Castle review from 2000. I clocked the positive things I said about the food. Oh, the celebration of beef. I also clocked that the chef who cooked it all was Richard Guest. He subsequently left the Castle with his front-of-house colleague Cedric Chirrosel to open Augustus. It’s named not after Escoffier apparently, but Augustus Gloop, the chunky boy from Roald Dahl’s Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, because he liked his grub. Why do the ones with a healthy appetite always meet a sticky end in fiction? The restaurant is located in a quiet courtyard off one of Taunton’s pretty lanes, in a sleek space of painted brick and bare polished floorboard softened by strategic outbreaks of foliage and drapery. There’s a glass-walled extension out front and on a warm summer lunchtime the doors are thrown open. There’s a short à la carte with starters at around a tenner and mains about double that, supplemented by a fixed-price menu with two courses at £29 and three at £35, though you can mix and match. One starter sums up the approach: a dome of creamy scrambled egg comes draped in soft fillets of room-temperature smoked eel, the boisterous oils encouraged out by the warmth beneath. On top is a teaspoon full of shiny smoked herring roe. It’s surrounded by pale green fronds of frisée, like a choir boy’s ruff, and dressed with dribbles of spiced oil. It is the intensely comforting and domestic, that scrambled egg, raised up to something so much more glamorous and downright sexy. The other starter is a generous portion of freshly made butter-yellow tagliatelle, the ribbons tumbling over themselves, spun through with heaps of brown crabmeat and a hint of chilli, and topped by a pretty dice of chives. The bread rolls are warm. The butter is salty and not fridge cold. The wine list is short and to the point. The customers are relaxed and cared for. On the set menu, scribbled up on a blackboard, is the promise of “Somerset faggots”. I order them, even though I know it’s a promise which can easily be broken. The real thing is a product of domestic pig-keeping and the imperative to use the whole animal once slaughtered, which means they have to be big on the inner wibbly bits of the animal that the unenlightened run screaming from, and especially liver. The very best I’ve ever had came from Neath Market, south Wales. Historically, along with parts of the West Midlands, it was the focus for domestic pig keeping going back to the 19th century and beyond, so faggots became a speciality. The ones here were not some prissy, toned-down version. They were properly offaly and strident, and came with a glossy onion gravy and, to remind us of the chef’s classical chops, a beautifully glazed dauphinoise. Have some greens on the side to balance everything out. The other main was a piece of turbot, cooked with due care and respect, with a gruyère and herb crust, and an honour guard of broad beans and new potatoes. It was all brought together by a thick, rust-coloured bouillabaisse sauce that was a proper whack of trawler and dock. In a good way. And so to dessert, where none of those well-juggled balls were dropped. A coffee, chocolate and hazelnut éclair was an elegant piece of patisserie, the work of a man who has made an awful lot of crisp, light choux buns in his time. There were the just-contained whorls of both coffee cream and vanilla, and the vital chocolate topping. Or have a scoop of their vanilla ice-cream, with meringue, chantilly and freshly glazed raspberries, for it is summer in one of the greenest counties of England, where the fruit and the dairy is in abundance and these things make total sense. Which sums up the sweet joys of Augustus. It all makes sense. It is a quietly professional operation that does its job with grace and skill. I suppose if you wanted to rant at the terrible inequities of the world, you could go all 1968 and dismiss it as terribly bourgeois. To which I’d say: we’re in a courtyard in Taunton, opposite a hairdresser’s called Inside Out and a menswear shop called Astaire’s. Of course it’s bloody bourgeois, and so am I, your honour. Alternatively, you could just give yourself to it. Just come here to stop thinking about those iniquities, even if only for a couple of hours. News bites Oli Brown, chef founder of the Cantonese roast meats café Duck Duck Goose in south London’s Brixton, is undergoing a complete change of direction. Along with his partner Ruth Leigh, he is opening an outdoor restaurant with rooms at a farmhouse not far from Deal in Kent. From this month until the end of September, there will be a series of what they call ‘showcase events’ offering a hyper local, Italian-leaning menu. The restaurant proper will then open, housed under a vine and wisteria-clad pergola. There will be four bedrooms in the house (updownfarmhouse.com). The Ottolenghi empire has added a Hummus at Home Kit to its mail-order offering. The kit boasts both dried and jarred chickpeas but, more importantly, to justify the £45 price tag, a set of other ingredients including Ottolenghi tahini, Aleppo chilli flakes and Palestinian za’atar. There’s also the option to add a branded gift box to the order. Visit ottolenghi.co.uk. The famed le Manoir aux Quat’Saisons, chef Raymond Blanc’s luxury boutique hotel in Oxfordshire, has been granted planning permission for a major multimillion-pound development. There will be a total of 31 new buildings on the site, many of which will either house new suites or be part of a high-end spa.

Small plates £7-£11, large plates £9-£19, desserts £6, wines from £25 It is the simplest of dishes: half a dozen fat Cantabrian anchovies, the colour of well-varnished teak, lie in a pool of deep green olive oil, dotted with sparkling droplets of what turns out to be lemon juice. On the face of it, very little has happened to get this to our table. Some seriously good anchovies, meaty, salty and powerful specimens with a lingering depth of flavour, have simply been taken from their resting place, dressed and sent on their way. But there is so much more going on here; something that goes to the very heart of the best restaurants. It is an expression of exquisitely good taste. Sargasso, in Margate, is sodden with the stuff. It will not be everybody’s idea of good taste. Some will look at the squat, old redbrick building it calls home, and roll their eyes. They’ll dismiss as ugly this low-slung bruiser of a block hunkered by the sea wall along the harbour arm as it reaches out into the water. If they are of a rectally challenged demographic and familiar with certain over-the-counter ointments, they may whine about the hard, spindly stools that you are invited to sit upon while you eat at the counter, or at the high window tables. This general eye-rolling could be extended to the monogrammed plates, the restaurant’s name realised in a blood-red font that recalls the late 60s futurism of Joe 90. And let’s not forget the record player and the collection of 70s jazz funk vinyl cuts by the likes of Idris Mohammed and George Duke, which play upon it. The album cover is always displayed behind the bar so you know exactly what you are listening to while you eat. If all of this does not sound like your plate of Cantabrian anchovies, do not come here. You should not take the high-speed train from London’s St Pancras, as I did, for an early supper. Go elsewhere. The rest of you, get in. Sargasso, which is the second restaurant from chef Ed Wilson and the team behind Brawn on London’s Columbia Road, makes the very best things look very simple. The menu, divided between half a dozen small plates and a similar number of larger offerings, manages to reflect perfectly its hard-scrabble coastal setting. Some of it, like those glorious anchovies, to be eaten with the springiest of hard-crusted sourdoughs, is merely about the ingredients. Don’t forget to mop. There are others that have demanded more thought. Whipped cod’s roe, a wistful fondant-fancy pink, has been piped in buxom whorls across a thick piece of oily toast. Across that is a lawn of well-dressed peppery watercress. It is topped with a boiled egg, allowed to come to room temperature, but still with a sunset of runny yolk that pours out across it when you cut in. It feels like both serious attention to detail and huge care for £8. From that fishy side of the ledger comes a salad of crab, with finely shredded wild fennel, chives and other green herbs on a thick pond of sauce thickened with brown crab meat. You could, of course, merely stand outside on the harbour arm, and sniff the air here as the tide pulls out; take in the gull-clawed wind, rich with the saline pong of exposed seaweed and old boat diesel. Or you could sit in here, at a high top, staring out at the view and eat a sweet and funky expression of it. The joy, of course, is that by taking the walk to Sargasso you get a combination of the two. Add a bowl of their clams, with thick, soft slices of garlic and handfuls of coriander. Correctly, they bring a spoon so you can finish the ripe, snout-thumping broth like it’s a soup. There are other great things. Because it is the season, there is asparagus, served warm with a glass dish of lemony melted butter. Friggitelli peppers, Padrón’s longer Italian cousins, are given a little heat to help them wizen and soften, then dressed with flakes of sea salt and chilli. Parmesan fritters are squash-ball-sized béchamel croquettes, with centres of pure molten cheesiness, served hot from the fryer under a micro-planed drift of the best parmesan. It is finger food, designed by someone who believes a plate should be cleared. I get the message. I clear the plate down to that shiny monogram. Much of the wine list, which is as careful and intriguing a selection as at Brawn, is available by the glass and carafe. Behind the bar is a collection of spirits, including Aperol Spritz and Fernet-Branca; things that you might think are a good idea after a few carafes of the gentler wines. You’re an adult; make your own bloody choices. There are also piles of cookbooks, titles by Nuno Mendes, José Pizarro and, most pleasingly of all, Keith Floyd (on Italy). It’s that good taste thing all over again. Somewhere in a review of a restaurant in Margate there are meant to be a couple of paragraphs musing on a seaside town with a reputation for scruffiness, now undergoing gentrification. It’s such an obvious point it’s barely worth making beyond saying that yes, the coin arcades are still here on the front, and so is the Turner Contemporary. There are bucket-and-spade shops, and ironic takes on the bucket-and-spade culture. And there’s Sargasso, which in July shifts from opening on a Thursday to opening on a Wednesday. Perhaps across the summer they’ll be able to open throughout the week. I do hope so. Sometimes, when I tell people I play jazz piano, they tell me they hate jazz, as though it’s a mark of some form of clever, reverse sophistication. They often seem surprised when I tell them that’s fine. I feel absolutely no need to argue the case or convert them. They are the ones who are missing out. Their loss. I really do feel the same way about Sargasso. I can predict the reactions against it from those who flare their nostrils at what they regard as posturing. All that means is that they won’t get to eat those anchovies or that crab salad, in that building with those sounds and that view. At the end, with a final smart nod to the bucket-and-spade culture of Margate, there is soft-serve ice-cream, either with strawberry sauce or chocolate and hazelnuts. It suggests a less than vigorous interest in desserts by the kitchen here, but after such a great meal, they can be forgiven. News bites Sargasso is about to get a new neighbour. Staple, an independent bakery which launched its first outpost at the former village post office in Broadstairs in 2020 before expanding into Westgate-on-Sea last year, is to open two more next month. One is in Ramsgate and the other is in the building right next to Sargasso on Margate’s Harbour Arm. The menu, overseen by chef and baker Stephen Gadd, includes various sourdough loaves, their own croissant and Danish as well as a range of classic cakes (staplestores.co.uk). Clay’s Kitchen, the Indian restaurant in Reading which developed a nationwide following during lockdown for its home deliveries, has launched a crowdfunder to raise money for its new home. Sharat and Nandana Syamala have taken on the lease of a former Wetherspoon’s pub in Caversham and, having raised £250,000 themselves, are looking for the same again to finish the job. They are offering a bunch of rewards including vouchers, cooking classes, membership club subscriptions and venue hire. Find out more here. After 18 years, chef Marc Wilkinson is closing the much-admired Michelin-starred Fraiche in Oxton on Merseyside. Wilkinson, who famously cooks by himself, has said that all existing reservations will be honoured but no more will be released. The last service will be at the end of September. The Fraiche name will then be used for other projects (restaurantfraiche.com). • This article was amended on 26 June 2022.

Sure, this was once deemed London’s highest-earning postcode, but none of that was benefiting the restaurant world when the employees of its banks were working in pyjamas in Berkshire. And, pandemic aside, Canary Wharf has never been anyone’s idea of a charming dining destination, despite being in parts twinkly, luxurious and curiously Blade Runner-ish. To see it become the focus of big players such as Hawksmoor, Caravan, Marugame Udon and a new hulking Market Halls says a lot about how confident investors are of a return to desks. The days of dressing gowns and Joe Wicks workouts were officially over when Hawksmoor unveiled its most ostentatious opening to date: a vast, shimmering restaurant in Wood Wharf. Half steakhouse, half love boat, it floats on the water in the middle of 23 acres of residential and working space, currently heavily marketed as a place for Londoners to live, laugh, love and pedal their Pelotons in flats that cost £400k for a bijou one-bed. Caravan’s arrival suggests that there is an expectation that the wharf will no longer be a weekend ghost town, but instead a place to fritter your free time. The much-loved Patty &amp; Bun, purveyors of the Ari Gold burger, will arrive in May, while the increasingly cherished Emilia’s Crafted Pasta has just opened, and Six By Nico, about which I have already made my feelings clear, is gearing up to serve its multi-course Ancient Rome-themed tasting menu from mid-March. While heating bills and staff shortages have made buying a cup of coffee before 11am in Soho a gargantuan feat, over in E14, the all-day brunch is thriving. And on a wet, windy Wednesday night in February, it’s a push to get a table for two at Hawksmoor Wood Wharf. Perhaps what diners see in Hawksmoor is warm dependability. Yes, this new place may have the air of a New Orleans steam cruiser that has mated with an All Bar One, but it nevertheless offers the same high-quality porterhouse, T-bone and chateaubriand that have made diners open their wallets since 2006. Hawksmoor has danced a dainty jig over the past 16 years, expanding and becoming part of the food-scene furniture, while never quite straying to naffness. It remains to millions of people something of a treat – regardless that there are now branches in Edinburgh, Manchester and New York; that steak is as du jour to young people right now as Chico Time; and that the Angus Steakhouse in Covent Garden has been turned into a Mildred’s vegan restaurant. Unsurprisingly, Hawksmoor at Canary Wharf does not parade its trays of raw meat around the tables for the diners to ooh and ahh at. Instead, there’s a more discreet offering of now-departed cow, as well as a good selection of oysters with scotch bonnet mignonette, and roast oysters with bone marrow. The smoked mackerel salad with horseradish and new potatoes is great, as is the ash-baked beetroot with pickled fennel. A subtle repurposing of Hawksmoor seems to have gone on, almost undetected, over the past few years; with mains of charred romesco with hazelnuts, peanuts and sesame appearing on the menu, plus a very good charcoal-roasted halibut, which I’ve eaten on a couple of occasions with a side of very buttery mash and gravy, plus a lovable creamed spinach that wraps itself around your chest like a culinary cuddle. A visit to Hawksmoor may not be the glittering, braggable occasion it was 15 years ago, when you’d book months in advance for Sunday lunch and stagger out four hours later, packed tightly with prime rib. Yet there is still something reassuringly special about a secluded, flatteringly-lit table for two, a hunk of rare ribeye with anchovy hollandaise and some triple-fried chips, then the clotted cream and sticky toffee pudding sundae, which comes in a tall glass with two spoons, glistening with almost too much sauce and the suggestion that the Peloton torture can recommence tomorrow. We fought our way in through crowds at 5.30pm and, as we paid up, they promptly turned our table. In a food landscape filled with uncertainty, where many small restaurateurs are too scared to turn on their lights, Hawksmoor Wood Wharf is operating on full tractor beam, channelling ebullient, 100-watt certainty. I don’t know where we’re all going, but in Canary Wharf, at least for now, the future’s so bright, I’ve got to wear shades. Hawksmoor Wood Wharf, 1 Water Street, London E14, 020-3988 0510.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(86,'2021-12-03T12:00:05Z','Celentano’s, Glasgow: ‘A delightful hodge-podge’ | Grace Dent on restaurants','There are few things nicer than a clomp around Glasgow’s cathedral grounds on one of the year’s first crisp, bright autumnal mornings. On my way to eat at Celentano’s, the air was cold enough to flush the cheeks, while the skyline over the Necropolis, the nearby Victorian burial ground, was dreamily blue. The Necropolis, perched on a low hill, is the archly gothic backdrop that Whitby wishes it had. Yes, goths love Whitby, but let’s face it, it’s a seaside town and, just like daleks and triffids, goths fare badly on sand. These were the kind of thoughts with which I entertained myself as I sat alone in a graveyard, waiting for the nearby Italian-inspired Celentano’s to open for lunch. Chef Dean Parker and his wife Anna have recently pitched up in Glasgow, from London, where their names were linked with several spots I’ve loved and often returned. Parker was head chef at Darby’s, an NYC-style, Irish-influenced oyster bar and restaurant in the vicinity of the new American embassy in Vauxhall. It’s a spot to which I have pointed many people and their parents, for the fun as much as the pie and crisp beef fat potatoes; it’s a reliably good-quality establishment with astute cooking. Before that, Parker cooked at Sorella in Clapham, where I once stayed so long over lunch, drinking the house vermouth and eating gnocchi, that they closed and opened again for dinner. In fact, I hold Parker responsible for beginning my midlife addiction to affogato, or vanilla gelato drowned in hot espresso with a large shot of something boozysuch as Frangelico. An affogato isn’t big enough to be a proper course, I argue, so doesn’t strictly count as pudding, which means you can order a tiramisu, too. And now the Parkers have headed north, opening Celentano’s within Glasgow’s Cathedral House hotel, a rather sumptuous boutique residence built in old baronial style in 1896 and now rather tastefully restored, with eight rooms overlooking the cathedral and the Necropolis. Celentano’s is a split-level dining room with sage-green wooden panelling, original wooden floors and pretty black-and-white tiling around a sit-up bar area. It is serene, ever-so-slightly olde worldy and instantly likable. The menu is Italianish, in so much as it features pastas, cheeses, salumi and so on divided into antipasti, primi and secondi, but this is no red table-clothed, garlic-bread sort of establishment, and more a delightful hodge-podge of all of Dean Parker’s talents and eccentricities. On the “snacks” section of the menu, for example, there are slices of his gloriously pungent homemade pork and fennel salami, alongside chunks of lasagne fritti made with porcini and Cora Linn sheep’s cheese. Yes, fried lasagne. I am a convert. See also tiny doughnuts filled with a truly curious “jam” of salt cod and kimchi. In fact, it would be easy to stay in the snacks section alone, smearing Parker’s homemade chicken liver parfait on to fresh sourdough, or dipping it in the fine-quality Le Ferre olive oil, but I was dining alone, so needed to be judicious in my menu choices. If I went for a large bowl of charmingly slithery fresh pappardelle in a rich, cream-abundant Dexter beef sauce, would I possibly have room left for the hefty chunk of toasted honey cake with miso, pear and tonka bean gelato? And, if so, dare I fit in an antipasto of jerusalem artichokes with stracciatella and chanterelles? It was a risk, but she who dares wins. The pasta here is exquisite, as you might have guessed. There was a Mossgiel ricotta agnolotti with cavolo nero and squash that I’ll certainly return to try. The jerusalem artichokes were a little soggy and plated on a thick and almost-set earthy, taupe-coloured mushroom sauce that was titivated with the occasional green leaf. This was experimental, rather than safe, sating cooking, but it was very edible nevertheless. That toasted honey cake, by the way, was gorgeously chewy – think of a pleasing wodge of souped-up Soreen malt loaf with an oozing cream centre sat on a plinth of sweet pear and ice-cream, with a flickering note of umami from the miso. It is a great dessert. It’s very early days for Celentano’s, meaning now is a great time to book a table. In fact, it might be the perfect Saturday outing: there are 3,500 monuments to the deceased in the nearby Necropolis that you can spend an entire morning perusing, before wandering over to Celentano’s for lunch to honour the living. Life is short, cruel and bumpy, so make time for long lunches with friends that slide on into dinner time featuring honey cake, laughter and bowls of fresh, slippery pappardelle. You might as well. I’m not sure where we go after this life, and I know even less about the catering there. • Celentano’s 28–32 Cathedral Square, Glasgow G4, 0141-552 3519.

I did not want the pork-fat custard. I wasn’t entirely sure, earlier in the meal, that I wanted the razor clam and blood sausage on toast – it tasted like musky armpit – but in both cases I found myself nodding in acceptance, because Mendes’ restaurants are always a wild and educational ride. He has become famous and loved in the British food scene over the past decade for a shaggy, avuncular charm that masks a fervent mischief in his cooking, plus a noble urge to chivvy Britain past the piri piri and pastel de nata approach to Portugal. If Mendes did crack one day and simply dish up spicy chicken, croquettes and octopus, he would probably be richer than God, yet instead he persists with the likes of cured, room-temperature slivers of amberjack topped with orange and onion, or wild mushrooms in egg-yolk bread sauce alongside plates of pungent sheep’s cheese from Serra da Arrábida. And lest everything, to the British palate anyway, be a little wobbly and unstructured, there is Coombeshead Farm bread with vivid-pink, whipped pork fat to mop one’s plate. Each dish at Lisboeta comes with a story from each server about their mother or grandmother or great aunt who cooked this very egg-yolk sauce or lamb chanfana stew every Sunday, because Mendes has created a slice of deeply personal Portugal here, and the staff can’t help themselves. So as you begin the chanfana - a dark bowl of lamb shoulder slow-cooked in red wine with turnip tops and chunks of bread – they approach to recount tales of their childhood. The emotion is sort of exhausting, but Grace Jones and the Clash were playing loudly in the bathroom, so I hid in there occasionally. On a Monday night, in mid-spring, Lisboeta was jam-packed, because wherever Mendes goes, the food crowd follows. He was once the chef at Chiltern Firehouse, a sort of celebrity safari park, which I always thought was a peculiar fit, because Mendes really cared about cooking and the clientele cared only about staring at each other’s table and hoping to seeing Romeo Beckham or Lindsay Lohan. Mendes was bringing the intensity of Ferran Adrià – whom he cites as an influence – and his clientele were pushing salad leaves around the plate while uploading toilet selfies. Before that, Mendes opened Viajante, where diners first saw his real passion for showcasing Portugal, but with Japanese, Iberian and South American influences. Later, at Mãos, he offered an intense, three-hour, seasonal tasting menu to only 16 people at a time. Lisboeta, by comparison, feels like a breezier, more down-to-earth space. It isn’t remotely cheap: that very delicious, deeply satisfying lamb stew is £44, to serve two, although a single hungry person could easily demolish it; a side of charlotte potatoes is a further £6. A delightful, crumbly Goan-spiced pork pie is as big as a baby’s palm and comes in at £3 a mouthful. However, as rents and bills increase in restaurants, I am growing inured to dishes being stretched, styled and described to feel much larger than they are once you remove the leaves and garnish. At Lisboeta, there are hits and misses, but I certainly left more learned on authentic Portuguese dining. Do I like the wobbly, porky, milky, egg yolk custard on a bed of blood-red port caramel? Not especially. It tastes precisely as it sounds: like a bacony Bird’s trifle. But do I support Mendes’ indefatigable urge to serve it? Yes, I do. With all my heart. It’s tough out there for mavericks right now, and we have to applaud them. Even if the bacalhau à brás – confit cod with caramelised onion and potato – tastes the same as one of those 1980s cod portions that we boiled in bags. Despite all these things, Lisboeta is an intimate, gently challenging attempt to bring the vibrant traditions of Portugal to UK palates, with Mendes at the helm offering his typical twinkly-eyed tricks. There are much worse places to order a white port and tonic and half a dozen pork pies as you watch the London food scene waltz past. The service is charming and prompt, the music is great and Mendes will most likely be behind the pass, because it’s beyond doubt that, when it comes to his restaurants, he cares deeply. His pork custard will most definitely be cited on end-of-2022 restaurant round-ups. And rightfully so. It was unforgettable. • Lisboeta, 30 Charlotte Street, London W1, 020-3830 9888.

Snacks and small plates £3.50-£10.50, big plates £7.50-£14.50, desserts £4.50-£6, wines from £25 Can you enjoy a good meal in a bad building? Especially if you know that the building has been nicknamed “the dog turd” by many in the city? That’s not exactly an aid to the digestion, is it? Let’s get specific. Can you enjoy a meal at Ka Pao, a boldly eclectic southeast Asian bistro where they thrill you with big flavours and thrill you again, when it’s located inside a shopping centre like Edinburgh’s St James Quarter? The delightful dog turd soubriquet is attached to the bronzed coil rising to a peak, atop the new W Hotel, part of the £1bn retail development. It’s true that the Scottish capital, which still applies the word “new” to districts which started going up more than two centuries ago, is not massively keen on major architectural change. But there’s no denying the impact of that aspect of the St James Quarter on the skyline. Once you’re told that the bronze coil resembles the poop emoji it’s really very hard to see anything else. A petition to add googly eyes to complete the emoji look received unsurprising amounts of support. They could still do it. In reality the serious issues with the development lie not with the bronzed poopy coil, which you can always point and laugh at, but with everything else back at street level. There’s no doubting the effort and expense that has gone in to creating the new limestone-clad buildings: the huge curving shopping gallerias with their vaulting glassed roofs, home to the likes of H&amp;M and Peloton and a new space for John Lewis, the Everyman cinema and the Bonnie &amp; Wild food market. It is meant to be a joyous, elegant urban retail “experience”, akin to Roppongi Hills in Tokyo. In truth it’s just a bloody great, soulless shopping centre, calculated to make you think long and hard about your life choices. When I was 10 years old Brent Cross shopping centre opened in Neasden, a manageable 182 bus ride from my house. I thought there was nothing cooler than sitting by the central fountains there and eating cheesecake from the Lindy’s concession. The problem is, I’m no longer 10 years old. I no longer think shopping centres are cool. I have been to Westfield. It didn’t make me like myself. Still, these places are full of units that need filling and not just with shops. In come restaurants on preferential leases: branches of Pho, Wingstop, Five Guys and Itsu. And tucked away on the fourth floor which, courtesy of Edinburgh’s hills and a delicate rip in space and time, somehow also manages to be at street level, is Ka Pao. The first Ka Pao, which is Thai for holy basil, was opened in Glasgow in 2020 by the team behind the Middle Eastern-cum-Mediterranean accented Ox and Finch. That first Ka Pao occupies a dreamy art deco building, which is so gorgeous it was saved from demolition by a feverish local campaign. The interiors of both boast girders and ducting and booths, but where the Glasgow version looks like a response to the heritage of the building, in Edinburgh all the sharp edges feel like the only possible option. Thank God for the leather-clad banquettes, which soften things. I’m aware it seems a little mean to bang on about the environment when the borderless cooking here is a proper slap about the chops. It’s bold and exciting, every dish a bang of flavour and intent. You are experienced people of the world so you will know they serve sharing plates delivered in no particular order. Raging at this is like shouting at the wind to stop blowing the trees, à la Elton John. I am not yet that man. Give me time. I ordered eight sharing plates, if you include the sticky chilli and lime leaf cashews and peanuts, which you should. I could easily have ordered an entirely different eight dishes. The most diverting, for £6, are corn cobs quartered lengthways, then grilled and slathered with a sweet salty coconut, shrimp and lime sauce. Eat them as you would spare ribs. Protect your shirt. Long-roasted pork belly turns up a few times. In a fresh, peppery and sour salad of watercress and sorrel the pieces are lightly battered and deep fried. In a curry of monkfish cheeks, it’s in meaty cubes, and comes in a broth with an uncompromising chilli kick which recalls the best brow-dampening dishes of northern Thailand. Stir-fried minced venison and pork with lime leaf and lemongrass, much like that great Laotian mince meat salad larb, comes threaded with red bird’s eye chillies and what I take to be handfuls of their green siblings. I pick my way around them, fearing the burn. Eventually I try one. It’s the finest of mellow green beans. I dig in. Florets of cauliflower are roasted and presented in a deeply spiced broth, then topped with a nest of deep-fried shredded potato for texture. There is a roughly chopped salad of cucumber, chilli, lime and peanuts with just the right burst of acidity. This is what I tried. I could have tried the fried chicken with spicy caramel, or the whole grilled sea bream with a herb salad and green nam jim, or the hispi cabbage with cashew nut butter and sriracha, or the salt and sichuan pepper oyster mushroom. Tables of four can order a sharing menu of a dozen dishes for £27.50 a head, and there’s a lunch menu at £17.50. The cocktails, mostly at £8.50, include lime leaf and palm sugar, coconut and chilli and cassia bark. I settle for a lemongrass and lime soda as I have a long train journey ahead and don’t want to be the snoring, dribbling drunk in coach L. We finish with a light cardamom and almond sponge with a zesty basil and lime curd, and a soothing palm sugar panna cotta with pineapple, papaya and mango. Then at the end I pay the very reasonable bill and find myself out once more in a brightly lit shopping centre, being enticed by the promise of Calvin Klein underpants that won’t fit me, and Miele ovens I simply can’t afford. During the day it’s a pretty gloomy way to finish a nice lunch. After dinner, when I imagine the whole space is a deserted wasteland echoing only to the crunch of metal on stone provided by skateboarders grateful for the new addition to the built environment, it would, I’m afraid, sour what should otherwise be a beguiling experience.

At one point in history, “going down Le Pont” was synonymous with low-key luxury: it was a reassuringly expensive French restaurant in a converted tea warehouse, serving lobster thermidor and, more importantly, offering on-the-ball, high-calibre French-style service. This was a rare treat in those days, because, for almost the entire 20th century, the British idea of front-of-house involved a woman with a Rothmans kingsize in her mouth lobbing a pork-tongue ploughman’s in the general direction of your table. So, it was interesting late last month to hear that Le Pont had expanded and opened an exciting new bistro next door that offered more pocket-friendly versions of French classics such as comte gougeres, duck confit with peas à la française and plats du jour such as rabbit parmentier and ray wing au poivre. Escoffier recipes at Ivy Brasserie prices, it seemed to say. The huge restaurant chain that owns Le Pont wasn’t very forthcoming with details of this grand refurbishment, but suffice to say we should all get down there sharpish to eat steak frîtes while savouring fabulous views of the lovely Thames. And, despite the fact that the Thames is, in fact, filthy and the last lovely thing that happened there was the Great Frost Fayre in 1683, I booked a table for Sunday lunch, not least because I love it when good rejigs happen to old, tired, unfashionable places. The alarm bells started when we walked the length and breadth of the walkway outside Le Pont de la Tour looking for the bistro. Was I at the wrong address? It wouldn’t be a first. I asked the restaurant staff, who pointed me to a drab doorway leading to the bar area. “That’s the bistro?” I asked. “Yes,” they replied. “The bistro is the bar area.” “Ah,” I said, and it suddenly all became very clear: there is no “brand new” Le Pont Bistrot. It does not exist. It is an imaginary bistro. Food is merely being served in the recently annexed bar area, which needed modernising a decade ago, with all the scabbled leather seating, mottled mirrors and damp bathrooms with broken soap dispensers knocked out and hurled into a skip. Instead, it looked like all of 7p had been spent on this particular “refurbishment” – that being the cost of the ink to print out the new menu. We were led to an unclean leather banquette at a wobbly table. Our server brought a bottle of water that skidded about on its surface. “This table is wonky,” I said. “Can we move over there?” “Oh, I think those are wonky, too,” she said, taking my order for salade cressonnière, a lesser-spotted classic out of the Escoffier cookbook, because someone, somewhere did at one point intend this place to be brilliant. The cressonnière, it must be said, was rather pretty, featuring duck egg, ratte potatoes and a gribiche dressing of egg yolks, pickled cucumbers, parsley and chervil. However, by the time Charles’s asparagus mimosa appeared – a forgettable arrangement of spears with a fringe of chopped egg – our small table was rather crowded. Mains were less successful. Charles chose the £26 Sunday roast, and was given the crusted end of a Cumbrian beef rump that had, for the the whole time, been curling under the heat lamp, and that came with some unlovable potatoes, green beans and a thin jus. We are truly in an age when the best place to eat Sunday lunch may well be at home. My grilled plaice was overdone to unbearably mushy, which made it impossible to pull the skeleton from the soft, wet flesh. On the plus side, it came with a caper beurre noisette that had definitely been given some care and attention. The three unseasoned purple potatoes alongside were, however, upsetting. Past this point in the meal, service all but evaporated, despite there being only two other tables to deal with. Regardless, I did demand un petit pot au chocolat. Eagle-eyed readers might have noticed that I have had several aborted attempts to order something sweet of late – staff shortages and general flakiness have turned pudding into something strictly for those willing to stand their ground – and, thankfully, a plate of long, thin, buttery, egg white and caster sugar langues de chat biscuits appeared (as I’ve already mentioned, someone, somewhere does have some standards) with a ready-made chocolate pot that was absolutely inoffensive and sweetened me up when someone else’s cocktails were added to our bill. For a bistro that doesn’t wholly exist – or at least not in the manner expected – Le Pont still managed to prise £112.93 out of my purse, including £13.43 for service.

Snacks and small plates £3-£9, large plates £14-£24, dessert £6, wines from £31, beers £5-£6 When chefs Andrew Clarke and Daniel Watkins announced their latest venture together, in London’s Dalston, it was described as: “More than just a restaurant.” Really? What is it then? An amusement park? A fetish club? A branch of Ikea? One of those might prove handy. “It’s a cult.” Oh my. In fairness, if you were hunting for a London cook to head up a raging, devoted religious movement, Clarke would fit the bill. He has a foot-long beard that can house small mammals or be plaited into viable rope, and so many tattoos that he’s become a walking secular challenger to the Sistine Chapel ceiling. Or perhaps not. While he might make a good figurehead, I know him to be a thoughtful chap, who probably wouldn’t be comfortable with all the coercive control a true cult demands. He has been involved with significant projects tackling mental health issues in and around the hospitality business, and has talked in a compelling way about his own challenges. So take the bombast of the name Acme Fire Cult with a pinch of quality, artisanal sea salt. It really isn’t more than a restaurant. There are tables and chairs, both in the functional dining room and on the rugged deck outside, where heat lamps dangle. There are menus and waiters. You order and they bring, from the wood-fired grill outside, their only kitchen. It’s an interesting development in the live-fire cookery movement, which Clarke helped popularise through the much glossier St Leonard’s restaurant he ran with Jackson Boxer in Shoreditch. For obvious reasons to do with the caveman imagery of burning logs and woolly mammoths, live fire cookery has associations with hunks of meat. If you have the time, it can be a good way to cook the cheaper cuts from corners of the animal that, having worked harder, have more connective tissue, and need longer to break down. There is some of that on this menu, developed during a series of pop-ups over the past couple of years. For the most part, however, it is thrillingly, impressively vegetable led, part of a self-declared determination to get away from the whole “dude food” culture around fire and smoke. For this reason, I want it to be so much more than a cult, because cults tend to implode quickly under the weight of their own filthy impropriety. This needs to endure. Acme is also a collaboration with 40ft Brewery with whom they share a space, in a rough old yard next to the Dusty Knuckle Bakery, the wellspring for much of north London’s overly developed sourdough habit. The brewery doesn’t just provide beers to go with the food. By-products from brewing, such as yeast and spent grains, are used to make ferments and sauces. So far, so achingly “grim up north London”, for the Private Eye readers among you. Statement of the obvious: none of this would be important if the food wasn’t good. A great beard, tats and leaping flames do not dinner make. Happily, much of it is good. We start with their devilled eggs. Mary Berry would, I think, give these a basilisk stare. The traditional 1960s stalwart involved the boiled eggs being halved, the yolks removed, mixed with mayo and cayenne pepper and so on, whipped and returned. Here, the eggs have been cooked so the yolks have reached a perfect jellied state. They have then been drenched in a sweet-sour tamarind-like sauce and scattered with crisply fried onions. Even though I wished the devil to have more of a voice, a theme in a number of dishes which shy away from chilli heat, I could do damage to successive servings of these. They also make their own Bombay mix. It’s rich in toasted peanuts and cashews, which are usually in short supply for cost reasons. There is a certain amount of what could come across as innovation for its own sake among the small plates, except it all works. Leeks are grilled until the point of surrender, when they are sweet and soft. They are then served at room temperature with their own version of romesco sauce, in which the ground almonds have been substituted with ground pistachios. It’s a study in verdant shades of green. There’s a welcome acidity to the grainy romesco. New potatoes have been smoked and are lubricated by a tahini mayo and a nutty chilli oil or rayu, made with grains from the brewery. Grilled cauliflower florets come in a ripe, buttery Indian-accented mess of a sauce under ribbons of pickled onion. Meat and fish do not appear on the menu until the large plates. There’s mutton merguez with a wild garlic salsa verde, the ingredients for which I pray have not been harvested from the fox-sprayed canal verges of Dalston. There’s a Tamworth pork chop and a whole butterflied mackerel. We order the ox cheek. It’s the least whelming of dishes. The mustard greens have heft and there’s a powerful umami-tastic ancho chilli koji condiment. But the cheek simply hasn’t spent long enough on the grill. It fights back against the knife and fork. It almost wins. So much better is the hearth vegetable plate, a fabulous collection of beefy roasted tomatoes, courgettes and fennel, with white beans and squash purées, dressed with another big old salsa verde. This singular £14 dish makes the argument for the whole venture. It is a demonstration of the virtuous interplay of the best vegetables and the most acutely managed indirect heat and smoke. There is just one dessert tonight: a deep, dark chocolate ganache topped by hazelnuts and a beer molasses. It’s impressively powerful, but could have done with a soothing dollop of chilled whipped cream. It’s clear they want you to get deeply stuck into the brewery’s offering with this food: into beers with names like Dalston Sunset and Disco Pils, all at £5 or £6 a pint. There are only half a dozen wines, and the cheapest white, a dry Tokaj, is £38 a bottle, which is unfriendly. It’s also at odds with the reasonable food pricing. Perhaps they simply don’t care much about wine drinkers – which is, I suppose, fair enough. Then again, I came here for dinner, rather than for an act of unquestioning cultist worship. And dinner, a really engaging one, is what they gave me. I may not be a devout follower of the cult. I may not be on my knees before the blessed grill. But I do have faith. News bites The onward march of top steak continues. Hawksmoor have announced that, following openings in Manchester, Edinburgh and New York, they are now expanding into Liverpool. The steakhouse group has always utilised grand buildings with history and the same is true again. Hawksmoor Liverpool will be located inside the Grade II-listed India Building on the corner of Brunswick and Fenwick Streets and will open later this year. ‘It’s an amazing site,’ co-founder Will Beckett has said. ‘We’re really excited to do it justice’ (thehawksmoor.com). The ever-interesting chef Jay Morjaria is on to his next project. Having finished his Korean-inspired residency JAE at Untitled bar in London’s Dalston in February, he has now opened at the Shelter Hall food market on Brighton’s seafront. Tiger and Rabbit offers Morjaria’s take on Korean barbecue, with rice, lettuce wraps and appropriate condiments, including samjang aioli and kimchi (shelterhall.co.uk). And while there are new openings, there’s also bleak news. According to accountancy firm Price Bailey, more than 1,300 British restaurant became insolvent in the year to the end of March 2022. This was a significant rise on the previous 12 months, when 926 restaurants went bust. The increase has been attributed to the end of the government’s various programmes to support the industry through the pandemic.

Some time after the first plates of starters at a new opening, such as at Kibou in Battersea last week, I often find myself staring into a bathroom mirror – a freshly installed bathroom mirror, mind – and the words are already bubbling, because when you know, you already know. Kibou’s new south London branch is the third in a chain of beautifully staged, Japanese-inspired restaurants with a loyal following in Cheltenham and Bristol. The Battersea branch has two enormous, fluttery lashed, mascara-laden eyes painted on to its Hague Blue frontage. Those eyes are made prettier still by faux Japanese rose blossom. Kibou is certainly, from the outside and at night, the loveliest, quirkiest-looking new opening London has seen in a while. Inside, vast murals of Tokyo metropolitan life brighten the walls. The best seats in the house are the booths at the back, bedecked with even more faux blossom. Romantic as heck. But it’s less so if you’re seated near the front door on one of the tiny, draughty, exposed tables. But then this restaurant is very much a place of contradictions. Kibou markets itself as a non-serious place – ideal for groups, they say – that’s deadly serious about sushi, as well as, well, many, many other things. So many dishes. Kibou’s sushi offering alone is plentiful, with a dozen types of nigiri, alongside hosomaki and futomaki rolls, gunkan, temaki and, of course, sashimi, with plates coming in around the £8 to £13 mark, and larger sharing rolls, such as the 10-piece “Volcano” – salmon, avocado and tobiko dipped in tempura – at about £18. If Kibou were solely a sushi restaurant, it could be a pleasant enough place to grab a plate of the absolutely fine hamachi nigiri or scallop sashimi, while accepting that it will arrive almost instantly and be served by someone who appears to know absolutely nothing about the menu, but is at least smiling. The menu is vast, however, and offers dozens of the crowd-pleasing, Asian-inspired dishes you see in chains such as Wagamama, Tonkotsu and Yo! Sushi. Kibou does bao buns, chicken karaage with sriracha mayo and baked aubergine nasu dengaku alongside gyoza, eel yakitori skewers and agadashi tofu, and that’s before you even get to the ramen, donburi bowls and yaki udon sections. Clearly, there’s a lot happening here, and a lot of covers to cater for, which is ambitious, and things such as agadashi tofu – which is meant to be crisp, fried soft tofu perched in an umami broth – are easy to get very wrong. At Kibou, it came in flabby lumps, thinly battered in potato starch, topped with chopped spring onion (rather than bonito) and sitting in a slightly anonymous puddle. Seconds later, teeth-chatteringly sweet, soggy aubergine nasu dengaku arrived, accompanied by a brazenly inedible “seasonal mushroom tempura” bao that sounded delicious on the menu, but turned out to be an almost raw, breadcrumbed portobello mushroom sandwiched in a very non-pillowy bao bun. Next, some overcooked chicken karaage arrived, recently refreshed in a deep-fat frier, with an unobtrusive pink mayo that was rumoured to have once met sriracha. Pale, wobbly prawn gyoza “pot stickers” arrived without even the merest of sears. It was at this point that I excused myself to go to the ladies’ room, where the towel on the old-fashioned roller dispenser on the wall had been pulled out and trailed along the floor, to have a long think about my life choices and, more specifically, about how the likes of Tonkotsu can bang out perfect chicken karaage on a mass scale, deftly and accurately at any hour of the day, and how my favourite small Korean chain Yori can offer heavenly kimchi jeon pancakes every time, regardless of who made them and when. And yet other restaurants, once they expand, have a tough time nailing their popular dishes. Even so, it is undoubted that Kibou, in its outside-London forms, at least, inspires a lot of customer love. Almost everything we ordered came in the space of five minutes, including those lukewarm eel yakitori skewers drizzled in yuzu. Fresh sea bream sashimi, served with a hostile and, for that reason, awesome wasabi, was the greatest thing on the table. I’d also ordered the yaki udon, but fortunately they forgot to bring it, because, at £92 down already and without alcohol, it felt a good time to head for the door. Kibou in Battersea has a lot of room for improvement before it will inspire the sort of adoration and dependability that it gets in its other locations, but if you’re up for a party atmosphere, cocktails, nice photographs of fake flowers and a place to take groups who won’t quibble over the details, then, in its current form, you’ll be well suited. • Kibou 175-177 Northcote Road, London SW11, 020-7223 8551.

Snacks and starters £9-£30, mains £27-£49, desserts £14, wines from £38 Welcome to wonderland. Or perhaps, to be more precise, AdLand. For here at NoMad London, everything is art-directed to within an inch of its life. The public rooms are beautiful. The food is beautiful. Therefore, I too must be beautiful. There is handpainted wallpaper and dark wood and velvet plush and oxblood leather and acres of marble. The shelves in the library upstairs are filled with real books, of a sort you might want to read. They are an expression of literary taste, rather than something bought by the metre. The conversion of what was, until 2006, the Bow Street Magistrates Court where Oscar Wilde was once held, is magnificent. Not that they’d be so gauche as to show it off. Just as with the original NoMad hotel in New York, the lighting here is moody, verging on the dark, verging on: “Oh God am I suffering from macular degeneration?” No, you’ve merely chosen to go out for dinner in central London in 2022. Given the vertiginous rise in energy prices, this could be taken as an economically savvy move, masquerading as a style statement. Except economy is not exactly part of the mission statement. I should say that, while I’m obviously going to point and laugh at various things along the way, I had a lovely time at NoMad. But bloody hell it’s expensive. As in: who are all these other people paying for their own tea and which offshore tax haven are they using? When I pick up the bill at the end of an evening and cringe at the very thought of putting through the expenses claim, I know something’s up. I love my time with the leather-aproned and expertly coiffed barman downstairs, who serves us a perfectly made ice-cold daiquiri for £16 and a single glass of rosé pinot noir for £15. I appreciate that he went to get us a bowl of olives from the bar upstairs, because down here the only snacks available are smoked trout rillettes for £16 or fried chicken for £19 and so on. I enjoy being wafted from that bar area into the vast three-storey atrium that houses the restaurant. It has about it a touch of the New Orleans French Quarter. It is edged by a stack of colonnaded balconies from which foliage drips. Illumination comes from hanging lanterns and guttering candles and carefully positioned spots. There are squishy velvet banquettes in shades of olive and chartreuse. They are so squishy, we have to construct a litter out of the scatter cushions to raise our height to something manageable against that of the table. Ah, that’s better. I won’t bang on about the prices, save to say starters top out at £30, mains include a roast chicken for two at £98 and there’s nothing on the wine list below £38 a bottle. It is what it is. But I detect a mismatch here. Do the people thronging these tables really care about this serious thumper of a wine list, clearly constructed by a total nerd, with their pronounced interest in skin-contact wines? And do the punters care about the serious, precise effort that has gone into the food? Among the starters are deep-fried baby globe artichokes, in the Roman style, with a carefully acidulated mint and pistachio sauce that has been passed to a velvety smoothness. Taut slivers of cured mackerel rest under candy-coloured ribbons of pickled vegetables, so the plate looks like an explosion in a dressmaker’s. Curls of crispy seaweed add a layer of texture, alongside beads of toasted buckwheat. It’s a true stunner. As, in its own way, are pillowy ricotta gnudi, liquid at their centre, with freshly podded broad beans, a brilliant green broad bean purée, the whole lifted by gratings of the much-prized bottarga, the cured and dried roe of the grey mullet. Greedily, we pull apart the domed loaf of bouncy focaccia and use it as a vehicle for the bowl of whipped goat’s curd. A rectangle of confit pork, with crackling like set butterscotch, and a roasted chop, is advertised as coming with strawberries, the sort of innovation people shake their heads at. Except it’s masterful, the acidity and the sweetness playing catch up with each other. A plate of fat grilled scallops with crushed peas, minted pea purée and carrots under mandolined discs of multicoloured carrot is a study in green, orange and purple. I stare out into the room, at the flash of jewellery and the shine of leather trouser. How many of these diners are here for the details on these plates and how many for the scene? Dance music thrums, gently vibrating our lower colon as if attempting to make space for our dinner. Most of my fellow diners are, like me, through the first flush of youth. They have to be or they couldn’t afford it. I doubt many would choose to listen to this music at home. But here they are, among all the shiny surfaces and the saggy cushions, wearing young people’s clothes with a wide-eyed desperation. We sigh over our side dish, a spectacularly well-made semicircle of potato rosti, the crisply rugged exterior giving way to the soft oniony innards. We frown over our desserts because the grace and technique deployed with every other dish suddenly disappears. Part of the problem is that while they read nicely, they are mostly assemblages of crumbed things and iced things. The other problem is, weirdly, a heavy hand with the salt. A blood orange sorbet with shards of meringue has a salty tang, as does the crumbled banana and pecan cake with a milk chocolate crémeux. It’s just odd. At the bottom of the dessert menu there’s a box which reads: “Night at the NoMad. Price Upon Request.” I ask our perfectly poised waiter what this means. She makes a delicate speech about pleasure coming at the end of the meal. If the date is going really well, some of those pleasures might need to be taken away from the table. She opens her eyes wide as if inviting me to finish the sentence, mentally. Ah. If you want to shag your dining companion you can get a room, price on request. I ask: she goes away to check. It’s £495. But the bill is already £309 and our own bed is only a couple of miles south. It’s a menu item too far. We pay, dance back up the moodily lit stairs, out through the front doors once used by Oscar Wilde, and back into the real world. News bites The ever-marvellous Sonny Stores in Bristol is staging a series of guest chef takeovers. First up on 17 May is Danny Bohan, head chef of the famed River Café in London’s Hammersmith, where Pegs Quinn of Sonny Stores also cooked for many years.

The days of long queues for Matilda the Musical, pre-theatre set menus and Yoda street performers were over for ever, I was certain. Patently, I was an idiot, because full high-octane tourist bedlam has now been restored, and an all-new Lahpet has entered the fray down one of the newly prettified sidestreets off Long Acre. This cool, casual, modern restaurant, which serves Burmese comfort food, was founded by Dan Anton and Burmese chef Zaw Mahesh, and began life as a stall on Maltby Street near London Bridge, before moving first into an arch in Hackney and then to a popular restaurant in Shoreditch; this new, double-floored affair on Slingsby Place is their most ambitious project to date. (Incidentally, if you have a passing knowledge of London, it’s about three minutes’ walk from Pineapple Dance Studios, and probably less if you did it exuberantly in leg warmers.) The delicious and, for Brits, often intriguing and lesser-explored flavours of Myanmar are a welcome addition to the Yards, Covent Garden’s spanking new shopping precinct. Here, a flashy, multi-floored, glass-fronted but ultimately unappealing Caffè Concerto sits close to the bland yet reliable all-day brunch spot Bill’s; there’s also a Dishoom (ever dependable, but completely oversubscribed) and a sleek Italian wine bar, Dalla Terra. But this repurposed nook of Covent Garden feels brazenly unbothered by its place in the capital, because the Yards could really be anywhere: a mall in Dubai, say, the Newcastle Metro Centre or one of those faceless retail strips featuring a Roly’s Fudge outlet and a shop that sells pleasant jumpers. It’s a brave, but utterly welcome move to open a joint that serves lahpet thohk (tea-leaf salad) and a contemporary take on mohinga, a traditional rice-noodle fish soup, which here is delightfully spicy (they will warn you about that if you order it). It perhaps needs saying that Lahpet is one of London’s very few purveyors of Burmese cuisine, now that the Mandalay Golden Myanmar in Kilburn seems to be permanently closed (Kiln, the much-loved Thai grill on Brewer Street, occasionally has Shan tofu and a restorative Burmese pork belly curry on the menu, but is perhaps a little experimental for purists). The sterling work of Burmese food writers and supper-club legends the Rangoon Sisters has gone a long way towards introducing us to the specifics of this country’s food – the crunchiness, the delicate sourness, the breakfast soups, the complex salads and, maybe my favourite thing about this cuisine, the glorious, rapturous brown-ness and mauve-ness. That lahpet thohk salad is a sterling example of this delightful funkiness, with pickled tea leaves interwoven with double-fried beans,wisps of chopped cabbage, plump, sweet bursts of tomato and salty dried shrimp; sesame seeds, crunchy peanuts and a liberal amount of garlic oil and raw garlic also put in an appearance. To a western gaze, at least, this might be unlike any salad seen before, plus it’s the colour of Fozzie Bear and army-surplus combat pants. It comes with a warning that, due to the level of caffeine in it, it may well keep you up at night. Each time I order lahpet thohk, I’m unsure I love it, but I am always compelled to scoop up every last complex, enticing bite. We also had all three of the grilled skewers, which are frankly incredible; in fact, a dinner of just these skewers and a couple of cocktails would be an evening well spent. The chicken thigh is outstanding and the black tiger prawns, heads and shells on, are impressively fragrant and charred; the Shan tofu fritters, with a finely judged tamarind dip, are also well worth having. The place was heaving with families, children, gossiping friends and giggling groups, and the music was heroically 1980s, with a strong line in the finest clever pop and electro. As Smalltown Boy by Bronksi Beat merged into Talking Heads’ And She Was, it was almost as if they’d seen me coming. I cleared a bowl of Rakhine mohinga, which could possibly be described as a sort-of chowder full of grilled squid, green beans, half a boiled egg and a good nose-blast of chilli. If you’re passing and just want a cuddle in a bowl, however, go for the coconut noodles with chicken, because it’s a heartwarming, sweetly satisfying coconut broth packed with egg noodles, shallots, perhaps too much spring onion and armed with a very good, ornate, crispy wonton. Puddings, on the other hand, are not up to much – banana parfait was a sort of deconstructed cheesecake that was less than the sum of its parts – but then, that’s the way of things with so many places in the West End these days. But it’s not enough to stop Lahpet Covent Garden now being officially one of my safe places to hide from the jugglers and those people who aggressively punt cut-price haircuts. Yes, it sells caffeine-heavy salad, but some things are worth staying awake for. • Lahpet 21 Slingsby Place, London WC2, 020-4580 1276. Open all week noon-10pm (9pm Sun).

His name is Matthew. He is thin and pale and blond, and trembling a little from the cold. Sue Anayiotou, who has owned and run this cafe with her husband Chris these past 31 years, turns at the sound of the door, checks him out and turns back to me. “Homeless. I’ll just be a minute.” Matthew asks for a fried egg sandwich. She offers him a cup of tea to go with it. He nods, gratefully. No money changes hands, because no money is required. In the window is a red and white sign, designed in the early months of the pandemic by a regular customer, which reads: “Pay it forward, donate a meal for someone who needs it”. Beneath that it says: “Free Hot Meals for anyone who cannot afford one. Just come in and ask.” Which is what Matthew has done. “Sometimes there will be one of them,” says Sue. “Sometimes six.” The customer who designed the sign also put the first £200 into the pot and it’s grown from there. It’s an appropriately dignified start to a working day at a cafe called the Hope. The Hope Workers Cafe on London’s Holloway Road first opened in 1937 and is what some people might call a greasy spoon. Those people include its owners. “Well, of course it’s a greasy spoon,” says Chris, as he sears rashers on the hot plate for the day’s first bacon sandwich. “It’s not a restaurant, is it?” Chris is 64. He’s broad and stocky and salt-and-pepper stubbled, and given to blunt, mildly world-weary statements. I watch him cut fat off the bacon with the sharp edge of his scraper, his key tool for the lengthy parade of breakfasts that will fly out of here today. He can flip the eggs with it, and shimmy the sausages, and attend to the rinds. This kitchen is starting to smell deeply of crisping pig and newly fried chips. It smells of all the good, domestic things. Chris’s dad, who came to Britain from a village near Larnaca in Cyprus after the war, ran another cafe like this in Waterloo called the Victory. “I learned how to cook from watching him,” Chris says. Eventually he and Sue, who came to Britain in 1975, took it over but the one-bedroom flat up above was not big enough for their growing family. They heard that the building in Islington that houses the Hope was up for sale, bought it and took on the cafe, which came with a cook called George. “He’d been here for about 40 years,” Chris says. “He was in the kitchen and I was out front. He had teeth when he started and none when he finished.” Eventually George retired and Chris moved into the kitchen. The Hope might, at first glance, look like a museum piece: there’s the creamware-coloured frontage and the old-school carnival font for the signage, the half wood panelling and the six-seater wooden tables with their wrought iron legs, affixed to those walls from each side. There’s no Formica here. You would need to do precious little to shoot a 1940s period drama at the Hope. But it’s not a museum piece. It’s a working cafe, prized by locals not just for its bargain breakfasts, or the Greek dishes drawing on Sue and Chris’s Cypriot heritage, but for being a community hub, a third space outside the home. “I first came here when my kids were babies,” one of them will later tell me. “Now my children are in their 20s and they come here too.” But it’s also an endangered species. Thousands of these caffs have closed in recent years. Many were opened and run by first-generation immigrants like Chris’s dad, but the next generation didn’t always want to take them over, given the hours and the precarious economic reward. The Breakfast Club, the now 18-strong chain of hip, knowingly retro cafes may be able to charge £12 for the Greasy Spoon, its take on the full English, hot drink extra. Here at the Hope, the famed No 5 – it’s not a real greasy spoon unless the breakfasts are numbered – costs just £6.40 for egg, bacon, sausage, chips, a fried slice, beans or tomato and a cup of tea or coffee. Then there’s the literal and figurative appetite for this sort of high-calorie food. It’s engineered for a kind of manual labour that few are paid to do these days. When Chris first arrived, George used to fill the ovens with hunks of pork belly first thing to serve with cabbage to the Irish builders at lunchtime. “We don’t do that any more because the builders don’t come.” In a frothy food culture, where excitement builds over each new wave of innovation, over the arrival of live fire cooking, say, or fermentation cults, it’s easy to overlook the brilliant thing right in front of us. But one day it could be gone. And so, one chilly morning, I arrive at the Hope just before 7am in time to watch Sue and Chris, who drive in from Enfield, raise the metal shutters on another day of cooked breakfasts, Greek classics and tea. Lots and lots of tea. The main dining room is a long space, hung with sweet watercolours depicting Holloway Road through the ages. On the wall by the counter, now fronted by Covid-safe screens, are the blackboard menus. They used to have printed menus but that made putting prices up tricky. “And sometimes we have to,” says Chris. “Last year 20 litres of vegetable oil was £19. Now it’s £40.” The menus are dizzying. “Yeah, it’s a long menu and I’ve got a long brain,” says Chris. There are the six numbered breakfast options, including the veggie No 3 (swap out the eggs for bubble and squeak, to make it vegan). Down the middle of the blackboard, it says, “No alterations please!” though there are so many choices on the main blackboard that it’s not a problem: bacon and eggs for £3.60, two poached eggs on toast for £2.90, an extra fried slice for 50p. Then there are the lunches, starting with the most expensive dish here, the mixed grill at a heady £10.90. Or there’s the lamb chops, the lasagne or the shepherd’s pie, the omelettes, jacket potatoes, sandwiches many and various and, of course, the Greek dishes that Sue was taught by her aunt: the moussaka and the fasolaki and the stuffed courgettes, and so much more. “I used to cook those at home and bring them in,” Sue says. “Now I do them here.” I try the moussaka for my lunch, a soothing stratum of long cooked aubergine, minced lamb and bechamel, and a hefty follow-up to the cooked breakfast I’d had a few hours before. The No 5, since you asked. It would have been rude not to. When they started in the early 1990s there wasn’t much call for meat-free dishes. Then, says Sue, the requests for vegan food started. “I said to my son, who’s a trained chef, what can I do? He told me all the Greek things could easily be vegan.” So now there’s a list of those. She also has boxes of herbal teas. That’s relatively new too. One thing stays the same. It’s still cash only. “Some bloke said he was going to the cash machine to get money,” says Chris. “Never came back. Doesn’t matter. Sue never forgets a face. If he comes in again, she’ll charge him double.” To one side there’s a smaller back dining room. It will remain empty today but every year the environmental health team from nearby Islington council HQ start their Christmas festivities with lunch there. “We get on well with environmental health,” says Chris. They would have no complaints about the long galley-style kitchen this morning. It’s spotless. Every day at the Hope ends with the clean down, so every day at the Hope starts like this. There’s even a frying pan waiting on the gas hob, prefilled with a few centimetres of oil for the fried eggs, which are less fried than poached. Only the ones for sandwiches go on the flat top, the yolks broken with a flick of the just emptied shell, so they don’t dribble too much. Next to that is the bain-marie with cylindrical slots for the pots of peas, carrots, gravy and baked beans. Then come the two flat tops and, next to that, the deep-fat fryers. Out front, Sue butters bread for sandwiches and puts together the salads for lunch dishes. She calls the order and shoves the plate on to the counter just inside the kitchen for Chris to finish. “We don’t write anything down,” Chris says. “Just keep it all in our heads. She’ll shout a number for a breakfast and that’s all I need.” Sometimes she doesn’t even need to shout. “I see a regular come in and I know what they’re having.” Is it satisfying work? “It’s nice to see the plates come back empty,” he says. In the afternoon their grandson comes in to lend a hand, but most of the time it really is just the two of them, parrying an endless call and response of orders, in a mixture of English and Greek. In the first few hours of the day, the orders are predictable, and Chris is ready for them. Behind him are plastic boxes, filled with pre-sliced mushrooms, mash ready-mixed with cabbage for bubble and squeak and sausages that have been half pre-cooked and chilled, plus the hand-cut chips. “We do use frozen chips,” he says. “Bags of them. That’s what goes on the breakfasts. But I also do the hand-cut.” Out front Sam is having breakfast with his mate, Corbin. They’re lads in their 20s from northern towns, one a designer, one an artist. They meet here every couple of weeks. “It’s honest,” says Sam, when asked why he comes. “In London it’s hard to find somewhere that sticks to its values.” Corbin agrees. “Sue always looks after us really sweetly. It’s kind of like being back home. A lot of London cafes feel like a parody of a cafe. This is just itself.” They always have the same thing. “Vegetarian set number 3 for me,” says Sam. “No alterations.” Ian is in the meat trade and comes three or four times a week, has done for three years now. Poached eggs, bacon and toast if it’s breakfast; liver and bacon if its lunch. “It’s great to sit and observe,” he says. “You get so many different sorts of people.” He’s not wrong. There’s Armajit, a solicitor fresh from a case in the nearby magistrates court, here for the first time because he was taken by the cafe’s name. He’s a Jain and doesn’t eat meat. “If that name means anything they’ll be able to accommodate me.” Indeed they will. There’s Hank, a retired social worker, who has come here twice a week for six years and Mercé, originally from Catalonia, who says she recognises in this very British caff so much of the venerable cafes of Spain. It’s the kind of place where many of the customers clean up their own used mugs and plates, depositing them in the plastic box at the back to save Sue the trouble. In the depths of the pandemic, when the business was at risk, those same regulars made donations and ordered takeaways to help them get by. As breakfast edges into lunch Tony arrives. He used to be a postman. “A very bad one. I was a one-man union.” He’s been coming for 20 years, often in a foursome with his wife, Kathy, and another couple. But Kathy died last year and now he comes on his own, for the stuffed courgettes or, as today, the chilli with rice, but also for the memories of their life together. “It was Kathy’s favourite place to eat,” Tony says, quietly. “And they’re really nice people, Sue and Chris.” Sue returns the compliment. “I love my customers,” she says. “They’re like my family.” She has a small framed photograph of Kathy, perched on a shelf back behind the counter. Tony’s loss was theirs too. Not that they can always know every customer. “You should be here on match day,” Chris says. “It’s mad then.” The Arsenal ground is only a short walk away and the Hope is where many people start. So I pop back one Saturday, when Arsenal are playing Brighton. From noon onwards the queue is stacking up towards the door and out on to the street like a losing game of Tetris, and both dining rooms are full. Chris is no longer cooking to order. He just keeps a constant stream of breakfast ingredients going with the help of his son, also called Chris. And now he’s writing things down. “I have to,” he says. “No other way.” He lists what they get through on a match day: 300 eggs and 10kg of bacon, five 2.6kg catering tins of baked beans and 40kg of chips. There’s a pot washer in today, plus another pair of hands out front. Back at the Hope on that normal week day, it’s quieter now, as the lunch trade slips down a gear. Business has suffered since the pandemic. “Before Covid it was always busy, all the time,” says Sue. “Now, you just don’t know.” She also admits that, at 65, she has had enough. “She wants to stop,” Chris says. “This job does your hands in and your knees. So, we’re up for sale. But what would I do if I retired? I don’t have hobbies.” Not keen on golf then? He laughs. “I’m Greek. We gamble.” Plus, there’s the knotty business of finding a buyer for the Hope. What will it become then? Closing time is 5pm but from around 3.30pm he is cleaning down. (On a normal day they’d also be prepping food but they did double yesterday, because they knew I was coming.) The floor is cleaned, the flat top scoured, the stove polished. Tucked away in a corner is a supermarket trolley, which Chris uses for taking out the rubbish, one in a series he has used for the job. He found the first one out by the lamp-post on the curb. “There’s often a supermarket trolley out there,” he says, nodding towards the Holloway Road. The neighbourhood provides. Around 4.30pm Sue is sweeping the dining room floor when a customer turns up wanting breakfast. Does Chris ever get exasperated when people arrive so close to closing? “Course not. I’m not here for fun. I’m here to make money.” But soon they’ll have cleared their plate, like all the others who have eaten here today. The gas will be turned off. The master switch for the kitchen electrics will be flicked. The shutters will come down. It will be the end of another day at the Hope Workers Cafe.

Some is sublime, worth booking ahead for and travelling miles to get to; some is the reheated or deep-fried contents of various freezer bags and flung at plates. My job – and it is a real job – is to decipher what goes in which category. Take the Victoria at Oxshott in Surrey, for example: newly refurbished and reopened, and with Fat Duck alumni at the helm, which feels instinctively like the sort of place you should force your partner to change into trousers for. Charles and I frequently lock horns whenever we set off somewhere like this, which claims to be a pub but in fact serves “pan-fried” stone bass with keta caviar and smoked confit duck with pistachio. “But it’s a pub,” he’ll say, casting a hand over his designer track pants. “No,” I’ll reply. “They do wagyu bavette and rib-eye with bordelaise sauce. It’s trousers, proper trousers.” And off he’ll trudge back to the wardrobe in the manner of a man forced to complete the London marathon in a 140lb vintage deep-sea diving suit. That isn’t to say the Victoria specifies any sort of official dress code; rather that some places just exude a certain level of genteel correctness. The dining room is rather dreamily staged, like an olde English inn with the light blueprint of a pricy West End brasserie, all cosily furnished, with burgundy panelling, low beams and an open fire. Chef director Matt Larcombe was once head chef at The Crown at Bray, and met manager Simon King when both worked for Heston Blumenthal. There’s a bar area for locals and an extensive regular wine list that starts with house white, a grenache blanc, at £25, as well as a “rare wine menu” from which, if you’re really making a night of it, you can blow £9,750 on a bottle of 1997 Screaming Eagle cabernet sauvignon from the Napa Valley. See? I told you it’s a proper trousers type of place. I’ve knocked booze on the head for the time being, leading to a life of shrubs, kombuchas and seltzers, so they made me a “Light and Firey” with Lyre’s alcohol-free cane spirit and ginger (think dark’n’stormy, but without the morning-after clouds). We sat close to the blazing log fire as two thickly beer-battered oysters were brought to our table, perched back in their shells along with a puddle of pale green, seaweed-infused mayonnaise. If you’re someone who thinks they can’t face oysters, deep-frying the slimy blighters really does help, I assure you. Beautifully presented pickled cucumbers arrive with a mildly seasoned homemade gentleman’s relish, after which we share a plate of sweet, almost al dente salt-baked beetroot that’s even prettier than the cucumbers. Food doesn’t need to be a beauty contest, but it takes real skill to take a dowdy beetroot, then peel it, smoke it, pickle it, salt-bake it, top it with curd and scatter it with hazelnuts, and end up with something that wouldn’t look out of place on an afternoon tea cake-stand at the Ritz. There’s a fish and chips main course option at £19, as well as that Trenchmore Farm bavette at the same price, feasibly to stop the locals from rioting, but then prices hurtle upwards rather dramatically, and at a rate that might leave anyone picking up the family’s dinner bill in need of a lie-down in a darkened room afterwards. Beef wellington wrapped in light, crisp-yet-moist puff pastry with a rich, herby duxelles inner casing, for instance, came at a memorable £45 a slice. Chips, of the triple-cooked, stubby genre, were a fiver on top. Now, it must be said that this was almost certainly the finest beef wellington I will eat in this lifetime, filled with a chunk of rare beef similar in texture to chocolate truffle, but it’s rare that I leave a restaurant wondering if we should perhaps have saved a few pennies by going for the whole turbot with red wine and kale to share at £85. I know all too well, however, that restaurants – sorry, I of course mean pubs – such as this are astonishingly expensive to keep afloat. At least four different smart, cheery front-of-house staff served our table, and the desserts are made by the sort of imaginative patisserie wizard who takes the concept of the Snickers bar and reimagines it as a large square of soft, sweet, nutty mousse with chunks of aerated chocolate and an oozing, caramel centre. This is a very, very good pudding, and I doubt I’ll eat many finer things this year. We also tried a banoffee pie at £9, too, but it paled into insignificance in comparison. The Victoria at Oxshott is a very decent, semi-formal destination restaurant hiding in plain sight inside a village pub near Leatherhead. I’m certain the £40 Sunday lunch here would be an outstanding experience, particularly for a special occasion. No jacket required, but if you ask me … well, I’m still insisting on trousers. • The Victoria High Street, Oxshott, Surrey, 01372 238308.

The entire month lends itself to hunkering down and clawing back, with venues closed for weeks on end and others offering the slenderest of hours, sometimes with the radiators off to save on bills. In fact, it often feels like the opposite of hospitality. I’ve sat in many a dead and draughty dining room in January feeling like the only person in Britain who isn’t having a can of Campbell’s soup on the sofa that evening. So it was a welcome sight to reach Carmel, hiding away on a side road close to the tube station, to find the place so damned welcoming and vibrant. It was a freezing cold Wednesday, but the place was busy with folk keen to try this new North African/East Mediterranean opening from the folk behind east London’s Berber &amp; Q. Any customers eager to try anything in the current climate are a joyous sight, and Carmel exudes a sort of low-watt, twinkly joy, with candlelit tables, low-key music and delightful staff. When Berber &amp; Q opened in 2015, I was an instant fan, largely because it felt like a Middle Eastern grill house that had mated with an Ottolenghi cookbook and taken root in an Ibizan beach bar. Berber &amp; Q was loud, very delicious, rather dark, completely unbookable and resided in a former minicab office that had had what felt like only a minor refurbishment. You’d eat the likes of smoked short-rib with date glaze or cauliflower shawarma with beets and whipped feta, and it was very much a case of dig in, get messy and throw everything you were wearing in for a boil wash when you got home. If all of that sounds a bit hectic, you’re in luck, because Carmel is its much more grown-up relative. Or, more accurately, it’s as if someone shook Berber &amp; Q by the lapels, said, “It’s time to have a word with yourself, sonny”, and then gave it a side parting. There’s no loud, pulsating house music at Carmel, although the bathroom does have one of those weird aural soundscapes that made my dining companion Hugh wonder whether it was music or a broken air-conditioner unit; or maybe we’ve just both grown older. Carmel’s dinner menu is lush, laboured over and decidedly finickety. A bowl of silky, high-class hummus, for example, is made grander with a rich, lamb ragu topping garnished with pistachio and curry leaf, while a top-quality cured sardine appears prettily arranged on a bed of ratte potato, piped soured cream and doused in lemon verjus. Both are delicious and clearly painstakingly road-tested, even if they barely scrape the surface of our appetites. We share some charred hispi cabbage – one whole quarter, to be exact – expertly crisped and caramelised, served on a bed of labneh and made irresistible with macadamia dukkah. A bowl of gnocchi is spookily cloud-like, and a million miles from the starchy bullets I make at home. Carmel’s gnocchi come in a vibrant, spring sunlight-coloured turmeric yoghurt sauce with spinach and mizithra cheese; the dish is perhaps a little too delicately seasoned, but the tenderness of those gnocchi lives on in my mind. Three fearsomely large prawns, their shells caked in harissa, arrive in a pan of ’nduja butter with courgette tzatziki, and are beautifully flavoured, albeit a terrific, messy job to deal with. With almost everything at Carmel, the real flavours are in the smears, yoghurts and dressings, with not a whole lot of carbs on hand to bulk out the dishes. Thankfully, though, there are warm, fresh sourdough flatbreads with toppings such as spiced lamb with aleppo chilli or, in our case, tarama with soft sliced potato and rosemary to provide a little heft for hungry diners. Large plates for sharing begin at £25 for the slow-grilled urfa chicken, which turns up on a perilously sweet-bitter pomegranate molasses-soaked piece of sourdough, with some curry-pickled radicchio on the side. The two of us demolish it easily. Other sharing plates include smoked lamb neck shawarma with a shio koji marinade and seared cod with palourde clams. A pudding of dark chocolate tart with tahini cream has a brittle, teeth-shatteringly sweet biscuit bottom, but it’s ridiculously lovely. In being all elegant and adult, Carmel may have lost something of the largesse of its east-London relative, but in cooking ingenuity, it leaves Berber &amp; Q way behind. Carmel is dainty, delightful, good for both a date night and a cold midweek in early 2022, and it’s absolutely heaving. A most promising start to the eating-out year. • Carmel 23-25 Lonsdale Road, London NW6, 020-3848 2090. Open Tues-Sun, noon-11pm (10pm Sun).

Things did not go to plan’ – restaurant review | Grace Dent on restaurants','I love a thoughtful pub renovation; it’s one of my favourite things. Anyone can shove a skip outside a pub, then tear out its heart and history in a bid to make things modern. And no one thanks breweries and landlords afterwards for creating sterile spaces that play endless Sky Sports. Then you have places such as the Cove at Fairlight, near Hastings, which closed in 2014 and sat about looking sad until Olivia Loveridge and Henry David took it on this spring and gave it new life. The wood-fronted pub is painted black, giving it the air of one of the 50 or so 16th-century net huts along the shingle beach in Hastings Old Town. The pub sign is an ethereal, hand-painted image of midnight swimmers letting it all hang out on the naturist beach just up coast. Disappointingly, no naturists were spotted during my time at the Cove; the clientele in the beer garden had all chosen to wear pants and shoes to enjoy their pints of Harvey’s Sussex Best and plates of bitterballen, an addictive, croquette-like Dutch bar snack, usually made with meat but here with mustardy cauliflower. The Cove’s menu is small and ever-changing, but it comes with a claim of local provenance that I found quite irresistible. “Venison is hunted by Arthur in his woods,” it reads. “Other meat is supplied by Jamie down the road. Fish is from the Channel; salad, greens, and whatever else is in season is grown 400 yards away. The dairy is in Northiam, and the egg layers all have names.” Adorable, yes, but more important than any of those things – the signage, the garden, the menu – is the fact that there’s a large print of the actor Nicolas Cage in the loo. It’s a moody, black-and-white shot of the Con Air star in a snakeskin jacket enjoying some quiet time with a small dog. Let’s hope he pops by some time soon for a plate of bitterballen and a traipse about the naturist cove. We stopped by late on a Sunday afternoon for a sort of tea-stroke-dinner, having already had lunch elsewhere, and were planning only to graze on a few small plates. Things did not go to plan. The Cove makes fresh Scotch pancakes to go with its smoked salmon starter, and another starter of parmesan custard comes with anchovy toast. I adore Scotch pancakes, which are the more rib-sticking, sweeter cousin of the dainty, flimsy blini. We call them drop scones in Carlisle, and slather them with butter. Here at the Cove, they are warm and gloriously spongy, and come with the aforementioned smoked salmon, pickled cucumbers and light, whipped horseradish cream. The parmesan custard, meanwhile, was a pungent little number, set in a little bowl like a creme brulee, and was served with equally assertive, fish-butter-smeared toast. You see, the Cove doesn’t serve straightforward pub food – it is grown-up and clever – but neither does it alienate family groups with the sort of cheffy whimsy that leaves your gran staring sadly at a plate of calf’s cheek in elderflower sap. The Sunday menu features a prawn cocktail made with brown shrimp and a house burger on brioche with crisp onions and the chips included. Such gestures go a long way when you’re trying to build good will in a community. The roast that day was a large portion of moist, rolled porchetta with an earthy, herby stuffing. It was served with fluffy Yorkshire puddings, roast carrots and some of the best roast potatoes I’ve ever eaten, and which came with a gorgeous, fresh, green dipping salsa. Yes, Yorkshire puds and salsa for Sunday dinner. Rulebook ripped up. It was a mountain of food and of a fabulous quality, especially considering we ate at nearly 4pm, when most pubs are usually beginning to struggle. Those wanting something lighter should go for the shakshuka, a humble baked egg in tomatoes and peppers that really pack some heat. Another main of sea bass was made memorable by its warm accompanying salad of peas, beans and asparagus. Dessert, although wildly unnecessary by this point, was a thing of simple beauty: a bowl of dark chocolate ganache – no buttery base, no shell, just ganache – with hazelnut praline on a puddle of creme fraiche. It left our table of three hushed and wildly territorial. Our order of “one pudding and three spoons” had felt correct when we’d made it, then this ganache arrived – airy, moreish, wickedly rich and proving why simple, French-influenced, home-style cooking will live on for ever. The Cove is just a recently reopened pub with a paint job and a new menu near a beach in East Sussex, and it’s trying to make the locals happy.

Starters £8-£16, mains £17-£27, desserts £5-£9, wines from £28 The Alice B Toklas Cook Book, first published in 1954, includes among its many recipes the instructions for making a hashish fudge. The confectionary, Toklas says, is easy to prepare, but she warns that it may encourage hysterical laughter and grandiose thoughts “on many simultaneous planes”. When the London restaurant that carries her name first opened late last year, the owners, who are also the founders of Frieze magazine and art fairs, said they were very much inspired by Toklas, writer and partner of Gertrude Stein. Together, Stein and Toklas staged many intricate dinner parties in Paris attended by some of the greatest artists of the early 20th century. However, the restaurant’s owners said, the new venture would not be using any of the recipes from the book. So that’s no hashish fudge then. No worries. Because instead, Toklas has their chips, which are more than capable of inspiring an awful lot of grandiose thoughts on many planes at once. Such as: “Blimey they’re good” and “Why are they so good?” and “How do they make them so good?” Halfway through the main course, shortly before ordering that second portion, I bowled up to the semi-open kitchen and badgered the chefs mid-service for answers. I’m sure they were thrilled to see me. It turns out they use a version of Heston Blumenthal’s triple-cook method. The potatoes are cut into thin chips (as against the chunky shape favoured by Blumenthal), then steamed for 20 minutes (rather than boiled). They are chilled, fried at 140C, chilled again, then finished at a higher heat. The result really is the Platonic ideal of the chip: golden, creviced, soft inside, but crunchy. Oh so crunchy. And salty. And unlike some, they never seem to murder appetite. They cost £5 for a heaped bowlful. I challenge you upon eating them, to begrudge that price. “Serves fabulous chips” risks sounding like the proverbial damning with faint praise. It is nothing of the sort. Given its art world origins, you would be forgiven for fearing that Toklas might be some conceptual reimagining of the very notion of the restaurant. True, it does manage to be achingly cool. It is tucked away down a quiet sidestreet running down to the north embankment of the Thames, by Waterloo Bridge, and occupies a brutalist building that apparently was once a car park. Witness the use of carefully moulded concrete. It could be a sibling to the National Theatre. I say that admiringly. Now it is a broad utilitarian space of parquet flooring, with flourishes of modern art, alongside curving banquettes in shades of teal. It has about it the air of a well-heeled modernist canteen. The menu, however, is simply a set of great ingredients, presented to the very best of their advantage, much like those chips. No wheels are reinvented. No envelopes are pushed. There is no concept at all, beyond, “Do you fancy something to eat?” You are just fed very well. I went twice. The first time was a quick lunch with a friend: asparagus, roast chicken, some of those chips, pistachio ice-cream and lemon sorbet. As I was leaving, the manager pulled me aside and told me that their new head chef had only started that day. Could I bear that in mind if I was planning to write something? I told him he needn’t have said a word. I wouldn’t have noticed. For the record that new head chef is Yohei Furuhashi, who has time at the River Café and Petersham Nurseries on his CV. This fits with the virtuous simplicity of the food. I returned a few days later, this time for dinner. I even booked under a pseudonym and everything. They didn’t seem surprised to see me again. We had generous ribbons of cured trout, the colour of orange sherbet, interleaved with thin slices of pickled cucumber, dotted with capers and dressed with an olive oil so pungent it was almost nose-tickling. There was more asparagus, served warm with a wedge of butter mixed up with the salty hit of grated bottarga. Toklas also has a very fine bakery in the same building, from which came their densely crusted sourdough, so that none of that bottarga butter went to waste. Pieces of grilled chicken were served off the bone, with the sort of crisp, dark and dense skin that suggests a bird that had a bit of a life before ending up here. With it came a mess of chickpeas, roasted fennel and a dollop of salsa rossa, that butch condiment of puréed sundried tomatoes and bell peppers. A perfectly grilled tranche of brill came with verdant tangles of monk’s beard and fat cherry tomatoes roasted until bursting from their skins. With this, as I might have said, we had a bowl of their chips. Or two. Nerdily, we discussed which individual chip was our favourite. I put forward the view that a perfect bowl needed to be a combination of the long robust fat ones and the small broken ones, and those that are merely crisp-like shards. It may have been around this point that, reasonably lubricated by a few glasses of a Fattoria San Lorenzo from the Italian Marches, I decided that interrogating the kitchen on their chip method was a good idea. I thank them for their forbearance. While standing at the pass, I also learned that this is a kitchen with a fine collection of cookbooks on a high shelf. I find that reassuring in any kitchen. The first time, we finished our lunch with those ices: the soft, creamy tones of pistachio; the eye-widening zip and flare of lemon. The second time, it was a dark mousse-like chocolate cake the colour of night, with crème fraîche, and a deep-filled almond tart, with a syrupy mess of kumquats. Then have mint tea served in exquisitely refined Japanese ceramics. It would be great if I could now say that eating here is cheap as chips, but as those fabulous chips aren’t exactly cheap, we know the rest of it isn’t going to be either. Still, it’s not extortionate and it is very good. Plus, unlike Alice’s fudge, it’s entirely legal. News bites The 16-strong Tonkotsu group of ramen restaurants, which has outposts in London, Brighton and Birmingham, is celebrating its 10th birthday. As part of the celebrations, it has partnered with John Chantarasak of AngloThai to offer a Thai Curry Tonkotsu. The dish, available at all venues from 8 to 30 June, features their famed 18-hour pork broth, enriched with lardo and spicy northern Thai curry paste. It’s topped with thin-cut homemade noodles, braised pork belly, pickled mustard greens, spring onion, coriander, a lime wedge, a seasoned egg and crispy fried noodles (tonkotsu.co.uk). Scottish chef Tony Singh is taking his street food operation Radge Chaat into the Bonnie &amp; Wilde food hall on the fourth floor of the St James Quarter development in Edinburgh. Radge Chaat, which he first launched with his brother Lucky last year, features an entirely vegan and vegetarian menu of Indian street food dishes, including samosa chaat, pakora chaat and a vegan take on chicken tikka (tonysingh.co.uk). Natural wine enthusiast Natalia Ribbe and chef Jackson Berg, who operate Barletta inside Margate’s Turner Contemporary gallery, are launching a new venture in the town’s Cliftonville area. The small wine bar will have 20 seats inside and 20 outside and will, they say, be inspired by the wine bars of Paris and the French south coast. The wine bar will open in July, followed by the restaurant in October (barletta.co.uk).

Snacks and small plates £3-£6.50, steaks and chops £16-£28, desserts £7, wines from £25 First impressions matter. First impressions can also be wrong. The first impression tonight at the Alan, a new boutique hotel on the edge of Manchester’s Chinatown, is of somewhere about as popular as herpes. The moodily lit foyer is a confection of raw brick and rough plastered walls, housing stone slab tables of the sort Aslan might be sacrificed upon if you were in need of a little light midcourse religious symbolism. There’s ceiling ducting and spindly industrial lighting and acres of polished crazy paving-style stone floor. And almost no punters. The Alan isn’t just quiet. It feels abandoned. A single employee is on duty in the main foyer this evening, eyeing the entrance. He greets us cheerfully as we push through the doors. Perhaps he’s grateful for the company. To the right is the dining area. There’s a square, open kitchen, edged by a low counter. It houses three earnest-looking cooks. You can watch them at work while you eat, but tonight nobody is doing so. They are cooking for just a couple of tables. Granted, it’s a Tuesday night, but currently there aren’t that many options in Manchester on a Tuesday night. I should know. I’m in town for a turn in Dictionary Corner on Countdown, constantly hoping to find an esoteric word from the nine available letters to make me look clever. (Esoteric would be a great eight-letter find.) It’s an opportunity to review, so I’ve scoped out the options, but perhaps because of ever-present staff shortages the available candidates, both obvious and less so, are not open on a Monday and Tuesday. But hey, there’s the Alan, which is new. And empty. Something must be up. Alternatively, it’s just a quiet school night. Let’s go with that, with a side order of “they don’t know what they’re missing”. Because right now the kitchen of the Alan, led by chef Iain Thomas, is cooking a truly delightful and admirably tight menu of diverting dishes, which reveal their joys a little at a time. And all at a price positioned to comfort rather than terrorise (nine letters, but you’re unlikely to get three “r”s). Money has clearly been spent on this development, which is apparently designed to celebrate and revive the existing materials in this once industrial building. If so, they’re not attempting to recoup that investment from the parade of small plates on offer. They top out at £6.50; the steaks and chops, sourced from the highly regarded Butcher’s Quarter in the north of the city, are a bargain, too. We begin, for £3.50, with a tidily arranged pile of vinegared anchovies (nine letters), their silvery skins glinting up at us, zhuzhed (great seven-letter Countdown word, if you had two zeds) with Amalfi lemon, decorated with fronds of green herbs and resting in a puddle of peppery olive oil. We get a plate of blistered flatbreads and politely introduce one to the other. Pearly cubes of halibut ceviche, tasting both of citrus and surf, come with burnt orange and the lightly bitter joys of chicory. Hispi cabbage has been broken up into its individual leaves and then heaped with friable pieces of long-braised lamb shoulder. Celeriac has first been salt-baked unto a buttery softness (eight letters). It comes with a soothing celeriac purée, and a crunchy, truffled crumb. My only grumble is with their take on imam bayildi. Halved and roasted baby aubergines are laid on a tomato and garlic purée, with lots more of the by now familiar green herbs. The purée is nice enough, but the aubergine is just a little dry and tough. Perhaps head for the baba ganoush from the snacks menu, if aubergine action is what you’re after. From the Butcher’s Quarter menu, we share a perfectly cooked pork chop, pre-sliced to reveal the pink and to help avoid steak knives at dawn. It’s a steal at £16, and beautifully presented in the shape of a fan of the sort a Victorian lady might have favoured, had fans made of quality grilled pig been her thing. We have a side of their chard brassicas (terrific nine-letter word) showered with grated lemon zest to make us feel good about ourselves, and a bowl of their chips, because we deserve them on account of the brassicas. Life is all about balance isn’t it? Talking of sprouts (kind of) we have a lovely chat to our eager waiter, partly to stop him asking how everything is, less because he’s been trained to do so, but because he seems genuinely interested. He’s studying music business at university in the city and also has a band influenced by 80s greats “like Prefab Sprout”. I both admire his taste and feel very, very old. Come for the small plates; stay for dessert, because the short list includes an Arctic roll. Great, isn’t it? I’m a seemingly sophisticated, urbane 55-year-old man. Across the years I have gone into full culinary swoon mode over the finest of Parisian chocolate work or recreations of bird’s cages in golden spun sugar enclosing a wild strawberry millefeuille. It turns out that all I really wanted was a seriously well-made Arctic roll with a scoop of blackberry ice-cream, to remind me gently of what it was to once have been an easily pleased seven-year-old. It has been left out of the fridge long enough so that the sponge has softened, and the edges of the vanilla ice-cream filling have just begun to melt. If that wasn’t enough, now they bring what they call a Snickers (eight letters, but I don’t think names are allowed): a broad cylinder of an airy milk chocolate mousse with, at its centre, a generous dollop of dulce de leche, alongside candied peanuts and topped by a scoop of ice-cream. These are proper desserts that have required care, consideration and a childlike glee. They cost £7 each. The wine list is short, just five whites and reds, but at least they are all available by the glass. A couple of other tables have come and gone during the evening but it really has remained quiet. However, there is now a solo diner at the counter, being entertained by the brigade who seem grateful for the company. The Alan is a hotel restaurant with which you can be on first-name terms. Right now though, it needs a few more pals. Not least because what is going on here is thoroughly alluring. And that’s a solid eight-letter word. My work here is done. News bites Four big-name chefs are coming together on 10 May to cook a dinner raising funds for the #cookforukraine appeal. Tickets for the four-course dinner at Pino, on London’s Kensington High Street, cost £85. The menu includes steak tartare with an asparagus and pecorino salad by Henry Harris of the much-missed Racine, nettle and borage ravioli by Allegra McEvedy of Albertine, a casserole of brill and morels by Rick Stein, and a ginger tart with rhubarb by Rowley Leigh. For tickets, visit pinobar.co.uk. The Owl gastropub, which first opened in Kirkgate Market, Leeds, in 2019, is relocating. It will reopen on 28 May on a site that’s twice the size of the original within the Mustard Wharf residential development, by the River Aire to the east of the city centre. The last service at the current location will be on 21 May (theowlleeds.co.uk). Margot Henderson of Rochelle Canteen is going into the pub business. She has taken over the Three Horseshoes in the Somerset village of Batcombe and will reopen it as a food pub with five bedrooms in November. Expect a menu of devilled crab and focaccia, chicken and tarragon pie, grilled brill, fennel, chard and green sauce with a Somerset apple crumble, custard tarts and local cheeses with cobnuts to finish.

Starters £6.95-£12.95, mains £8.95-£19.95, desserts £6.75-£7.95, wines from £24 The day after I had dinner at Richoux, I went on Google Street View in an attempt to answer a simple question: what was it specifically about the place that had made me stride past for so many years, my nose in the air, convinced it was unworthy of my attention? I found it in an image from August 2014. There was a sandwich board outside on the pavement of London’s Piccadilly offering “Any breakfast with a hot drink and juice for £9.95”. It was illustrated by a grimly anaemic, grossly unappetising photo of eggs Benedict. Under its dollop of pale, industrial-looking hollandaise, it presented as something you might wish to treat with a broad-spectrum antibiotic, rather than eat. It all looked rather desperate and needy. London is full of places we might choose to walk past on instinct: “Scottish” steak houses offering sides straight from the deep freeze, Chinese buffets where the Day-Glo orange food festers under heat lamps, branches of Pizza Hut where they’ll flog you a pie with a crust stuffed with cysts of cheese burger. They always seem full. I’ve often wanted to run in and bawl at the punters to save themselves; to tell them they could do so much better. But that would be the act of a spittle-flecked, raging madman and anyway, if they couldn’t be bothered to do some basic research, what business was it of mine? The fact is I’d always had Richoux in that category. I didn’t know what it was for. Perhaps that was grossly unfair. After all, I had never even stepped inside. Over the years the brand had expanded. There were other Richoux branches in Knightsbridge, St John’s Wood, Mayfair and even Port Solent, but the pandemic did for them. In January 2021, the parent company was put into administration and all of them closed. The Richoux name, and the premises on Piccadilly, was bought by Naveen Handa, part of the family behind the Cairn Group of hotels and restaurants. What he’s done with it is glorious. He’s created an extremely good-value, stylish brasserie deserving of its prime location on one of the capital’s grandest streets. He has installed two chefs, Jamie Butler and Lewis Spencer, both from the much-garlanded Moor Hall in Lancashire. They, in turn, have put that cutting-edge kitchen experience to one side and instead written a pitch-perfect menu of beautifully executed crowd-pleasers. After trading for 113 years, Richoux has become an instant classic. Although I never ate there, I glanced inside a few times over the years, and it always seemed rather dark and dour with lots of heavy wood and sombre colours. It’s not like that any more. The smart alcoves down each side of the room have been retained along with the brass light fittings, but the whole thing has been lightened: peach walls, pale blue banquettes, a new tiled floor in a scallop shell design. They’ve kept the dessert cabinet just inside the door, and filled it with Butler’s snowy meringue-encased gateaux and jam and cream-topped cruffins, a cross between a croissant and muffin. The closest thing to innovation here is a plate of raw tuna and watermelon, cut into identically sized pink and purple cubes, then given a squeeze of lime, peppery olive oil and a little mint. Otherwise, it’s a menu of old friends; of dishes you could imagine happily eating on any day of the week and quite possibly at any time. Have the French onion soup for £6.95, topped by a garlic crouton laden with toasted gruyère, or a Caesar salad for the same price. There’s beef carpaccio, or creamy burrata with the pertest of tomatoes. A jumbo prawn cocktail is all the good things, assembled with care. There’s a little blitzed and seasoned avocado at the bottom, then crisp leaves of baby gem lettuce, topped with squeakily fresh prawns under just the right amount of Marie Rose sauce and finished with a dusting of smoked paprika. And for a main? There’s a grilled fillet of sea bream with salsa verde, or a crisp-skinned, thick-cut fillet of salmon on a black rice salad, with a little pickled cucumber and artichoke, both at £15.95. Feeling flush? The ribeye is £19.95, but for a fiver less there’s also a flat iron. They tell me they’ve just run out of that, but can substitute with bavette, one of those steak cuts which trades tenderness for flavour. Bring all your own teeth. It is perfectly cooked and comes with a rocket and parmesan salad, a shiny metal beaker of good chips and an unimprovable béarnaise. Or just stop here for a chicken club sandwich or a croque monsieur or smoked salmon with scrambled eggs. One of those, and a glass of wine, and you’ll barely break £15. I love the diversity and vivacity of the London restaurant scene, really I do. But sometimes reading those menus full of innovation and thrills and umami and tahini and charred hispi can be utterly exhausting. Sometimes I just want to be brought something nice to eat. The menu at Richoux is the promise of nice things to eat, executed in an elegant, dark blue sans serif font. Until now Brasserie Zedel just up the road at Piccadilly Circus had had this territory pretty much to itself. They’ve now got serious competition. My companion for dinner was late. To be fair he is always late, which is odd because he’s a gifted jazz musician with extraordinary timing. Tonight, he was so late that we had to forgo dessert or we’d miss the gig we were attending. Hence, I came back a couple of days later and raided the dessert counter, because it is my job to do so. I took home the good stuff. The star is the individual apple tarte tatin, with crisp caramelised pastry and sweet, toffeed fruit. It’s £4.95 to take away or £7.95 to eat in where it comes with ice-cream or crème anglaise. Or perhaps a wedge of that gateau with its layers of light sponge and mascarpone cream, finished with soft Swiss meringue, its surface blowtorched to a caramel brown. Do not miss the sugar-crusted, jam-filled wonder that is the cruffin. Oh, just have it all. Regularly, I am asked to recommend somewhere “nice” to eat in central London, by which I assume they mean somewhere classy and civilised and unchallenging and not ruinously expensive. Richoux is my new best answer. News bites The venerable Castle Hotel in Taunton, which has been owned and run by the Chapman family for three generations, has appointed a new head chef, who happens to be an old one. Andrew Swann started at The Castle as a commis chef in 2000. He has since worked for Zafferano and L’Escargot in London, among others. ‘I fell in love with cooking when I first started my career here,’ he has said. ‘And to be able to come back so many years later to continue that journey is really special for me.’ The kitchens of the Castle have recently undergone a £150,000 renovation. See the-castle-hotel.com. Sandwich maestro Max Halley has teamed up with restaurant group Burger &amp; Lobster to create two limited edition lobster rolls which will be available until 6 June. The lobster cocktail roll costs £26 and features lobster, Marie Rose sauce and all the accessories. The fish and chip lobster roll, for the same price, brings in tartar sauce, a pea and mint purée and crushed salt and vinegar crisps. At burgerandlobster.com. The arrival this month of mandatory calorie counts on menus for restaurant operators with 250 staff or more was awaited with trepidation. Many restaurateurs complained that it would introduce great costs both for the calculations and menu reprinting. The solution to the latter lies in the approach by the nationwide Ivy Collection group. They’ve retained the non-calorie count menus, but are supplying a card with a QR code for both nutritional and allergen information.

Inside, the place is a modern, airy, Santa Monica-style seafood brasserie, with large, luxurious booths for group eating, tasteful jazz music and fuzzy, flattering lighting. Outside, the post-6pm-on-a-Saturday high street is lairy, with police vans lining up to begin battle with shoeless mobs of vomiting bottomless brunchers. Goddard &amp; Gibbs has dropped anchor at the new One Hundred Shoreditch hotel, formerly known as the Ace, which had a restaurant called Hoi Polloi. That rather cool, all-day diner was a pleasant enough spot, and you might have seen a minor celebrity or fashion designer barking through a power breakfast, but the food – twists on British and American classics – wasn’t anything to clap like a seal about. Then again, restaurants in hotels very rarely are. There are exceptions, but most rely heavily on the hotel’s guests being chivvied there for one night to eat mediocre food that at least looks passable with an Instagram filter on it. Cleverly, the name Goddard &amp; Gibbs doesn’t seem as if it would be anything like that at all. Rather, it sounds like some established firm of fishmongers that has put a handful of tables in front of its counter in order to serve the day’s best catch. So I booked a table absentmindedly, with one eye on the website and the other on administering the cat’s hyperthyroid medicine, firmly believing I was off for dinner at a tiny, independent restaurant down some Shoreditch back street. Obviously, it was nothing of the sort. “Inspired by the quaint fishing villages and busy seaside towns dotted along Britain’s coastline,” the restaurant website reads, as if the copywriting had been farmed out to an enthusiastic someone in Azerbaijan who had clearly never seen Cleethorpes or Bognor, or, for that matter, the enormo dining room in Shoreditch they were describing. Still, the website also promises a thoughtfully curated, almost all-pescatarian menu, and Goddard &amp; Gibbs definitely does seafood, beginning with Maldon oysters, raw Orkney scallops with elderflower, dressed crab and steamed mussels, before moving on to hake kiev, poached Cornish pollack and skate wing with XO butter. And that all seemed very encouraging – until the food began to arrive, when I started to suspect that here was a kitchen doing the very minimum it could to push out hundreds of covers a day, with few flourishes, scant innovation and often little flavour at all. Six oysters turned up on a silver stand with a red-wine shallot dressing – that is, exactly how we’ve been eating them in the UK for the past 50 years – followed by a plate of yuzu-cured chalk stream trout that wasn’t particularly zinging with freshness. Sea bream ceviche was marginally better, with a soy dressing and topped with slivers of scotch bonnet. A bowl of “ember-baked” potatoes with cod’s roe was served with such little attention to detail that I began to feel offended. It consisted of 10 unseasoned new potatoes that seemed more steamed than baked, and they came topped with a dot of low-grade taramasalata goo. Just up the road on Redchurch Street, Brat’s legendary smoked potatoes make me breathless; in comparison, Goddard &amp; Gibbs’ spuds were like a terrible covers band honking through my favourite hits. We ordered “the catch of the day”, which that evening was more sea bream, this time butterflied and overcooked by about five minutes. It lacked anything saucy, oily or buttery to help it along, apart from some shaved fennel and more thinly sliced scotch bonnet. On the side, and for a mere £5, we received about 100g of overcooked broccoli with a scattering of the non-expensive kind of flaked almonds. The overall mood of the experience puzzles me. Why open a gigantic seafood restaurant with little care or attention to the fine culinary art of fish cookery? The staff were charming, sometimes attentive and dealt stoically with the fact that those lovely, six-person booths are so deep, they can barely hand the food into them safely. By 8pm, the front of house were already struggling to cope and turning away crowds of hopeful walk-ins at the door. We had psyched ourselves up to see what their rendition of fried doughnut, malt ice-cream, miso caramel and peanut dust might be like, and we waited and waited, before eventually realising that our pudding order never reached the kitchen. Goddard &amp; Gibbs is a confused restaurant that’s perfect for people who are on holiday in Shoreditch, who may want to drink heavily and have a lovely time talking to friends, and who don’t really care if they don’t remember a whole lot about dinner. Next time, I’ll sail right past. Goddard &amp; Gibbs 100 Shoreditch High Street, London E1, 020-7613 9802. Open lunch, Tues-Sun, noon-3.30pm; dinner Tues-Sat, 5.30-11.30pm.

It is where Japanese cuisine meets Peruvian – think salmon tataki, but with aji amarillo tiger’s milk, or maybe a plate of ornate, yellowtail kingfish maki rolls dotted with yuzu truffle soy and romano pepper. It’s raw fish meets heat and spice, with simple, clean Japanese plates sent slightly haywire by Peruvian influences such as sweet potato, chancha corn or vinegary anticucho sauce. Delicious, right? The best known nikkei restaurant in London is the rather alarming Chotto Matte in Soho, which I have on my list of “absolutely abominable places that continue to thrive despite my hex”. In absolute fairness, I went only once, but, over the short period of time this multifloored hellscape took to whip £150 out of my purse, I concluded that it was not for me. Heavy on graffiti and flashing lights, the decor was described as “grunge”, but felt more like stage 1 of a migraine aura, while the service was so chaotic, I left convinced that the South American red titi monkeys at London zoo were handed their tea-time walnuts with more aplomb. I did, however, like the food. Nikkei is delicate, surprising and full of huge, bolshie flavours. The sushi is wildly overstyled, and never boring: it comes wrapped in breadcrumbs, or drizzled, Jackson Pollock-style, with yuzu soy, or festooned with mango puree and served on a leaf. And now a nikkei restaurant has opened in Leyton, east London, run by chef Denis Gobjila, ex of Chotto Matte, and his business partner, Victor Rosca, formerly of Sushisamba and Lucky Cat, both also vast, noisy, pricey restaurants whose clientele show up in sashes, get leathered on espresso martinis and eat tiny mouthfuls of miso cod. But Gobjila and Rosca have opened something small, quiet and about eight miles from anywhere even resembling high glamour. Bamboo Mat is on the way out of Leyton, and almost en route to Walthamstow. It is a sparse room, and there is nothing lovely about it, apart from the fact that Gobjila is an incredible chef serving excellent plates of Peruvian joy such as hamachi tiradito and anticucho chicken thigh, as well as noteworthy maki, nigiri and sashimi. It’s impossible not to want the place to succeed when he bounds out of the kitchen with a bowl of pale, meaty sea bass ceviche in a fruity, warm, sunset-coloured sweet potato, aji amarillo, ginger, garlic and coriander sauce with nutty, caramelised nuggets of chancha corn. His hamachi tiradito is prettily staged with slices of raw yellowtail kingfish arranged like a blossoming flower in a vibrant, yuzu truffle soy dressing and topped with a scattering of finely chopped chives. Ordering these dishes had been something of a battle, though, because our server seemed to have already decided what we should eat and, in his opinion, three dishes from the starters section wouldn’t leave room for the “signature” mains he was determined we’d have. Nevertheless, I wantonly ordered the lightly seared salmon tataki with aji amarillo tiger’s milk and the briefest slivers of red onion; the starters also featured oysters and tempura shrimp with some sort of hot dipping mayo, but I didn’t want to push my luck. Since leaving Bamboo Mat, I’ve tried to nail the essence of the anticucho sauce it serves with chicken, lamb chops and octopus and that clings particularly beautifully to seared, fatty, skin-on chicken thighs. Was that white-wine vinegar or sake? Yuzu, lemon juice, soy? No combinations I make at home come even close to touching it, which is, after all, the hallmark of good, simple, personal cooking. I can’t replicate it at home, so I’ll have to go back. Bamboo Mat’s maki, meanwhile, verge on the ostentatious, with the likes of “crispy Philadelphia maki” filled with fried shrimp and cream cheese being perhaps not to everyone’s taste, while the deep-fried crispy mozzarella and salmon maki slathered in both unagi and spiced egg sauces and a layer of crisp onions, are rather heavy-going but actually rather delicious. Even so, I preferred the relative calm of the spicy tuna maki, with their delicate slices of baby gem and the heat of shichimi pepper. We also picked and scoffed our way through hot maki filled with sea bass ceviche and covered in a nicely seasoned vegetable salsa, and elaborately plated, pond-green sea eel, spring onion and avocado rolls. There is one solitary pudding, a sort-of deconstructed raspberry cheesecake that, after all the heat, spark, pizzaz and deep-fried breadcrumbs, was in fact the perfect palate-soother. Bamboo Mat was deserted, but sedate when we visited, but it probably won’t be for long. It’s a smaller, cheaper and better Chotto Matte, without all the shouty people and art installations.

The menu was full of delicious-sounding things such as cullen skink, hot smoked mackerel, and Normandy chicken casserole with leeks and tarragon. As I loitered by the door, something about the cafe’s name rang a bell, then, to my glee, I realised this was the place whose owner famously doesn’t like Guardian readers, and who earlier this year penned a job advert banning them. Perhaps I should have been offended, but there was a bread-and-butter pudding made with crumpets on the menu, plus, to quote Groucho Marx, “I refuse to join any club that would have me as a member.” No chef truly wants to see a restaurant critic waddle into view the moment they begin service, dip a finger in the demi-glace to check its consistency and behave as if a cold plate is the nadir of suffering, so I found it rather refreshing that the chef/owner here had already set out his stall that he had no time for my ilk. This charming, long, narrow strip of a bistro has survived for more than 25 years without the likes of me, and is these days serving a sort of boho, rustic, French-Scottish, casual-elegant menu to a unending stream of walk-ins. Cafe 52 has no need for my pronouncements. One of the very lovely servers squeezed me in ever so politely as a table for one and left me listening to Since You’ve Been Gone by Rainbow while trying to choose between the marinated herring with soured cream and walnuts and the portobello mushrooms cooked in cider. Could this really be the same controversial cafe? I popped to the ladies to wash my hands and found it freshly painted, a spotless sink, delightful hand soap and a large framed photograph of Mother Teresa bearing the words “Always wash your minge”. Yes, this must be the place. I like Aberdeen a great deal, and spent three wonderful days there alone, talking to strangers and eating: at the vegan Cafe Bonobo, where the thinly sliced carrot “smoked salmon” bagels are delightful; at steakhouse Vovem Meat &amp; Liquor for pulled brisket mac ’n’ cheese; before heading farther afield to The Silver Darling on Pocra Quay for tempura oyster with wasabi. But Cafe 52 was my favourite. Proprietor Steve Bothwell might have little time for “liars” and “bullshitters”, as he says in that advert, but he has created a place where glorious food matters, and I can say beyond doubt that my restorative bowl of Normandy chicken casserole will be one of the greatest things I’ll eat all year. Chicken soup – or stew, in this case – does touch the soul, and a good one is as close to a cuddle from Mother T herself as you can get. This one featured five or six chunks of soft, stewed breast, thigh and leg in a clear tarragon broth with the very occasional chunk of soft potato or slice of garlicky mushroom, and was way more than the sum of its parts. This stew, topped with a vivid pink bundle of pickled red cabbage, was a wonder, with fragrant tarragon the hero ingredient. I ate it with a side of kale, deep fried and laced with chilli, which is the only way to treat it – that is, mercilessly, otherwise it’s really only good for hamster bedding. Bothwell’s octogenarian mother makes all the puddings at Cafe 52, and just two spoons into her crumpet bread-and-butter pudding I felt the need to check with the staff if anyone had written down the recipes for her carrot and brandied fruit cake or her coffee cake with rum syllabub. The bread pudding is a fearsome, rib-sticking challenge of a dessert, with crumpet after crumpet smothered in sweet, eggy custard and served with vanilla ice-cream. It’s the sort of dish that makes guests at other tables wink and wish me luck, as if I was some sort of amateur at this game. The first four or five spoons were sublime, all sticky and compelling; I was living my best life. After that, however, the going got tough. It felt ungracious to loosen my bra at the table, so I swiftly pencilled in an afternoon nap. It was at this point that the owner spotted me and made his way in the direction of my table. Oh dear, I thought, this is where things get even more tasty. “Yer stew all right?” he asked, semi-begrudgingly, as if he didn’t really care what the answer was going to be, but was curious anyway. “Incredible,” I said. “I loved it.” “Fine,” he said, and walked off without another glance in my direction. I have paved a way for all of us. Just don’t go in carrying this newspaper. • Cafe 52 52 The Green, Aberdeen AB11, 01224 590094. Open Wed-Sat, lunch noon-3pm, tapas 3-5pm, dinner 6-9pm.

Starters £3.50-£8.50, mains £12-£25, desserts £7-£8, wines from £22.50 It’s always good to acknowledge your weaknesses. I’m beginning to think melted cheese might be one of mine. The menu at Five Little Pigs, a well-dressed, smart little bistro in the Oxfordshire town of Wallingford, lists many interesting-sounding things among the starters: fried anchovies with sage and a bone-marrow aioli catch my eye, as does the scotch egg, enriched with haggis, alongside their own brown sauce. It lists among the snacks, deep-fried olives, stuffed with capers and marjoram. We get some of those to nibble on casually, like deep-fried olives are something we always do, while giving the menu the attention it deserves. They are golden, panko bread-crumbed, salty sour, quail egg-sized orbs of brackish loveliness. They are a good sign. It’s while I’m preparing to take another, that our waiter announces one of the specials: a toastie made with cheese from the nearby Nettlebed Creamery, plus apple and a few dandelion leaves, alongside a dandelion salad. I know immediately that this is going to happen, because it’s a toastie and I am literally incapable of saying no to one of those, even if I should. It’s the utterly domestic, made public. It’s booze food. It’s the thing you eat before going on the lash; the thing you eat while the blood alcohol is peaking, because it seems like a bloody good idea at the time, and always is; the thing you eat the morning after the night before. And now here it is being brought into the polite society of the restaurant, with a dandelion salad. It’s like your dissolute uncle, the outrageous one who never quite worked out where boundaries lay, but who nevertheless manages to comb their hair and put on a suit for a family wedding. But you know that underneath the sweet waft of dry-cleaning fluid and Paco Rabanne, it’s still him. Even as you shake your head at his behaviour, you know you’d be a little disappointed if he cleaned up his act. There is no elevated form of the cheese toastie; no, gastronomically evolved version. Sure, you can forage leaves from the hedgerows of Oxfordshire for the salad, and take care over the choice of cheese, but it still must be its rude, coarse self. The Five Little Pigs toastie is exactly that: golden and a little oily, and crusted in places with rich, salty cheese that has leaked out and made direct searing contact with the iron. The bright, lightly bitter salad does mitigate the richness, but if you didn’t want richness, you shouldn’t have bloody ordered a cheese toastie, should you? The only problem is that it’s so engrossing, so damn good, it might limit space for all the other good things on offer here. But hey: I have a job to do and I will damn well do it. I’ve trained at low altitude. Five Little Pigs, partly named after the nursery rhyme, and partly named after the novel by Agatha Christie, who lived in Wallingford, opened in May 2021, after a successful crowdfunder. It’s a partnership between the owners of The Keep, a local craft beer and gin bar, and the restaurateur Aimee Hunt, who also has Lata Lata in High Wycombe. They make much of their local sourcing, not just from the Nettlebed Creamery, but also fruit and veg from the Clays, a market garden just three miles away run by a former maths teacher, plus Dexter beef and Gloucester Old Spot pork from Blue Tin Produce, five miles away. All of this is a terrific story. It supports the local community and does mean greater transparency in the food chain, even if the claims about carbon sustainability may not bear massive scrutiny; the transport of food is far less important to its carbon footprint than how it’s raised. Certainly, none of this virtuous purchasing matters if the cooking isn’t up to scratch. Here, it really is. Alongside the toastie, which I might already have mentioned, we have the torched, oily mackerel, its skin properly blistered and burnt, with a buttercup-yellow whorl of aioli, and a pile of crisp pickled vegetables. We have slices of seared lamb heart, deep and crimson at the centre, with a few bitter leaves, a little blood orange dressing and a dollop of crunchy green relish. Among the mains is a dark, caramelised venison ragu, which must have started cooking the day before, or the day before that. Or the day before that. It comes on a big heap of soft, buttery polenta, whipped to within an inch of its life, and then lightly sprinkled by a grating of hard cheese, like a snow shower just passed through. No knife required. Fork it away. It’s the best kind of nourishing, invalid food, and supremely comforting even if you’re not under the weather. Another main of a trout fillet, the colour of orange sherbet, comes with fronds of chard, the stems a cheery deep red, slices of potato and a yoghurt dressing. If the venison ragu is designed to make the poorly feel better, the trout dish is just designed to make you feel better about yourself, whatever. It should come as no surprise that, after all the hot cheese toastie action, dessert space is limited. Here, it’s all about rice pudding and ginger cake, and a dark chocolate delice with more of the blood orange that turned up with the lamb hearts. We just about manage to share their big, sugar-crusted doughnut, the winter jam filling of which alters depending on what’s most available. Today it’s rhubarb and there’s a little cardamom-flavoured custard on the side. It feels like another domestic dish brought out into the world of the restaurant. It’s an appropriate bookend to lunch. Pricing for this quality of cooking, with starters firmly in single digits and most of the mains in the mid-teens, is thoroughly appealing. The speed of the kitchen is, I’m afraid, rather less so and I wouldn’t be telling the whole story if I brushed over that. It takes 45 minutes for the starters to turn up. Curiously, I put this down to the restaurant being completely empty when we arrived, and not being especially troubled by much custom after that. The fact is kitchens really get a move on when they are under pressure; when the orders are flying in and the plates are flying out. The old saying, that if you want a job done quickly you should give it to someone who’s busy, applies equally to restaurant kitchens. This one fully deserves to be very busy indeed.

Lunch £7-£13, mains (evenings) £15-£24, desserts £7-£8.90, wines from £19 On a slow news day in the summer of 2016, I became the subject of headlines for giving a Cardiff restaurant a good review. To be fair, it was less the nice things I said about the Classroom, which is staffed by catering students at Cardiff and Vale College, than my assertion that it was a boon to the Welsh capital because the city was short on great eating options. I’d liked both the Potted Pig and Purple Poppadom, basically anywhere beginning with the letter P, but after that, choice had seemed limited. Some people in Cardiff agreed with me. Others were aroused to a frothing digital rage. They sent me lists of terrific kebab, pizza and burger joints, all of which are marvellous things. You’ve got to love a city which boasts a street nicknamed Chippy Alley, for the number of establishments spanking the deep fat fryers. I was dismissed as an insufferable snob; a dreadful flaneur who was only interested in fancy-pants faine daining. Some said I was no longer welcome in the city. This peaked with Marco Pierre White announcing, during a press interview to promote the opening of his new Cardiff restaurant, that I specifically was not invited. Bless him. A man employed to distinguish between the execution of one pig’s head croquette over another really shouldn’t challenge a charge of insufferable snobbery. And yes, I can get as excitable over a bit of gastronomic ambition as the next over-entitled, expense-accounted keyboard jockey. But, in truth, the strength of a country’s food culture is not defined by a handful of gilded gastro-palaces, infested with espumas and granitas, and dripping with chandeliers like crystal tits, but by the presence of those places you’d keep going to repeatedly, because you just want something nice to eat. Happily, a number of interesting-looking restaurants of that sort have opened in Cardiff since my 2016 lunch: Asador 44, Sopra 73, Milkwood, North Star, Heaney’s and its sibling oyster bar Uisce, Thomas by Tom Simmons, Nook, and a few more. Then there’s the Heathcock, a reassuringly solid lump of a pub, located amid the tree-lined lanes of Llandaff to the city’s north, which is where I went, and where I would go again. It’s a second venture from the team behind the Hare &amp; Hounds at Aberthin a few miles to the west of Cardiff. In its pleasingly straightforward approach to the business of feeding people well, it has a touch of St John about it. It feels as though the doctrine of chef Fergus Henderson has been read and fully understood – identify the good things, do them well – and then shaped for the space in which it finds itself. Both the main bar and the dining room next door are white, utilitarian spaces, as are those at St John in London’s Farringdon. Offal is embraced, as it is at St John. Ox heart makes a showing. So do pickled walnuts and duck fat. The bar menu offers a homemade sausage roll, which comes with their own brown sauce. It’s a bronzed, big-shouldered wonder of flaky pastry and dense, well-seasoned sausage meat. There are local ales on tap, including Grey Trees Drummer Boy from Aberdare and Bragdy Twt Lol Twti Ffrwti from Pontypridd. Any suggestion that I am merely copying out words at this point, and don’t have a clue what any of this means, is extremely scurrilous. The point is that the Heathcock is very much a pub which also has a dining room. For £4.20 you can get a three-strong ale flight, plus there’s a heavily French wine list, almost all of which is available by the glass, carafe and bottle. In the evenings the food menu follows a classic starter-main model. There’s lamb with Jerusalem artichokes and green sauce. There’s venison with button mushrooms, roasted beetroot and blackberries. Most of those mains cost around £20. But at lunchtime it’s a selection of small plates only rarely priced into double figures. Slices of cold roast beef, served soft and pink, come curled on a slab of duck fat toast, and topped with hefty fronds of peppery watercress with a big grating of fresh horseradish. More grated horseradish turns up with a silvery fillet of pickled mackerel, alongside a cucumber relish, that reminds me in a sweet, nostalgic way of the stuff in jars that I loved as a kid. Both elements rest on a lake of a sweet-sour blood orange dressing that is so good we ask for a spoon so it isn’t wasted. We have butter-yellow ribbons of pappardelle with a ragu made from rabbit leg that has been braised unto collapse then given a helpful boost from handfuls of chopped tarragon. For texture it is topped with golden fried breadcrumbs. There are slices of salmon pastrami, with a dry, dense texture and a spiced and brown sugared edge, that has me dabbing at the plate for any last crumbs of the massive flavour bomb of a rub left behind on the plate. Chunks of celeriac get the buttermilk fried chicken treatment and come with wild mushrooms and a purée of themselves. Dainty pieces of grilled ox heart arrive perched on what has been described as a duck fat chip. It turns out to be the same as the multi-layered, then deep-fried confit potato that we have ordered as a side. Having two portions of this on the table is no hardship. (Incidentally, I tried making these at home recently courtesy of a recipe from London’s Quality Chop House, which is credited with inventing them. While delicious, they are an enormous, 24-hour faff and should be left to restaurant kitchens.) Our other side dish is hispi cabbage which, in a radical departure, has not been chargrilled. It turns out you can just shred and butter hispi cabbage. Who knew? For a last classical flourish, the kitchen knocks out a perfectly engorged rhubarb soufflé tasting brightly of its star ingredient. There is also a wobbly and gently tart buttermilk pudding with honeycomb and leaves of sweet white chocolate. Even allowing for a pandemic-enforced gap, it’s taken me a while to get back to Cardiff. After a lunch like this I can’t fail but be delighted I’ve returned. Does the thoughtful and thoroughly satisfying cooking at the Heathcock mean I was wrong to be so down on the city’s possibilities back in 2016? No, it just suggests things have changed, and so very much for the better. News bites A large and growing group of chefs and restaurateurs have come together to raise funds for Unicef’s relief work in Ukraine under the hashtag #CookForUkraine. The restaurants, including St John, Sabor, Blacklock and Soho House have so far raised more than £65,000, some by adding an extra charge to the bill, others by putting a Ukrainian themed dish or drink on the menu. The Ukrainian food writer and cook Olia Hercules, one of those behind the venture and whose family are still in the country, said: ‘I don’t want people to get stuck in the headlines and to lose sight of the human beings behind this story. And what’s more human than people getting together and sharing food?’ Restaurants wanting to get involved can email CookForUkraine@gmail.com. Home cooks are also being encouraged to stage fundraising supper clubs. Any donations can be made here. In other Cardiff news Lee Skeet, former head chef of Hedone in London, has more than achieved his crowdfunding goal of raising £25,000 to buy new kitchen equipment for his restaurant Cora in the Welsh capital. After a series of sold-out pop-ups, Cora opened in January. It serves tasting menus costing £50 at lunch and £75 at dinner, and seats just 12 guests. The crowdfunder actually raised over £28,000. The extra money will be invested in new staff and crockery. Elsewhere in Wales, the company behind the vast Celtic Manor Resort just outside Newport is to launch a new seafood restaurant in Milford Haven. Dulse, named after the edible seaweed, will be part of the Tŷ Hotel Milford Waterfront. It will open in April and promises ‘pure freshness from the Pembrokeshire coast and countryside’.

Yes, Didcot Parkway will have its fans, but St Pancras is a destination in its own right, where splendid gothic 19th-century architecture meets shimmery luxury boutique shopping, and it’s also colonised by chic Parisians awaiting the Eurostar and enjoying the Tracey Emin light sculpture. At St Pancras, even the people clanking away on those public street pianos have a working knowledge of Ludovico Einaudi. That said, until now, I’ve never been truly excited by St Pancras’s food offering, although the humongous Wetherspoons, The Barrel Vault, on the ground floor is never anything short of heaving. However, the recent revamp of the Booking Office – a bistro on the first floor, but also accessible via the St Pancras hotel – is interesting for several reasons. At the helm is chef Patrick Powell, who is also behind one of London’s loveliest, and possibly most underrated fine dining experiences, Allegra at The Stratford next to the Olympic Park. Powell is a unique talent, and Allegra’s menu is ever-intoxicating, mixing hearty Irish cooking with intricate French technique and tangential modernity: fried oysters with ginger and seaweed, lobster vol-au-vent with buttered leeks, and chicken in vadouvan spices with pommes Pont Neuf and pickled jalapeños, to name just three. Powell is a fan of classic cooking, but he’s also a feeder and a creator of lavish comfort food. Powell’s menu at The Booking Office 1869 is less fancy-dan, but only marginally so. Yes, there is a house burger and a caesar salad, but there is also poussin roasted over coal, monkfish curry and slow-roast lamb in chermoula. It’s a menu that’s much more ostentatious than a railway station typically deserves, and it’s made all the more gloriously incongruent by Parisian interior designer Hugo Toro’s lavish rethink of the space. Behold, the 8m palm trees and the animal-print armchairs alongside turquoise tiling, which all combine to create a style vibe I’m calling Phileas Fogg Acid-Safari chic. What’s more, the place takes its cocktail list as seriously as the Savoy’s American Bar, so if you were to order, say, an Ol’ Signalman – made from pecan-infused bourbon, Cocchi Rosa and coconut bitters – a man will appear tableside with a blowtorch and start scorching the caramelised pecan nut garnish with both aplomb and due care for your eyebrows. Yes, we are dining in a railway station, but we’re not at the Delice de France kiosk any more, people. I mean, there’s even a raw bar with Irish oysters and tuna skewers with daikon. Those skewers, incidentally, are one of the best things on the menu: top-notch fresh sashimi, all rich with white soy, miso and sesame seeds. The moment I ate it, I thought, OK, this has heavy shades of Allegra. The same goes for the dainty gildas featuring salty anchovy, an olive and a pickled chilli, while the humbly named “fried chicken” turns out to be a painstakingly boned bird, breadcrumbed, deep-fried and served with a lime-infused yoghurt dip. Of all the starters, though, don’t miss out on the cashew hummus. Yes, I know: hummus. Bad hummus is soul-zapping, but good, silky, nutty, oily hummus, such as the one here, is an emotional experience, plus it is topped with a soft-boiled egg and wisps of sliced pickled radish. A Tuscan brussels sprout salad follows with dried chicken skin, dried cranberries and fresh pecorino, all unusual partners for sprouts, which are perhaps a little al dente if you’re planning to mix in polite society afterwards. A plate of cured salmon, chopped and served tartare style, comes with a rösti, the sliced potato erected into a fabulous and delicious turbo-chip. I’ve had similar elsewhere, sure, but I will never tire of spud-based architecture. The Booking Office is not a sedate, genteel restaurant; it is a decidedly lively, slightly noisy, serious cocktail bar that’s filled with well-heeled commuters and guests from the St Pancras hotel, and that boasts one of the best menus within a two-mile radius, an area where competition is fierce yet very hit-and-miss. I couldn’t resist trying Powell’s “fried fish sandwich”, which turns out to be breadcrumbed halibut slices in a glossy steamed white bun with spicy homemade tartare containing fistfuls of gherkin; underneath the bonnet of the bun lies a thick layer of ready-salted crisps. Pudding was a slice of salted caramel tart that, while very edible, was perhaps not the most exciting or freshest I’ve ever eaten, and I still regret not opting for the rhubarb brioche doughnut with cinnamon cream. But I will go back, because it’s in St Pancras station, which I pass through several times a month, along with what feels like the rest of the planet during rush hour. I can’t guarantee that it’ll be any calmer in the Booking Office, but you’ll get properly fed and they’ll make you a very good cocktail. • Booking Office 1869 St Pancras Station, Euston Road, London NW1, 020-7841 3566.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(112,'2021-04-16T09:00:02Z','At last, printed menus and a chance to wear smoky eyeshadow again | Grace Dent on restaurants','In the happy run-up to last Monday’s grand reopening of restaurants and pubs, a fleck of disquiet seeped into the shallower end of my brain. I have craved many things over these recent months of confinement – printed menus, petits fours, the chance to wear smoky eye kohl – but one thing I’d not missed was Fomo (that’s “fear of missing out”, should you not be up on modern acronyms). Fomo is the pernicious, all-consuming suspicion that other people elsewhere are having fun or, in my case as a restaurant critic, eating at better, more exclusive restaurants on nicer tables, which they booked ages ago. If I were to put a face on this hypothetical person, he would be a tall man with shaggy brown hair who plays jazz piano. Let’s call him Jay Rayner. OK, it is Jay Rayner, but, sometimes, it is other people. Fomo is pathetic, but also sinister, because it sabotages your ability just quietly to “be”. Thankfully, it’s at its most acute in teenagers, which is why merely asking one of them to look directly at you for upwards of half a minute, rather than at a phone displaying constantly revolving reels of “other people having fun”, is deemed an act of war. Fomo is more complex still by your late 20s, when it comes with a second layer of the lesser-known Jomo (joy of missing out). This is when anxiety about Friday night Fomo is followed by waking brightly at 7am on a Saturday without a hangover, and with the freedom to make wholesome plans: hot yoga, bottomless brunch and, inevitably, a saunter to a farmers’ market to spend £35 on four heritage parsnips. Pre-pandemic, and now in my 40s, I experienced both Fomo and Jomo, as well as that sharpest, diary-related thrill of all: “High as a kite on cancelled plans.” This is when the date you made six weeks ago to “catch up” at 8pm this coming Friday with an old colleague “for a bite” is cancelled by the other party at 5.20pm, leaving me to haul my grumbling knee home, unhook my bra as I walk up the corridor and drape it over the bannister before eating leftover pasta out of Tupperware in front of The One Show. Actual ecstasy. Then came Covid, and all these things were taken away. But now they’re back, back, back. At the start of April, as whispers began to reach me of other people’s holiday cottages in the Ribble Valley and someone who’d booked the private room at a fun Soho restaurant for every weekend in May, an inner voice told me that I was already way behind. There was a level of emotional calm back in those days when nobody seemed to be having fun, except the Kardashians and the Beckhams, both of whom learned by the 10th internet pile-on to be discreet. Stirred to join the throng of hyper-efficient planners, I booked breakfast at 9am on the opening morning at the Corinthia in Whitehall, London, in its semi-new outdoor area called “the Garden”. I would, I decided, sweep in on a crisp, sunny spring morning wearing a nice frock and strappy sandals, order eggs and drink a big breakfast bloody mary to see off the misery of the previous 12 months. If I’m honest, I touted this plan around like a weapon when anyone told me about their own arrangements. Oh, you’ve got a week booked in a sea-view suite on the Lizard peninsula, have you? Did you know about my 12 April breakfast at the Corinthia? Pardon, what’s that? Your whole family is double-vaccinated and you’ve a light pencil on a Greek holiday villa in late July? Well, did I tell you that the Corinthia garden has hot-water bottles and I’ll probably pop into Kerridge’s Bar &amp; Grill for lunch to eat the swanky, bespoke fish and chips? The problem with this game is, there are no winners; the other problem with plans – especially post-pandemic ones – is that you actually have to go through with them: cancelling is morally iffy when every hospitality venue is already on its knees. So, on 12 April, having alerted everyone to how clever I was to take the momentous day off, I woke up to the sort of wet, sideways snow that isn’t heavy or pretty enough to feature in a Wham! video, but will still take the shine off your scrambled eggs on sourdough because your pants are damp and your hair is welded to your head by melted hairspray. But what struck me most as I set off on Day 1 of Life Mark II was how awry I was about re-entering the real world. And how curiously guilty I felt for carrying on into this fresh next chapter, wobbling towards the light on Bambi legs, when others I’d lost over the past year are no longer here to feel that joy. There was a certain safety in being sat night after night on the same sofa, but we can’t stay there for ever. My plan right now is to stop planning altogether, and remember that life is for living.','https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/apr/16/menus-and-smoky-eyeshadow-restaurants-grace-dent','Grace Dent','At last, printed menus and a chance to wear smoky eyeshadow again | Grace Dent on restaurants',-2.45438910000000021,54.2776946999999907,0.585899999999999976);

Starters £6.50-£9, mains £14-£27, desserts £7, wines from £18 On the morning my train to Liverpool pulled out of London Euston, the media was full of images of other trains: crowded ones, filled with terrified people, fleeing for their lives, an invading Russian army at their backs. I, meanwhile, was going to lunch. That morning Philippa Perry, this newspaper’s agony aunt, was also on a train. With time on her hands, she invited her Twitter followers to ask her anything. Among the many questions was one about how we should deal with the terrible news from Ukraine, especially if we are prone to anxiety. Philippa replied with her familiar brand of wisdom. We should, she said, “Stay in the present and not the hypothetical mythical future. Deal with what is, not what might be. Remember to enjoy yourself as much as possible. It doesn’t help anyone if you don’t enjoy yourself.” It made an awful lot of sense to me. And now I’ll add a thought or two of my own. These thoughts will look like the terrible self-justifications of a man who, in a time of war, is merely reporting from the frontline of lunch. Self-justifications they may be. That doesn’t necessarily make them wrong. People fleeing war want to be safe. They want to be free of the terror of injury or death, free of the fear of the destruction of their families and their homes and their country. But beyond that what they want, what we all want, is normality: to be able go to work, to look after ourselves and our families, to live free of repression and to be able to enjoy ourselves by going to the movies, or yes, out to lunch. We shouldn’t be casual about the importance of normality or dismiss it as irrelevant in a time of dreadful emergency. We should treasure it. Because there’s something else. We are all of us smart enough to hold more than one thought in our heads at a time. We can deplore the appalling barbarity of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, while also wondering where to go for a nice meal out. I’m not big on grandstanding statements about the meaning of life, but I do propose that having a nice time should be a part of it. So let me introduce you to Queens Wine Bar and Bistro in Liverpool which, in dark days, can show you a very nice time indeed. It’s one of those quiet, unassuming places which, without fuss or bother, gets things right in a comforting rather than a self-congratulatory way; where the starters are priced in single digits and the mains are mostly in the mid-teens; where the wine list is engineered to enable you to drink rather than show off. It’s located down Queen Avenue, a narrow shopping arcade of handsome Grade II listed buildings which even the Liverpool Echo once described as one of the city’s “best-kept secrets”. Queens opened in the summer of 2019. In pandemic years, that means it’s barely been feeding people for 12 months, though it feels older: heavily varnished floorboards, dark green walls, wood tables and fatly cushioned banquettes in the bay windows. Next to us is a gentleman of a certain age in a chalk-striped suit, eating alone. He asks for a glass of the “best claret you have”, as if channelling Withnail. The waiter gives him the quiet reassurance reserved for regulars. It’s the kind of place where being a regular would seem like a fine idea. The food is true to the word “bistro”. It involves encouraging ingredients with the occasional flourish, but with nothing to make the eyes widen with too much curiosity, or to distract you from the conversation you’re having over that glass of crisp vinho verde, a blackboard special at £7 a glass. There are cheese croquettes made with Blacksticks Blue, or salt-baked beetroot with hazelnuts and a blood-orange salad. Smoked mackerel toasts are dainty slices of toasted baguette. The fish has been bound in a horseradish cream, then topped in turn by ribbons of pickled onion and dribbles of good peppery olive oil. There are cornichons on the side. Today’s special is a brown crab rarebit so yes, something else on toast, but I’m not complaining: there’s lots of white crab meat packed in there beneath a glazed topping, heavy with the insistent seafood funk of the brown. With it is a vivid salad of radicchio, shaved fennel and capers. It’s a beauty. A large serving of glossy mussels for £15 comes with a mess of cooked-down leeks, in a confidently spiced Café de Paris sauce which is just the right shade of creamy beige. They bring one bowl for the shells and another in which you can clean your fingers. If you don’t need to use the finger bowl, you aren’t doing the mussels properly. A third bowl is full of the frite part of moules frites. They are far too thick-cut to justify the title. Any self-respecting Belgian would disapprove. But we are in Liverpool, not Antwerp. These are site-specific chunky chips. More importantly, they clearly came from this kitchen rather than the ubiquitous freezer bag. They rustle against each other, and have many golden crevices. My companion and I fight each other for them, then mop them in the Café de Paris sauce. The quenelle of celeriac “choucroute” with a pork ribeye, served pink, is closer to a rough purée but I’m not going to get hung up on nomenclature. It lubricates the meat very nicely, alongside a dollop of apple sauce. A side dish of hispi cabbage, the go-to brassica of modern times, is the good kid who’s started hanging out with the wild crowd. What was once a bowl of green veg is now embraced by a fabulously sticky, russet and mahogany mess of crisp lardons and pearl onions in a hugely savoury reduced sherry sauce. Desserts are designed to sustain you through a cold, rainy day in Liverpool: Basque cheesecake, buttermilk rice pudding with honey and nutmeg, crème caramel. We locate space for a slice of a well-made malt and dark chocolate tart, with a filling the colour of a night sky, beautifully thin pastry and a good scoop of chantilly cream on the side. Let’s be clear. None of this will make the world a better place. None of it will make the bad things stop. But enjoying it really won’t make things worse, and it may make you feel a little better. That’s all we can ask of lunch. News bites It’s a big hello to Trampoline, a new café in London’s Islington offering employment opportunities and training to refugees. Trampoline has been founded by the people behind Nemi Teas, and is a partnership with Groundwork, a group of London charities focused on poverty action and the environment, and Hotel School, which provides training in hospitality to the homeless and vulnerable as a way of helping them into employment. Trampoline has also pledged to work with other food-based social enterprises including Redemption Roasters, the world’s first prison-based coffee business. At trampolinecafe.com. Mission Mars, the company behind the Bavarian-themed bar and restaurant Albert’s Schloss in Manchester, is to open an outpost on Bold Street in Liverpool this autumn. It’s set over two floors and will clearly be vast, with two bars, a bakery, a restaurant seating 500 guests, a fresh tank beer system and a stage for live music. Visit albertsschloss.co.uk. There was a palpable sense of gloom in London’s restaurant world when it was announced that Honey and Co, Itamar Srulovich and Sarit Packers’ much loved Middle Eastern café, was having to close after a decade as their lease was up. However, they have now found new premises. They are taking over the site of what was Cigala on Lamb’s Conduit Street in London’s Bloomsbury and should reopen over the next couple of months.

Grolet is one of the greatest patissiers currently walking the Earth. I say one of, because the maker of the world’s most exquisite Paris-Brest or best mille-feuille is a highly contestable matter, but Grolet is definitely in the frame. Having started out at the age of 11 in the kitchen of his grandparents’ hotel in the Loire valley, Grolet was winning awards for sugar art by 15, before going on to work at Fauchon and Le Meurice, both in Paris. This diminutive, sugar-fuelled powerhouse was soon taking on the globe with his increasingly famous trompe-l’oeil artistry. I’ll translate: his specialities include a lemon cake that resembles a lemon and a hazelnut tart that looks remarkably like a hazelnut. He was deemed best head patissier in France in 2015, 2016 and 2017, and a year later won the title of the world’s best pastry chef at the 50 Best awards. Grolet’s bid to spike the blood sugar levels of metropolitan Europe has seen him open a sort-of cafe, sort-of cake laboratory in Knightsbridge, and serve not strictly afternoon tea, but “gouter”, or taster. He has always felt that his work is at its very best seconds after all the piping, spinning, spraying and tweezering finishes, so now customers can sit up and enjoy viennoiseries, cookies and a few savoury items at the counter in this starkly pretty, Rémi Tessier-designed lab area full of white marble, polished stainless steel, shiny, scallop floor tiles and walls carved with flowers and lemons. Or you can sit in a more hotel-lobby-feeling, cushioned area for the gouter menu, for which the tea is served in black cups with no handles, because, well, we’re not in Betty’s tea rooms any more. Obviously, the French would never do anything as gauche or wantonly pleasurable as sit down at 3pm with a heaving cake stand of egg-and-cress finger sandwiches, fairy cakes and trifle, before eating until they’re edging on bilious. Instead, Grolet’s afternoon tea dances with the French idea of bridging the gap between a fine lunch and a proper dinner with a series of small, yet meaningful sweet tastes, just as French parents do for small children. Grolet’s gouter menu, a snip at £90, including tea or coffee, takes place in the Berkeley hotel and features five mini-versions of his classic creations: petite hazelnut, petite lemon, petite Paris-Brest flower, a vanilla flower and his take on the British scone. A Frenchman wading into the UK’s fractious “jam or cream first?” scone debate is either foolhardy or admirable, but Grolet has form. Back in 2017, he released a recipe for scones with a crumble topping, seemingly believing that crunchy scones were something Britain lacked. He may as well have gone to the Tower of London and shooed off the ravens, although I can’t help but sigh at his panache. These days, Grolet’s “scone” has an added layer of marmalade and the toppings are baked within, giving it a similar shape and vibe, but not taste, to a Mr Kipling fondant fancy. Grolet is currently on hand in his new Knightsbridge cafe to explain and justify his techniques, which meant that, on the day I visited, the place was bedlam, with him meeting and greeting a queue of customers snaking down the road all urgently needing to part with £25 for a single full-sized vanilla flower cake. At this point, you might ask: “But how can a cake cost this much, when a Greggs yum yum is about 85p and delivers a satisfying whack of pillowy doughnut without any need to remortgage the house?” This is where Grolet’s laboratory comes into its own, because you can watch him take a wafer-thin pastry case, fill it with a delicate layer of pale vanilla ganache, load in a disc of light, vanilla-scented sponge, brush it lovingly with glossy huile vanille, pipe in the best praline I will ever taste, then leave it all to set, before icing it with mousse vanille in ornate, perfect, concentric petals and creating something that’s almost too beautiful to push down one’s throat. It is impossible to begrudge Grolet his money for this experience. There’s a wonderful video floating around the internet right now in which crafters, designers and artists post videos of the laborious process behind their magical finished products, all accompanied by a chipper song with the lyrics, “It costs that much ’cause it takes me fucking hours! It costs that much ’cause I don’t have superpowers”, and this is very much the case here. Grolet’s souffle, waffle flower and marble flower cake cost 25 quid a pop because they’re not made by machine, or by invisible pixies, but by living, breathing technicians who take spreading marmalade on a scone as seriously as building a Formula One car. Grolet has arrived in London, shaken up afternoon tea and convinced me that £90 is a perfectly reasonable price for five small tarts and a glass of Laurent-Perrier, before sending me off so giddy on praline and huile vanille that I immediately booked his £135 “chef’s choice” tasting menu experience. Grolet is outrageous on many levels, but he does it so very sweetly. • Cédric Grolet at the Berkeley Wilton Place, London SW1. Open all week, 8am-6pm.

That is shameful on my part, because good things are happening in this nook of East Anglia. The Assembly House, for example, one of the UK’s loveliest boutique hotels, offers a storming afternoon tea, the coffee shops around Elm Hill are fabulous, and restaurants such as Farmyard and Benedicts come highly recommended. In fact, overall, Norwich is a great place for structureless mooching, which is my favourite type of break. And then there is Benoli, a modern, three-floored Italian hidden up an alley in the city centre. I tried to look up which part of Italy Benoli was in, only to discover that it’s a combination of the names of brothers Ben and Oliver Boon, in the type of mash-up that has warmed my heart ever since my grandma’s neighbours Ron and Valerie went upmarket and named their terrace house Ronderval in the 1970s. Chef Oliver – a MasterChef: The Professionals finalist who has worked for Gordon Ramsay and was head chef at Roux at the Landau in London – recreates memories of childhood trips to Italy and Sicily, and my pumpkin pasta is the star of today’s show. It is all made by hand, rather than by machine, the pasta is soft, firm and lustrous, and the cappellacci come swimming in a rich sea of sage butter with salted ricotta. There’s no skimping on portion sizes – there can never be too much fresh, pumpkin-filled pasta, after all. Or, for that matter, too many top-quality, purple-hued winter tomatoes, cut once and drizzled in brilliant olive oil. It was a cold, foggy Wednesday night in Norwich, and dinner at Benoli was exactly what we needed. The humble-sounding “parmesan croquettes” from the snacks section of the menu turned out to be fearsome hay bales of mozzarella, potato and parmesan, deep-fried and smothered in another glut of parmesan. They looked more like furious Shredded Wheat preparing for battle than croquettes, and from the moment I set eyes on their cheesy weirdness, I knew that Benoli was no ordinary Italian restaurant. It is the safe option, for Italian restaurants outside the larger British cities, to serve a few pastas and pizzas, and tiramisu for pudding, but at Benoli there is a definite reach towards the strange and the difficult, with the likes of cod and ’nduja kiev with whipped baccalà or a spin on vitello tonnato made with veal belly, maitake mushrooms and flaky, fishy katsuobushi. The menu is hectic and helter-skelter, Japanese-influenced in places, and then – oops – we’re in eastern Europe, which is all fine by me because Boon can really cook. I’d certainly recommend the aubergine caponata, a pleasing chunk of eggplant in a light tempura batter sitting on a tomato sauce laced with furikake. I had fully intended to share this with my dining companion, but sometimes it really is the thought that counts. My friend Ainsley had the gorgonzola tortelli with cocoa, porcini and chestnut, a defiantly rich bowl of pleasure into which I poked my fork numerous times. To my credit, however, we did intentionally share a radicchio salad with a glossy, chive-emulsion dressing. If Benoli was closer to my house, I would eat here a lot. It doesn’t stand on ceremony; so little so, in fact, that you could probably turn up in your dressing gown and the delightful staff wouldn’t turn a hair, plus it’s dimly lit enough for you to get away with being secretly dressed for bed, anyway. The antipasti and pastas are great, but if you’re feeling fancy, they’ll also rustle up a halibut, chanterelles and pancetta fricassea. The pudding they made me, meanwhile, was so starkly weird that it could have come straight off the set of a MasterChef final, with a bed of softened, still-quite-tart rhubarb topped with a pale-pink, almond-butter gelato on some sort of white chocolate-based plinth scented heavily with hibiscus. Did I like this dessert? I am not sure. Did I finish this dessert? Yes, I did – I ate every mouthful, not least because I was trying to work out where the hibiscus was hidden. Was it used to steep the rhubarb? And if I don’t care for white chocolate particularly – as no grown adult really does after their Milky Bar years – why on earth was I licking the bowl? Few things give me greater pleasure than wandering out of a hotel on the hunt for dinner, expecting nothing and finding a local gem. Benoli isn’t perfect – some mouthfuls are just too much, some dishes are erratic, and if you come expecting a soothing plate of dough balls, you may be a bit disappointed – but the Boons are striving, experimenting and delivering some sort of greatness. And they’re doing it all quietly up a side street in Norwich. I won’t leave it another decade. • Benoli 5 Orford Street, Norwich, 01603 633056.

Starters £14-£20, mains £18-£49, desserts £6-£9.50, wines from £29 Restaurants aren’t merely dining rooms with kitchens attached. They are complex machines with invisible moving parts. Get the design wrong and it’s all grind and shudder, as if you’re on a train riding the brakes into Warrington Bank Quay. The design of the LaLee at the Cadogan hotel in Chelsea is all wrong. It doesn’t quite function. It feels like a restaurant put together by excitable designers who were thrilled with their cloth swatches, and their rug choices and the overall branding, but whose attention drifted during the meetings when the hotel’s food and beverage people explained what kind of a joint they actually had in mind. Let’s start with the branding. The LaLee was the name of the personalised railway carriage used by Lillie Langtry, the actor and society figure, when she was touring America in the 19th century. The link being that Langtry’s townhouse at 21 Pont Street is now a part of the hotel. This is not the first time the Cadogan has attempted to cash in on her name. A couple of owners back they opened a car crash of a place called Langtry’s, where the menu included a deconstructed prawn cocktail – shellfish jelly, battered prawns, a Marie Rose ice-cream made from mayonnaise and tomato ketchup – thoughts of which sometimes haunt me in the darkest hours before dawn. None of the food here is as catastrophic as that, but the link is made uneasily. Langtry is portrayed in the menu text as a woman whose only currency was sex appeal; as the proverbial good time had by all. Starters are introduced as “a little flirtation before the main event”. Desserts are “scandalously sweet to make you swoon”. This might work if you were here on a date, but rather less so if, say, you’d booked in for lunch with Derek from accounts so you could go over the year-end numbers. The mains are described as “heavenly main dishes from Europe’s finest cities”. This amounts to a schnitzel, steak and chips, a rack of lamb, an aubergine parmigiana for two and so on, all at Chelsea prices, that price being roughly £30 a pop. It’s sold as high glamour. In truth, it’s a menu designed for well-heeled tourists on the fourth day of their London trip when they can’t be fagged to leave the hotel to eat. So why did I bother going? For one reason: they also promise culinary tableside theatre. I’m a complete sucker for this. I love it when a skilled waiter turns up next to my table with a box of tricks and some killer moves to prepare my dinner in front of me. It’s very old school and it’s utterly beguiling. Here they promise to do the business with both a Caesar salad and a steak tartare. Which is where it all gets a bit messy. A trolley might be a good idea for this. Instead, they’ve got white, spindly- legged wooden tables, which may be very expensive, but look instead like allen key jobs from the Ikea New England Cottage range. Moving them is a two-person task. While we wait to be served, there’s much table moving from one plushly furnished room to another. Oh look, they’re coming back again. Finally, it’s our turn. And it is tableside. It’s just not our tableside. Presumably it’s the designer who has insisted on arranging the room in such a way that the one for the Caesar has to be placed a full 5ft away from us to our left across the aisle next to a booth. The steak tartare table is far over the other side of the unoccupied table to our right. This makes watching the whole theatre you’ve come for very tricky. There simply isn’t room to pull off the thing they want to do. (Similarly, the rug on the parquet floor isn’t big enough for all the tables in this room, so one foot of my chair is off when we arrive, creating an instant wobble. We take things into our own hands and rearrange the furniture.) But as ever, I must accentuate the positive. The waiters do a truly beautiful job, even if we have to crane our necks to watch them do it. The mayonnaise for the Caesar really is whipped up from scratch and the cos salad is big on the salted anchovies, as I requested. The steak tartare is properly piquant, again as requested. A bit of toast wouldn’t have gone amiss with the latter given the £20 price tag, but hey. Still, both dishes really are as good as any you’ll find in London right now. After that, it’s all about as humdrum as you might imagine from the menu descriptions: serviceable lamb chops that could have done with more time under the grill; a meagre half fillet of sea bass for £26 with some fennel; overly thick courgette fries, so the overcoat of batter is undercooked at the heart. Dessert is just unfortunate. A madeleine served warm from the oven is a joy. These are overcooked and dry. The savarin, or yeasted sponge cake at the heart of the rum baba, should be a gorgeous, bronzed and burnished thing. This is just an oversoaked puck of dense sponge. Still, it’s a nice place for dinner and a quiet chat. Or it would be, were it not for the stern man in the next room who keeps shouting. Because the LaLee has a big open kitchen. These can be great in chattery, clattery brasseries where the kitchen noise disappears into the general hubbub. They can also work in those high gastronomic temples where the monastic brigade has developed a sign language involving the positioning of tweezers on their apron straps and imperceptible hand gestures. The LaLee is neither of these. It’s a mildly chintzy place of quiet, civilised conversation, constantly broken by the head chef barking orders at his crew, as if the kitchen is behind a door. For the diners who have chosen the two tables in front of the kitchen I imagine it’s fine. For the rest of us it’s just plain weird. I’ve long felt sympathy for cooks who merely want to do their job, but have been put on display in an open kitchen as part of the experience. Here, because of the jarring way in which the place has been designed, that issue is just emphasised. It rather sums up the LaLee. It’s attempting to be a thrilling destination restaurant, when in truth it should just be the utilitarian dining option in a fancy boutique London hotel. As a result, it’s neither. News bites Ukrainians coming to the UK to escape the war will need more than just somewhere to live. As the government’s delayed scheme to enable people to seek refuge here finds its feet, the Sanctuary Foundation has been established to enable individuals, community bodies and businesses to offer support, including jobs. Krish Kandiah, one of those behind the new organisation, has identified the hospitality industry, which has both staffing shortages and the potential for flexibility, as a potential source. He asks that any businesses which think they might be able to provide employment register their support on the site. Visit sanctuaryfoundation.org.uk. Tim Allen, one-time head chef of Launceston Place in London and the Wild Rabbit at Kingham in the Cotswolds, is finally going it alone.

Lunch £7-£13, all dishes £5-£14.50, desserts £8, wines from £23 In the 1970s, my late mother, Claire, became a regular at a restaurant called Thomas De Quincey’s in Covent Garden. It was named after the 19th-century essayist who had written his most famous work, Confessions of an English Opium-Eater, while living in the same building. If an editor or publisher needed schmoozing she lunched them there, and talked breathlessly afterwards about the ethereally light quenelles of pike mousse they served, but she never took me. I understood Thomas De Quincey’s to be a part of the glamorous adult world to which I had not yet been granted access. A couple of years ago, I ate for the first time at Angela Hartnett’s lovely Café Murano and realised that it occupies the same building at 36 Tavistock Street as Thomas De Quincey’s used to. As a diehard atheist I cannot use the language of ghosts. There is no afterlife. But there was something delightful about sitting in a dining room once occupied so often by my mother. Rooms can ring sweetly with silent echoes. Before it was Café Murano it was a branch of Sofra, for in big cities buildings often retain their essential purpose across decades. In the mid-19th century, for example, 160 Piccadilly, now home to the Wolseley, was a grand restaurant called the Wellington, where they served consommé au naturel, whitebait and pouding à la d’Orsay. Which brings me to 84 Rosebery Avenue in London’s Clerkenwell, not far from where this newspaper’s offices were once located. It has been a series of pizzerias in recent years and before that was a Chez Gérard, which served me very serviceable steak frites. Long before that it was, like so many of London’s great dining rooms, a bank; their underlying architecture suits the modern business of tables, chairs and food. The buildings stay the same. Only the restaurants change. And so I return once more to 84 Rosebery Avenue, which now has the words Double Dragon affixed above the door in bright red neon. Perhaps it’s a reference to the Japanese-made video game, featuring martial arts masters Billy and Jimmy Lee fighting their way through a dystopian New York. I’m not certain, but don’t investigate the term on urbandictionary.com, unless you have a strong constitution; the definitions run from the deeply scatological to the profoundly rude. Either way, it’s described as an extended pop-up that might well become permanent, and belongs to Australian chef Scott Hallsworth. He was once head chef at Nobu London before going it alone with his particularly raucous brand of Asian-inspired, miso-slicked, ponzu-dribbled crowd-pleasing boom and blast. He opened Kurobuta, before selling up and opening Freak Scene. That closed during the pandemic. The website describes this new venture as an izakaya, serving food to go with drinks. I can attest that the food goes very well with drinks. The menu on the current website is lengthy. There’s an enticing section of wood-fired dishes, utilising the oven left behind by the pizzerias. A little disappointingly, the menu currently on offer is shorter and feels like edited highlights. Shame. I very much liked the sound of the kombu roasted sea bass with spicy shiso ponzu, and the wood-fired jumbo prawns with spicy lemon dressing. That said, all the things they are serving very much do the Hallsworth jazz hands thing of parading on to the table and slapping you repeatedly about the chops. When I last ate his food at Kurobuta I whined that, however much I liked his cooking, it was expensive. This iteration is much better value. There’s also a pleasing restlessness to it. We start with a generous £5 dish of Padrón peppers, roasted in the wood-fired oven, sprinkled with sesame seeds and swamped with a mustard miso and lemon dressing. Padrón peppers in gravy: this should always be a thing. The nasu dengaku, or aubergine grilled with a miso glaze, is as good here as I recall it from Kurobuta and comes with the added joy of a candied walnut rubble. Be sure to order the crisp glazed pork belly, in soft folds of doughy bun, with the sticky soy and peanut sauce and house pickles. The fanciest dish is a couple of perfectly cooked, glazed scallops with a yuzu truffle sauce. It’s a hollandaise that’s been on its travels. One observation: it is hard to eat a whole scallop with chopsticks while looking elegant. Perhaps they could slice them in two. Or I could abandon the redundant notion of elegance. In an echo of his Nobu days, but at a fraction of the price, there’s a salmon sashimi “pizza” for £10.50, served on a disc of golden, bubbled cracker with truffle-ponzu and wasabi fish roe. Texturally, it’s a joy, but at first lacks sprightliness. No matter; after last week’s buttered hispi cabbage, here is the great brassica scorched once again in big leaves with an invigorating ponzu, beurre noisette and dried miso dressing. A few drops of that on the salmon sashimi and it comes alive. We also use it as a dipping sauce for well-made spicy tuna maki rolls. These are described as “roulette” because one has been spiked with a seriously hot sauce. It comes with a shot of cucumber sake for whoever pulls the gastronomic trigger. This is of, course, very silly but, like so much here, it’s also an awful lot of fun. There are just two desserts: a chocolate mousse with a coconut ice-cream and a cheesecake with blueberries and a Speculoos crumb. Both are served in glasses and amount to the same idea: creamy things piled on top of each other. They do the job. You can have a look at my pictures of these dishes on Instagram where I am @jayrayner1, but be aware that serious effort was required to make them work. The cream-coloured dining room with its open kitchen is bathed at night in a neon electric purple light which drains out colours. The iPhone torch had to be pushed into service to get a reasonable shot. Expect to see a lot of those torches on display here, because if ever food was made for social media this is it. For once, I mean that in a good way. Not every restaurant has to be profound. Not every restaurant has to be classy. Sometimes it can just be a great night out. Double Dragon has turned what was once home to many a sedate restaurant, into exactly that. News bites Industry body UKHospitality has called for the expansion of pavement licences, a feature of the pandemic, to be made permanent. The scheme, which was introduced last April and is due to expire in September, enabled restaurants to maintain their business despite restrictions introduced to stop the spread of Covid-19. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of the group, points out that the programme, helped by caps on application fees, has driven innovation and revenue for a sector sorely in need of help, and has also invigorated city centres. A 2016 semi-finalist on MasterChef: The Professionals has been hired to head up the kitchen of a new bar and brasserie in Harrogate. Josh Whitehead, formerly the executive chef at the Harewood Estate in Leeds, has put together a menu celebrating ‘exceptional British produce’ for the 180-cover restaurant, located on Cheltenham Crescent. It will open later this month, visit samsonsrestaurant.com. In an attempt to bolster its lunchtime trade, Pizza Express has launched a range of what they are calling ‘pizza wraps’ which, with their cardboard packaging, look much like a savoury version of a McDonald’s apple pie. The products, which are just under 600 calories each, come in five versions echoing the chain’s classic pizzas, including the American Hot, the Padana and the Pollo ad Astra. Currently they are available for take away and delivery and cost £9.50 with a salad. At pizzaexpress.com.

There were times during February 2021, which seemed to last at least 77 days, when I wondered if Britain would ever eat, drink and be merry again. Before my mother’s sparse, heavily restricted cremation, my brother and I kicked about an idea of holding an illegal wake at the drive-thru McDonald’s just off junction 44 of the M6. It was the only place open and serving, and besides, Mam always enjoyed a cheeseburger and fries more than anywhere fancy we took her. We didn’t, in the end, because breaking the rules on mourning wouldn’t have been fair. If strangers had passed by and spotted us in a car park, all dressed in black and holding Big Macs and strawberry milkshakes, they might have said, “Why didn’t we think of that?” and been rightfully furious. This all feels ridiculous now, though; all those wasted, bright, spring days, sat indoors, far from loved ones, doing practically nothing. I’d make an entire morning out of visiting a baker just to smell the fresh baguettes or perhaps choose some elaborate biscuits, before the slow trudge back home for more house arrest. Restaurants and cafes have always been a hobby, a passion, but now that they were closed, I realised that they were more vital for my sanity than I’d ever figured. On 12 April, in England at least, we were permitted to engage in outdoor dining, so I booked in for breakfast at the Corinthia in London with my friend Hugh, which was the fanciest-schmanciest way to eat scrambled eggs on a patio possible. If I’m honest, the whole eating outdoors era of 2021, which lasted all the way until June, took a lot of Pollyanna-level positivity. “I’m so grateful to be out of the house!” I’d think while dining in a repurposed loading bay as gale-force winds attacked the hastily assembled gazebo. Alto at Selfridges was chic and Sicilian, but, let’s be honest, it was still on an Oxford Street rooftop. At the Alma in Crystal Palace, I ate the Korean cauliflower weekly, sitting in the pub’s Noah’s ark-style extension that provided refuge for half of SE19. Another issue that started to raise its head in restaurants around this same time was staffing. Many focused, dedicated, instinctively brilliant hospitality staff had quit the business over lockdown, leaving gaps to be filled by people who had never before carried a plate or mixed a cocktail. Chaos was common, so much so that at times it seemed advisable even to bring your own loo paper. A sense of order began seeping back into the life of this particular restaurant critic only some time around early summer, when lunches at Henrock in Windermere and the Barn at Moor Hall in Lancashire reminded me why Britain is so good at fine dining. A solo Saturday in Hexham, before a book festival, led me to dinner at the Beaumont hotel and a plate of charred mackerel, gooseberry and samphire that alone made the 600-mile round-trip worth it. Honourable mentions for restoring my joie de vivre this year also go to an afternoon spent on the Cheese Barge, eating course after course of fromage in a boat on the Paddington Basin, and to Heritage in Dulwich – modern Indian in an ornate but still hearty manner – where dinner led to an ongoing pining for its shatkora jhinga king prawns and black lentil dal makhani. This was also when things suddenly began to feel wildly positive. It seemed that the worst of times was behind me, so I donated a mountain of flour, pasta and tinned beans, via Olio, to people less cosseted than myself. A balmy summer Saturday on the patio at Adam Handling’s The Loch &amp; Tyne in Old Windsor was utterly perfect: we ate tattie scones with melted blue cheese and gingerbread trifle, and drank cocktails made with Irn-Bru, then drove home listening to loud Deacon Blue and Big Country. Special mentions this year should also go to new noodle chain Marugame Udon, which taught me the joys of tempura egg, kakiage and the £3.45 kamaage (AKA plain, slippery udon dipped in a smoky fish dashi). And to Sessions Arts Club in Clerkenwell, where Florence Knight’s food shot it directly into the top three places I send people seeking an exciting London dining experience that won’t feel stuffy, seen-it-before or simply a rip-off. Cafe Cecilia in Hackney is similarly cool and delicious, but you’ve got more chance of getting in to see Pope Francis for a quick chinwag than scoring a table there before next Easter. As I write this, I worry that we’re again slipping towards the dark days of midwinter restrictions. Each time I sit in a busy dining room, full of laughter and chatter, I wonder whether we’re very quietly back on the brink of forced closures, rules of six and “let’s all eat in the car park”. And of “let’s have a wake in a McDonald’s drive-thru with double nuggets and a McFlurry with Smarties”. But, actually, let’s not, because the rules say we can’t, and it would be rude to other sad people to break them. It’s been a hell of a year in more ways than one. Next year, though, I have literally no idea what’s on the menu. • Episode nine of the second series of Grace’s Comfort Eating podcast is released on 21 December.

A couple had foolishly arrived for their Saturday-night booking, imagining there to be an à la carte menu, rather than just a bespoke seven-course experience that lasts about three hours. “But we went out for lunch,” they pleaded. “We’re too full to eat the full seven courses. Can’t we have just, say, three?” Sadly, this was impossible. Unthinkable, even. It was the full shebang, or nothing. A painfully polite, low-volume “discussion” then ensued, during which the server made no attempt to consult the chef. Or even offer a goodwill gesture to cancel, say, the “baguette française, Normandy butter” course, or the Victoria pineapple plate that comes around the midway point. It was almost as if the staff already knew that not one amuse-bouche could be missed. “Well, we’ll go then,” the customers eventually said, calling Renaissant’s bluff. A long silence hung in the air, followed by the sound of footsteps crunching across the car park gravel as the pair huffed back to their car. It was only 7pm. I hasten to add that the handful of staff at this beautifully restored, 17th-century pub were charming about our own request to take pork off the menu; they’re not tyrants. Yet Renaissant, the rebirth of the Blackbird, which was also run by Robinson and his wife, Marliz, is a determinedly serious restaurant. Not that its predecessor wasn’t itself pretty serious – the Blackbird had a Michelin star but at least you could get a Sunday roast or even a burger there – perish the thought. Renaissant is much more scallop à la russe and wild boar africaine, with a framed menu from Marco Pierre White’s Harveys on the wall and Edith Piaf on the stereo. As one arrives on a crisp winter’s evening, the outside is secluded, glowing and pristine, and all quite heavenly. Inside, the decor is sleek, but still strangely rustic. Robinson describes the place as a “sauce restaurant”, which, for a certain contingent of readers, I must add has nothing to do with his love of HP and everything to do with Georges Auguste Escoffier’s kitchen brigade system and the culinary tradition of classic sauces such as Véronique, lie de vin or Nantua. Producing top-tier sauces, gravies and stocks is a long-winded, highly skilled labour of love that has been known to break the spirit of many an adequate chef and is the crux of a traditional Michelin-starred meal. Which is possibly why you can’t just pitch up here and say: “Just sling me the fillet of brill lie de vin. I need to be back before Ant and Dec’s Limitless Win.” So, yes, three hours we stayed, with course one being warm bread, then a fairly long gap before the second act, a play on Russian salad involving brunoise potato, beetroot and carrot set in a mould and topped with scallops – a bit like a shuba herring salad and delicious, if a touch stodgy. Up next was a large, delicately executed crayfish raviolo featuring good fresh pasta enveloping a crayfish tail that came on a scallop and salmon mousse, and was served with a very sweet sauce Nantua made with crayfish stock, parsley and rather a lot of diced carrot. There is no doubt that Robinson is a confident, technically brilliant chef who worships at the altar of kitchen gods such as Nico Ladenis and the Roux brothers. His cooking is a paean to butter and time spent huddled over pans, and to dancing a fine line between the almost-too-rich and the almost-too-much. It’s just that type of cooking, and it won’t be for everyone. It certainly wasn’t for those two guests who “amicably agreed” to go home. But there’s a reason a certain type of chin-stroking, star-watching food obsessive is pitching up at Renaissant. After another long intermission, a very delicious plate of thinly sliced Victoria pineapple appeared topped with ricotta, powerfully scented marjoram leaves and a scattering of pine nuts. Hour two heralded my favourite course – seared brill with pomme puree in a world-class, glossy, red-wine sauce and topped with a clove of mellow roast garlic – followed some time after by a cheese course that included comté and bleu d’Auvergne with a highly unpretentious half-dozen Carr’s water crackers, and I now fully expect to be barred from my home city for raising an eyebrow. Over the course of the third hour, there was a pear-based, egg-cup-sized palate cleanser and two choices of dessert, of which the better was a slab of dark-chocolate Negus mousse – fiercely rich, yet deceptively light – with armagnac-soaked prunes, which are one of my favourite things on Earth and technically one of your five-a-day. Renaissant is a bizarre, 19th-century Cannes aristocrat’s supper room hiding in a hamlet outside Newbury. If you’re into that type of thing, by all means give it a go.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(122,'2021-12-05T06:00:47Z','Unalome by Graeme Cheevers, Glasgow: ‘Self-consciously ambitious’ – restaurant review','Unalome by Graeme Cheevers, 36 Kelvingrove Street, Finnieston, Glasgow G3 7RZ (0141 501 0553). Three courses à la carte £80, tasting menu £90, wines from £34 At the start of our dinner at Unalome by Graeme Cheevers, which is an awful lot of syllables for just one restaurant name, our waiter announces solemnly that before we are allowed to see the menu, we will be brought some canapés “to entice the palate”. I’m sure my spirits are meant to soar at this; instead, they sag. I’m not really sure I need my palate enticed. It’s fine as it is, thank you. Nevertheless, there is enticement in my future. The first two canapés are solid enough: there’s a warm cheese gougère with a liquid centre, and a doughy miniature brioche bun, pelted with truffles and Ibérico ham. The third canapé, a crisp pastry tube filled with foie gras mousse and decorated with tiny leaves, is presented on a bowl of pebbles, as if someone dropped it in the gravelled car park of a country house hotel. The mere use of an ingredient that I expect to be prohibited soon on grounds of animal cruelty tells us exactly where we are: wading through lakes of self-conscious, sod-you luxury. For emphasis, the website describes this restaurant as “the ultimate dining experience”. That takes the cliché “hostage to fortune” and adds go-faster stripes, turbo injection and one of those huge, redundant aerofoils that men desperately overcompensating for something put on the arse end of their Ford Escorts. Were the claim to be true, I’d never need to eat in a restaurant again after having eaten here. For the record, I do need to eat in a restaurant again. It’s all a little overheated and sweaty palmed. Even the name Unalome is grandiose. It refers to a lovely Buddhist symbol of curls and spirals which, according to various definitions, represents nothing less than the entirety of human existence or the very path we take in life. That’s an awful lot for three courses plus canapés and a pre-dessert to live up to, even at £80 a head. Or £90 if you go for the meat or vegetarian tasting menu. But then the ambition here really is not small. Shortly after news of the launch broke in the restaurant world (in November 2020), I received an email from someone involved with the business, breathlessly telling me this may well be the place that would bring a Michelin star back to Glasgow, as if that would somehow make the city a better place. Nowhere is improved by having Michelin-starred restaurants. Nor is it a lesser place for not having one. What it comes down to is this: chef Graeme Cheevers has twice held a Michelin star, first at Martin Wishart’s restaurant by Loch Lomond, then at the lovely Isle of Eriska Hotel. Now he has opened here and he has similar ambitions. Obviously, the man can cook. One of the three available starters features two plump langoustine, with cloud-like gnudi – think gnocchi only made with ricotta rather than potato – and a soothingly rich, creamy sauce, the flavours boosted with sansho pepper and the citrus burst of finger lime. A main course saddle of venison is on point and comes with a deep, sticky jus and a silky pumpkin purée. I am particularly taken by a foamed pre-dessert of lime and passion fruit with galangal and lemon curd. The pre-enticed palate is fully cleansed. All of this is solid, neo-classical cooking. Which is exactly what you would expect at this price. But there are eye-widening weirdnesses. Another starter brings sweet, sticky slices of marinated scallop with the forest-floor flavours of puréed mushroom and hazelnut below, and a spritz of clementine above. For decoration there is silver leaf because, well, it’s the ultimate dining experience and all that, even though, as with that nice Mr Salt Bae’s gold-leafed steaks, it serves no purpose. But that silver leaf does have a visual impact. This is meant to be a seafood dish. Instead, the combination of silver foil, nuts, citrus and sweetness is firing off thoughts of cornershop chocolate confectionary. It’s plain odd. The roasted cauliflower on a main course cod dish is pleasing but the fish itself, presented as a cylinder, is a little mushy. Of our two desserts, the winner is the chestnut parfait with Windsor apple and a sharp apple mousse. It tastes soothingly of autumn. Less successful is a pear and caramel tart. It’s pretty but seems to have been over set to become curiously rubbery. Some of these points may seem like pedantry. Certainly, whining about the sourdough being served cold could be taken as such, so I won’t mention that. But the rest of it is merely holding the restaurant to its own standards. Talking of which: what’s up with the room? Unalome occupies a set of interlocking spaces in a big-boned sandstone building. Effort has gone into the design. There are leather banquettes, parquet floors and honeyed panelling. They’ve done all of this. Then they’ve left the big light on. It’s both brightly and flatly lit. It doesn’t feel like a space in which to linger even though, given the minimum requirement to have three courses, you must. Have I once again broken my promise not to publish negative reviews? Well yes, I suppose I have, but for the same reason I did so last time. Unalome is expensive. Our bill, with a pre-dinner drink each, a £46 bottle of albariño from the very lowest reaches of the list and service, was £250. That’s a lot of anyone’s money anywhere, which creates expectations, and telling us you are great, really is not the same as being great. I will not pretend. My appetite for this sort of self-consciously ambitious restaurant with its tasting menus and flummery has waned. I do not want to sit in hushed dining rooms, sparsely occupied by muttering people on their best behaviour, waiting to be enticed and wowed. I decided, given its own pre-publicity, to give this one a go. Perhaps that was my mistake. Below Unalome, in the building’s lower ground space, is a 15-year-old bar called Big Slope, where they serve a vegan-friendly menu of pizzas, burgers and the like. I could see the cheery, grinning faces of the clientele through the windows inside as I left. They all seemed to have had a much better night out than me.

These restaurants have survived the Covid maelstrom. In Knightsbridge, a petty little pandemic wasn’t going to stop the Nusr-et juggernaut rolling into town, foisting its grotesque, gold leaf-wrapped steaks at the cerebrally awry, while over at the Savoy, Gordon Ramsay is on the verge of opening a second restaurant serving caviar on nori waffles. The list goes on, but Bibi – a modern Indian restaurant on North Audley Street, where rows of Bugattis, Bentleys and Rolls-Royce Phantoms park to pick up a few bits of grocery from Selfridges food hall – proves that not all high-end restaurants are built equally. It is backed by the JKS group, which also owns Gymkhana, as well as numerous other well-loved restaurants such as Hoppers, Lyle’s and Bao, although it is the incessantly booked-up and undoubtedly groundbreaking Gymkhana that Bibi puts me in mind of most. Since my dinner at Bibi on a recent Friday, I’ve recommended this odd, experimental, beautiful restaurant for both date nights and those needing to lovebomb clients. Yes, it’s not cheap and cheerful – a small, delicate plate of raw Highland beef pepper fry with fermented Tellicherry peppercorns costs £14, while five pieces of okra will set you back £8 – but the fragrant okra is like nothing I’ve tasted elsewhere. I’d happily bathe in its peanut sauce, sploshing it about my armpits and behind my ears, before dressing without showering. Bibi’s chef, Chet Sharma, is a trained physicist who worked at the Ledbury, Gymkhana and Moor Hall before becoming JKS’s head of menu development. He is part genius and clearly part subversive, as are all the best people to leave in charge of your dinner. You’ll know this from the moment you step into his new restaurant, sit up at the counter, take in the mock-Rajasthani design and gleaming, mango wood furnishings, and order a plate of sweetcorn kurkure, which are absurdly compelling, deep-fried bullets of kernels rolled in at least 20 spices and served hot and crisp. They pair perfectly with a kulukki sharbath, a cloudy Indian lemon juice with a green chilli kick and laced with sabja seeds, which lend it a delightful, frogspawny texture. Sharma’s other bar snack is a Wookey Hole cheese papad, or heavenly, luxury, super-sized Quavers with a cultured cream dip layered with mango preserve and green chutney. Bibi’s pretty polished floors, ornate ceiling, gloriously obsessive menu (it details where on the subcontinent every spice hails from) and precise, professional and deftly drilled service all add up to the sensation that here is a place that takes hospitality very seriously. And perhaps that’s another reason I loved it so much, because there are a lot of headless chickens running about at the moment. The Bibi team is definitely not one of those; JKS has put its best players in here, and now is the time to take advantage of them. Dishes are undeniably rather small and supposed to be shared, although your average, fork-wielding heffalump such as myself could easily finish them alone. Do not mistake, say, chukh masala tikka for a saucy vat of crimson-coloured chicken; it is instead a small portion of marinated boneless thigh, a succulent and Vesuvius-hot spin on the curry house classic – Charles has been raving about it for days and days, and nagging me to go back so he can try the Lahori chicken with cashew and yoghurt whey. Buffalo paneer is similarly brief and meaningful, barely larger than a credit card, but I still remember its dainty, milky texture and the taste of the charred onion and pepper fresh from the Sigree grill that titivates many of Bibi’s dishes, while I suspect that the achari Swaledale lamb saddle, at £16 for two chops, will become one of the place’s signature dishes. I mostly grazed around the vegetable side of the menu, dipping numerous roomali rotis into oozy puddles of rich, grass-fed ghee dal and finishing off the kaima yakhni pulao rice that’s simmered in chicken stock. Every dish was unusual, unexpectedly presented and a playful reimagining of a classic, which is exactly how I felt about Gymkhana all those years ago. JKS has a habit of creating dishes to puzzle and obsess, while rewriting the playbook in a self-effacing manner; it’s the antithesis of Salt Bae and his £100 burgers that will change your life (spoiler alert: they will not). I rarely eat dessert in Indian restaurants, because I’m never disciplined enough to leave room for a final hurrah, but at Bibi they’ve even thought of that and offer tiny preserved mango kulfi ice lollies, a bit like Mini-Magnums, and all silky-sweet and soothing. Bibi has made 2021 bearable. I don’t have a Bugatti to get there, but when I sit upstairs at the front of the Number 73, it feels as if I’m driving, and that’s just as good. • Bibi 42 North Audley Street, London W1, 020-3780 7310.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(124,'2021-11-19T12:00:34Z','Cafe Cecilia, London E8: ‘Hot but with a homespun edge’ – restaurant review | Grace Dent on restaurants','Cafe Cecilia in Hackney, east London, put to the test the question that strangers often ask me, which is: “So, can you get a table anywhere at any time?” The answer is complex, but, for shorthand, I always reply: “Yes!”, when I really mean: “Usually yes, but sometimes no, depending on myriad variables, including the ‘hotness’ of the establishment in question, the pliability of its maître d’ and, of course, my own cunning while trying to inveigle my way in.” For now, let’s concentrate on hotness, which has nothing to do with its suitability for the peri-menopausal, but rather the almost tangible fervour that surrounds certain new openings. Cafe Cecilia, which recently appeared just off Broadway Market on a relatively charmless side road close to an old gasworks, is run by Max Rocha, a chef with connections to the River Cafe and St John, and heavy links to the fashion industry, with both his father and sister, John and Simone, being much-loved designers. This type of buzz inevitably leads to all 15 or so tables being booked up for weeks in advance, while every lunchtime another tempting array of social media reports seep into the ether, showing us the likes of pig’s head, sage and potato pie, cuttlefish with orzo, pork braised in milk with fresh coco beans, raspberry galette and Guinness by the can. I hope Cafe Cecilia can forgive me for pointing out its hotness, because in the past I’ve found that some restaurants blanch at this elusive, sparkly tag. It’s a bit like telling a top model how ruddy gorgeous they are, only to be greeted with a, “Well, yes, but I have very serious thoughts about the Tibet Autonomous Region, too.” Hot restaurants do not want to be merely hot and filled to the rafters with hot-restaurant chasers. No, they want to be respected and loved for their skills, the provenance of their ingredients and their authentically influenced recipes made with modern twists. They want to be hot in meaningful ways, not merely because Doris from the Emotional Support Squirrels did her latest Rolling Stone interview there. Anyway, what is for certain is that “hot” restaurants such as Cafe Cecilia do not need critics to love them, so me sweeping in on the off-chance of a free table (the one restaurants always have up their sleeve just in case Barack Obama and his security detail are passing by) was not going to cut it. Instead, I booked almost six weeks in advance, then pondered who to bestow this magical treat on, before settling on my old friend Dave, who is not a hot-restaurant chaser at all. I found him sitting in a white, concretey room with plain brown tables and no tablecloths – in fact, no decor of note whatsoever – perusing a list of pig’s head terrine, crisp fried sage leaves with anchovy, and deep-fried bread-and-butter pudding with cold custard, almost as if it were just a normal room, and we were not, in fact, behind the velvet rope and living our best London lives right there and then. Obviously, it would make a fantastic denouement if Cafe Cecilia turned out to be a terrifically dull dud, but it’s not. It’s a calm, self-effacing space with lovely staff and a menu that allows Rocha to lean on his Irish heritage via the likes of mussels steamed in cider and bacon, Guinness bread ice-cream and barmbrack with a heap of freshly churned butter. Notions of Ireland, and of St John, were alive in Rocha’s ham hock terrine, which was the piggiest slice of rough-and-ready paté I have witnessed in my lifetime. For the more squeamish, I’d recommend a balm-like plate of silky agnolotti filled with goat’s curd and Fellows Farm squash and swimming in a glossy, buttery sauce, which, at £13.50, is a far cry from River Cafe prices. A whole plaice, grilled to crispness, but with soft, white flesh, came festooned with steamed clams and a side of pink fir potatoes, which are my very favourite spud, or at least were until last year, when my attempts to grow these pretty, nutty vessels of joy resulted in sad, stubby bullets and a lot of sulking. At Cafe Cecilia, they have deep-fried pink firs on the menu, as well as peculiarly delightful plates of deep-fried sage and anchovy fritti, which you may love or loathe, but will certainly never forget. Cafe Cecilia isn’t really a cafe, even if its opening hours until recently – short breakfast sittings and lunchtimes, and only now beginning dinner service on Fridays and Saturdays – give the place a homespun edge, rather than the feel of a new rumbling hospitality juggernaut. Even so, I have a sense that it’s really only just getting started on its path to being one of London most serious restaurants. Hotness comes and goes, but genuinely very good can last for ever. • Cafe Cecilia Canal Place, 32 Andrews Road, London E8, 020-3478 6726.

A pivotal moment in my restaurant-reviewing career came when, just after eating my porcini croquettes, I downloaded a decibel-monitoring app on to my phone. There was something brazenly cranky about doing so, true, and it was without doubt cringingly uncool, too, but after a certain age, you just don’t bloody care and it’s marvellous. In Bibo’s defence, however, this had been brewing. Many restaurants these days are far too noisy. I can tell this by how, in some places, I have to lipread my guest from almost the second I’m seated or nod pointlessly while I guess the rough gist of what they’re telling me. And how, time and again, I suddenly become quite subdued, because going into detail during an anecdote is futile. Dinner with friends is all about telling stories, and stories are all about detail; they are also about timing and red herrings and withholding information until the perfect point. And none of that can happen at places such as Bibo that, my new app told me, play dance music at 84 decibels. Am I the only person who, when cooking in my own kitchen, turns down the radio to concentrate when I taste and season, as if my senses can properly focus on only one thing? Bibo has taken over the space that restaurant fans may remember as Marcus Samuelsson’s Red Rooster in the Curtain hotel, and now the London outpost of the Mondrian group. Bibo, in the basement, is admittedly slap-bang in central Shoreditch, so many visitors will want, nay, expect it to be loud and more like a cocktail bar or club that serves a few tapas mainly to line stomachs. But I say: no! There is something about its modern Spanish, sophisto-tapas menu, its decor and, well, its marketing as a formerly three Michelin-starred chef’s passion project that suggests it should instead feel more like spending a sultry, elegant evening in Madrid, nibbling oxtail brioche and pulpo a la gallega in a genteel, terracotta-tiled room with well-kempt floor staff bearing glugging fish jugs. And the front of house are certainly warm, prompt and full of recommendations about your order and, on the surface at least, the place has the look and feel of a fancy-ish Spanish restaurant. The open kitchen full of harassed-looking chefs is definitely up to something. Our first course, those aforementioned porcini croquettes, were earthy and delicate enough, but they were also lukewarm and uncrunchy. The tiny, slider-style oxtail brioche bun was one of the best dishes we tried, featuring a rich, pulled oxtail stew that had clearly had some serious TLC. On the other hand, the broccolini salad, which we were heavily sold, featured a rather sickly black sesame mayo that I had no urge to wolf down. And the signature tortilla brava was a tepid, sloppy mess, and its brava sauce and mayo topping had gone all Jackson Pollock before it reached the table. And did I mention that the music crept ever louder with every plate? If standards are quite blasé in the kitchen, it’s not entirely surprising, because the food seems secondary here. Due to the noise levels, I missed the finer details of the explanation that came with our huevos rotos: four eggs fried tableside before being mixed into some cooked but now lukewarm chips. As any fool knows, eggs with potatoes is a timeless, winning combo both in the UK and all over Spain, but when you’re confronted with a large, oval plate of underseasoned mush, it feels more like a challenge. Butterflied bream, cooked for rather too long, came with an attractively vivid bell pepper sauce that also lacked seasoning. We rescued it with some lime wedges from another dish. A reportedly caramelised rice pudding was again rather cold, and there had apparently been no attempt to make it enticingly crunchy and bronzed, because it came scattered with raw brown sugar. The chocolate mousse was topped with a thick layer of set chantilly cream, and was the other truly decent dish we had that night. By this point, however, it was pushing 9pm and the noise levels were louder than a nightclub at midnight. This became especially evident when a jolly, young woman at a nearby table kept standing up, waving her arms and heading off to find the dance floor, before being reminded by her companions that she was at dinner and that those were her croquettes. Each time, she sat down thwarted, glum and incarcerated. Here I was in a restaurant that felt like a nightclub, shoving down mousse and desperate to be liberated; and there she was in a nightclub, being forced to eat a full square meal and equally desperate for freedom. Which of us Bibo is aimed at remains a bit of a mystery, but in this instance, I’ll graciously step aside. • Bibo at The Mondrian, 45 Curtain Road, London EC2, 020-3988 4455.

Starters £5.80-£9.80; large dishes £9.80-£24.80; hot pot £18-£38.80; whole fish £36. Wines from £19.80 All parents will retain a deep affection for any restaurant where their once small children were happy, and the family therefore harmonious and nobody died and can we all go home now please? It’s why Pizza Express retains the love of a slab of the British middle classes, despite endless whining over the current quality of the pizzas, and the silliness of the one with the hole in the middle, and the blood-sucking endeavours of venture capital firms. They have managed to retain a culture that is welcoming to small kids, without infantilising their weary parents. It’s a neat trick. And if you still want to rant about why Pizza Express is terrible, please take it up over on Reddit. Someone there will be gagging for your hot take. I have similar warm, fuzzy feelings about the premises at number 46 Gerrard Street in London’s Chinatown, with its arched marble frontage. For many years it was an extremely reliable Cantonese place called Harbour City. My boys loved the dim sum there when they were small, and so did I. The fluffy, cloud-like char siu buns had an uncommon citrus kick. The har gow were spot on. A Sunday lunchtime at Harbour City was always a good one. Recently the website Eater London, an offshoot of the US Eater empire, published a list of 38 “essential” London restaurants. If you don’t know Eater London, think of them as the cool boys on the back seat of the school bus of the food journalism world; the ones who listen to those bands you’ve never heard of and yes, they’ve got a girlfriend, she just goes to another school. But the thing with the cool boys is, secretly you always wanted to listen to those bands to find out what was so great about them. Because maybe that would make you cool, too. Included in that essentials list alongside reliable bangers like Mangal 2, Trullo and, er, the River Café was a Sichuan restaurant called Food House, which they said was “the trendiest restaurant in central London”. In keeping with the whole back-seat-of-the-bus thing, it was so trendy, so cool, I’d never heard of it. I squinted at the address. Blow me: it occupies the location of what was once Harbour City. Naturally, I booked. Going by the carpets I’d say little has been done to the joint in years. But this is a very different type of restaurant from the one I knew. It is all the grand, jumpy, thrilling, chilli and numbing peppercorn hullabaloo that those of us addicted to the Sichuan repertoire just adore. I believe you’re meant to say that Sichuan food is not just about chilli heat, it’s about flavour. And, of course, it’s not just about chilli heat. But actually, it also is. There’s even a samovar-style decanter of bright red oil, full of chillies, on the bar so they can dispense it at the turn of a tap, like absinthe. If I had brought my boys here when they were small, they would, faced by all this, have tugged at the sleeves of strangers and asked to be taken to a place of safety. Or perhaps a plate of safety. Food House is full on, in a very good way. One of the dishes regularly talked up online is the fearsome sounding red chilli oil noodles. It’s actually one of the more soothing platefuls: broad, ragged-edged ribbons of noodle the colour of a baby’s teeth, come slicked with just enough of the crimson oil to remind you where you are. We have it topped by friable pieces of long braised lamb. It’s comfort food for when you’re caught in a winter storm, or like to imagine you might be. Before we get to that there are other thrills. There is the barbecue menu of things on skewers, roughed up with cumin, salt, chilli and the occasional dab of sugar. Often, these can be mimsy affairs, delivering seized up pebbles of hard matter. Here, the red willow twig lamb skewers are solid, chunky pieces of still smoking baby sheep. There are also skewers of lamb kidney which, arriving with a cloak of crispy fat, must be eaten while still hot. I understand that offal and its fat may not be everybody’s thing. They are my thing. We have king prawns which, under the heavy hand from the spice mix, seem to become even sweeter. Alongside this there are silky-skinned, pan-fried pork and cabbage dumplings that leak their juices down my chin. It is an attractive look. We have Yu Xiang aubergine (eggplant, on this menu) in a deep glossy gravy and, from the broad selection of offal dishes, a heaving plateful of more kidney in a hot and sour sauce. When I called to book, I was asked if I wanted the hot pot. It’s a big thing here. I’ve tried them elsewhere and never quite enjoyed them as much as I think I should. This is partly because, however varied a list of ingredients you get to drop in the boiling stock or oil, it all ends up tasting rather similar to me. It’s also down to incompetence. I usually end up sticking a chilli-dipped finger in one eye or the other. Instead, we have another of their big statement dishes: a whole seabass to share, first roasted so the skin and the flesh along the tail where it narrows, is crispy. It has then been plunged into a bath of chilli oil, bobbing with dried chillies and slices of lotus root, sprigs of coriander, halved cloves of garlic and so much more. It is magnificent to behold, as if it has its own stage lighting system, and justifies its price of £36 on those dashing looks alone. It is not, however, simple to eat. We get in there together, working our way around the bones to get at the prized flesh. But it is very much worth it: there is a sweetness to the soft fish, stained red by its vigorous liquor. It can get messy. Either wear a bib, or don’t wear a white shirt. Perhaps don’t bother with clothes at all. It’s a pretty laid-back place. Drink bottles of Yanjing beer to soften the burn. I shall have to take the word of the cool boys on the bus that this is a very trendy restaurant. I long ago mislaid the ability to recognise what is fashionable and what is not. But I can say it’s an awful lot of fun. I have a great reason at last to return to 46 Gerrard Street. Jay’s news bites In the January edition of OFM I featured six chefs worth watching in 2022, among them Helen Graham of the lovely Middle Eastern vegetarian restaurant Bubala, in London’s Spitalfields. She and her business partner Marc Summers have just announced a second Bubala, this time in Soho on the site of what was the venerable Italian Vasco &amp; Piero’s Pavilion. The 50-cover restaurant will open in April (bubala.co.uk). Per Diem is a new food and household goods delivery service which, in its own words, sets out to do the boring things ‘really very well’. It offers only the very basics – dry pasta, flour, sugar, rice, cleaning materials and so on – but only one good example of each, sourced from independent suppliers. Right now, therefore, there are just 50 items on the site. Products can be ordered as needed or on a monthly basis and they also offer a packaging-free re-fill service (getperdiem.com). Rosa’s Thai, which has branches nationwide, is attempting to tackle the hospitality industry skills shortage by launching its own chef training programme. Wok School will operate out of the ground floor of its restaurant on Warren Street in London and will offer courses of varying lengths. Participants will be paid £11.45 an hour, and their dishes will be served to customers at a 50% discount. Participants who complete the course will be offered a job at the end (jobs.rosasthai.com/wok-school).

Small plates £7.50-£14, mains and hot pots £16.50-£29, desserts £5.50, wines from £22 Do not go to Claw &amp; Hammer on a date. Or to be more exact, do not go to Claw &amp; Hammer on a first date. Go on a seventh or eighth date, when the deed has been done, and you’ve already seen each other being about as messy and human as it’s possible to be. Then this restaurant on the eastern edge of the City of London, which specialises in southern US seafood boils, will be just the thing. Because this is very much a hands-on, up-to-your-armpits place. The food is so gloriously prone to chaos and disorder that the main events are delivered not just with crab claw crackers and crabmeat picks, but also with blue latex gloves. “Although I wouldn’t bother with the gloves,” our cheery, cheerleading waiter said. I told him I wasn’t planning to. I’d come for dinner, not to perform an internal examination. Wet wipes would do me fine. I noted that those on other tables who had gloved up, were still able to scroll on their phones. They were probably Instagramming, which is very important in a place like this. Just look at the size of those king shrimp, and so on. It did, however, make them look like they were hunting down a differential diagnosis, while getting deep into the seafood action. Claw &amp; Hammer shouldn’t work. Seafood boils tend to draw much of their impact from context. You want gnarly wooden picnic tables spread with newspaper or at the very least spread with paper designed to look like newsprint, perhaps filled with fake stories referencing someone called Bubba or Fat Al. You want 100% humidity and forearms glistening lightly with sweat, and permission to get properly stuck in. The one time I did a seafood boil in rural Louisiana, I carried away with me the sultry waft of roasted prawn head and boiled crab shell for the rest of the day, as if it was an especially obscure eau de cologne designed specifically for the belly-obsessed. Who needs Givenchy Pour Homme Blue Label, when you can wander around smelling like a bowl of spicy bouillabaisse? The interior of Claw &amp; Hammer has a lot of raw wood panelling, as well as bare-brick walls overlaid with wire grids. It’s designed to convince you that you’re in an authentically hard-scrabble, pseudo-industrial place where nobody need stand, or sit, on ceremony. Naturally enough, the ceiling’s industrial workings are on show. Look at the ducts on that. In truth, of course, it’s just another blunt restaurant unit on a less than lovely commercial street near Aldgate. Until last year it was home to a branch of Randy’s Wing Bar, which did what its name suggests. The people behind Randy’s decided the future at this outpost of their mini-empire lay not with wings, but with legs and claws. Put all those antecedents together and you could be forgiven for assuming this to be a grim, ersatz exercise in separating bored restaurant-goers from their money. It’s not. The food is terrific. Thought and care has gone into the tight menu. Whoever came up with the dishes knows how to feed and appears to be pretty damn fluent in the culinary vernacular of the southern US. There are oysters to start, both naked and dressed, perhaps with a smoked jalapeño salsa and a spritz of lime, or their own buffalo sauce and a dice of pickled celery. We have three of them grilled under a powerful buttery broth, flavoured enthusiastically with Worcestershire sauce, smoked paprika, cayenne, lemon and tarragon. Cooking oysters like this makes them only more explosively themselves: sweeter, plumper, saltier and deeply redolent of the sea they once called home. Alongside these, we have a couple of chunky king shrimp, split and accurately grilled with what they call “escargot butter”. Given that it would work just as well with snails as it does here, the title is a fair one. There’s garlic in there, and parsley and garlic and Pernod and garlic and a little lemon. And some garlic. Hence, the instruction to come here on your eighth date. You need to dine with someone you can breathe on later without embarrassment. At the heart of the menu are their hotpots: boisterous, Cajun-spiced broths, lightly thickened with the noble wonder that is the Louisiana roux, that gracious interplay of fat and flour cooked out together which underpins so much of this sort of food. The rust-coloured broth bobs with chunks of corn cob, red potato and smoked sausage, to which your chosen seafood is added. There’s mussels and shrimp in the New Orleans; crab claws and shrimp in the Alabama; and snow crab, clams and mussels for the Louisiana. A single serving of the New Orleans costs £21 or you can share for £35. The pricing works upwards from there. I have no idea what these regional titles have to do with the contents. Maybe they just wanted to prove they know the names of some places in America. There’s also a vegetarian version called the Mississippi, filled with butternut squash, grilled asparagus and okra, presumably aimed at non-meat eaters who really like hanging out with their pescatarian friends. What matters here is that they are huge, edible Fisher-Price Activity Centers for grownups. You are never alone with one of these hotpots: ooh, I can suck on this bit; ah, I can peel that bit; my, I can poke around in there for the sweetest of sweet white crabmeat. We have a side of their corn bread, which is ordered solely as a vehicle for a pot of their melted lobster butter. It is concentrated essence of lobster dissolved in hot butter, a fine union which deserves to be blessed and celebrated. We wanted a side of the steamed French beans, but they’d run out. So there’s nothing green on the menu tonight? Our waiter shrugged. He suggested we have the tempura vegetables. Deep-fried broccoli? We decide to get our vitamins from the potatoes and corn. Reader, we lived. At the end there was a serviceable sticky toffee pudding with a bourbon caramel. The New Orleans bread pudding, made with crisp layers of sugared croissant, was much more than serviceable. It was an airy, sweet and friable wonder, and a bargain at £5.50. I’ve made it clear that visiting Claw &amp; Hammer was a punt on my part. I loved the way the menu read online, but I had no expectation that this place, in this location, with these antecedents could deliver. I am delighted to say I was wrong. News bites It’s been a while coming, but finally it’s happening: Cardiff’s cult Japanese food outlet Matsudai Ramen, which made its name through hugely popular meal kits delivered nationwide during the pandemic, has finally acquired a permanent site.

Starters £4-£6, mains £8.50-£10, platters for two £30, desserts £5.50, wines from £20 Sugarcane London is a small, tidy Caribbean café on the Wandsworth Road serving, among other things, very good jerk chicken. The skin is crisped and blackened and has a sweet, aromatic warmth from an enthusiastic assault by a seasoning mix heavy with the wonder that is allspice. This is a restaurant review, so obviously we care about these things; the food matters and it will get its moment. But for now, there is another story that needs to be told: that of the man responsible for the jerk chicken and all the other deep, enfolding dishes coming out of the tiny open kitchen. I first heard about Tarell Mcintosh, self-styled as Chef Tee, courtesy of his neighbours. A few weeks ago, the restaurant was broken into. The shutters were wrecked, equipment and stock filched, the till emptied. Sugarcane London, one neighbour told me, had been a labour of love for Chef Tee, who had precious few resources when he started out and now had nothing. The local community, his neighbours and customers, crowdfunded the money he needed to get the place back on its feet. We talk earnestly about the importance of neighbourhood restaurants. We talk about their significance to communities. But this suggested a next level kind of love: a next level kind of importance. With good reason. As Chef Tee explained in the press release he put out in 2020 when the restaurant first opened (and which, to my shame, I completely missed), he grew up in care and wanted to do something for other care leavers. He is now 27, but has packed a lot into that short life: a bunch of degrees and time as a teacher, alongside jobs at restaurants such as Negril and Blues Kitchen in Brixton. He loved working and reworking Jamaican recipes at home, but by the point the pandemic arrived had decided to retrain in midwifery. Then one morning, during a head-clearing lockdown walk, he came across what had once been a corner shop, but was now empty. He convinced the landlord to give him the lease. He bought secondhand kitchen equipment that would just about do the job. He painted the signage himself because he didn’t have the money to get anyone else to do it, and nailed together the frame of a beach shack within the shop. There are wooden struts painted red and blue, and colourful sheets of corrugated iron playing the part of sloping roofs. There are wooden tables and chairs. Within a few weeks he had enough money to employ four care leavers. As he wrote, “I’m a helper, a changer, and this is what Sugarcane London is about. I am trying to use my company as a vessel for others.” Accordingly, the words “become a part of our story” are painted in his own hand across the front. I thought I would, not just by reporting the gloomy break-in news, or the better fable of the crowdfunder, but by eating there. Because that story starts to wobble if the food doesn’t stand up to examination. It really does. This is Chef Tee’s gentle journey around the islands. From Trinidad comes soft, flaky roti with a deep, sweet and sticky spiced gravy for dunking into and, as ever, if no one is looking, a little light sippage. Although, even if they were looking, no one would really care. It’s not that kind of place. Sip away. Alongside the half jerk chicken for £9, we have the jerk ribs, which have been braised until ready to leave the bone they called home, appropriately drenched in a sweet, hot glaze. Ask for more napkins. We have the curry goat, apparently “cooked in the Dutch pot for four hours the way my nan taught me”. His nan taught him well. There is a fiery power to the gravy, which makes my scalp sweat, and lots of bones to be nibbled clean. The same would be true of the 24-hour slow-braised oxtail, full of fresh spinach leaves now wilting gently in the heat, except that the meat has all but fallen away to make the deepest of stews. I suck at the bones anyway. There is jerk rice and a big bowl of kale and callaloo, to make sure you’ve eaten your greens. This is all comfort food, made by someone who knows a bit about having to find a place of safety and now wants to offer you one, too. We try their cocktails: a Dark ’n’ Stormy for £6.50, and something the colour of candy canes made with pink gin and pink Ting for Valentine’s Day. Both display a generous approach to measures. Mind you, if a little light inebriation is desired, you could miss out the cocktail list and head straight for dessert, which includes a section entitled “Alcohol-soaked cakes”. The ineffably light and crumbly chocolate cake comes doused in almond liqueur. On the side is a pot of their own custard, containing a depth charge of dark rum. Or there’s the bread-and-butter pudding with more dark rum. Chef Tee likes rum. At the bottom of the menu, it says, “No service is added to your bill so please tip so I can buy my staff rum.” Tonight, he says, is one of the first times the kitchen has handled service without him while he works the tables. “They’ve done a terrific job.” They’ve earned both their rum and their tips. Chef Tee is a gentle but charismatic figure, who somehow manages the important business of showing the love to his regulars while getting the dishes out and servicing the delivery drivers who turn up at the door. We fall to talking; there is no space in a small, intimate room like this for any pretence. He knows why I am here and I make it clear how well we have been fed. Chef Tee admits that from the very dark moment in the immediate aftermath of the break-in, business is now good; support from the community has been amazing. I tell him what he has done has been equally amazing. He nods gently and, without any side, says simply, “I’m a care leaver from a disadvantaged background. I’m black and gay, one of the youngest restaurateurs in the country who opened his restaurant during the pandemic by himself with just £3,000. I should be a statistic. Instead, I’ve broken the narrative and the barriers. Despite everything against me, I’m still standing.” In a space this small everyone can hear our conversation. Spontaneously, his customers give him a round of applause. Quite right, too. Jay’s news bites The Creameries in Chorlton, Greater Manchester, has a new identity. Founding chef Mary-Ellen McTague has handed the restaurant over to her head chef Mike Thomas, who has relaunched it as a southern European restaurant called Campagna at the Creameries.

Nearly 50% of respondents said they expected menu price increases of over 10% in 2022, with 15% of them anticipating a rise of more than 20%. Flor, the restaurant and then bakery opened in London’s Borough Market by James Lowe and John Ogier of Lyle’s in 2019, has ceased trading. Flor was backed by restaurant group JKS which retains the site. They have announced it will now become a second outpost of the Iranian kebab-focused restaurant Berenjak. At berenjaklondon.com.

This is reasonable: during an enthusiastically invasive PCR test in the back room of a Madeiran chemist earlier this month, it struck me that it might have been far easier to stay in Britain. In the Lakes, maybe, where, yes, it may well pelt with rain throughout August, but you can at least get there quickly without entering an MC Escher hellscape of contradictory pre-flight government websites. You can also leave easily, too – after a nice scone and a look at Todd Crag – and without paying some private medical charlatan £70 for the “purchase code” for a “day two landing test”, which you post off and they sling in a hedge. We are fortunate that the British Isles are so beautiful and varied, because only the very determined are leaving on a jet plane right now. Ambleside is particularly charming, because it’s a hodge-podge of cosy cafes, country pubs, climbing walls and art galleries, as well as home to roughly 86 places where you can buy Romney’s mint cake and quick-lock anti-shock trekking poles to take home and use on Clapham Common. If you asked the locals to recommend a fancy, special-occasion dinner, they’d probably say The Old Stamp House, which is Michelin-starred and serves plates inspired by Cumbria’s heritage and produce. Just a glance at the “our inspiration” section on its pretty website makes a Cumbrian such as myself go misty-eyed over its talk of the ports of Maryport and Whitehaven, of pepper bread and apple tansy from Westmoreland, and of Grasmere gingerbread, cumberland sausage and brown shrimp from the Solway. It will make you misty-eyed, too, though for different reasons, when you call up for a reservation and find that the place is completely booked up. But never fear, because Kysty is The Old Stamp House’s little sister, and it’s also run by chef Ryan Blackburn and his talented team. Kysty is apparently the more relaxed, casual version of its mothership, which it is and it isn’t. Kysty, a Cumbrian word for fussy, is still fairly, well, fussy – but beautifully so. We visited on a Wednesday lunchtime in early summer, when head chef Dan Hopkins’ brief set menu, at a tempting £27.50 for three courses, featured starters of Cumbrian pork belly with apple, dashi glaze and caviar and a delicate, utterly gorgeous velouté of spiced cauliflower with Morecambe Bay shrimps and saffron oil. Portions are brief, ornately arranged and memorable, and served with knowledgable aplomb by some of the finest front of house in the Lakes. So much so, it’s almost like it’s fine dining. I adore it when Michelin-starred chefs say they’re doing something “relaxed”, because they’re the least relaxed individuals ever. If you doubt me, try strolling into their kitchen and moving the pop’n’lock containers on their work stations even 12mm to the left: super-chill, groovy and hey, let’s go with the flow are rarely in the vocabulary of anyone at the annual Michelin awards. Another fine starter of Wye Valley asparagus was plated in a regimented line and littered with shaved parmesan, rich egg yolk and tastefully strewn edible petals. Bread was fresh and warm, delivered after intriguing amuse-bouches of savoury pink macaroons and a peculiar but tasty perfect cube of warm cheese with shaved beetroot, which wasn’t remotely slapdash. What I’m saying is, Kysty is a destination in its own right, so elbow your way in, even if it means having to be bolshie, because Margo from Tunbridge Wells has abandoned going to Tuscany this year and can’t get a table at the nearby Lake Road Kitchen, The Yan or Wabi Sabi, either. Weeks after my visit, I still think fondly of my main course of perfectly judged Arctic char on an intricate plinth of heritage tomatoes, wild garlic, hispi cabbage and beurre rouge. Charles’ guinea fowl breast main course, meanwhile, was easily the most generous serving of the whole meal, and came with a slice of baked aubergine, spiced carrot and a fine, crisp sesame tuile. The word “tuile” usually provokes a sort of Pavlovian reaction in me, because I immediately rictus-grin to soothe a panicked MasterChef contestant clutching one that resembles a vulcanised rich tea biscuit. At Kysty, though, it was plain sailing. Pudding was an elegant chunk of chocolate delice with macerated strawberries, strawberry sorbet and white chocolate ganache. There was a gingerbread cheesecake that sounded absolutely delightful, and I still regret not ordering it. As Tennyson almost said, “It is better to have eaten too much cheesecake and felt bilious than never to have ordered cheesecake at all.” Kysty is a small, classy, imaginative, relatively inexpensive, self-effacing jewel in the Lake District’s crown. It’s a good job we’re so good at restaurants in this country, because leaving isn’t easy. • Kysty 3/4 Cheapside, Ambleside, Cumbria LA22 0AB, 015394 33647.

Small plates £4-£13, desserts £7-£8, wines from £21 English seaside towns off-season are often said to be romantic places of sweet desolation and benign neglect. There is nothing romantic about Worthing today. Instead, my relationship with the town feels hotly dysfunctional, like it’s strapped me to the wall bars and is calling me filthy names. A wolf of a gale attempts to strip the clothes off my back, the rain slaps me about the chops and, beyond the beach, an angry sea seems to merge with a sky the colour of the bags beneath my eyes after too many late nights. I came to Worthing for lunch; instead, I am now seeking refuge. I find it courtesy of a handsome wood and glass pavilion with the kind of sturdy bifold doors that the middle classes perv over when they’re getting their kitchens done. I know this because I am that perv. I’ve got those doors. The restaurant is tucked in among sharp new apartment blocks and looks out defiantly at the wind-blasted Channel. Once in here we feel as if we have become spectators on the elements, rather than its victims. It is a good place to be. Bayside Social is the second restaurant from 2018 amateur MasterChef winner Kenny Tutt, a former banker who ran away to join the circus. He has clearly decided just one ring won’t do. The online menu at his first place, Pitch, located further into his home town, is a grown-up affair offering confited salmon with aerated hollandaise for £10 and local venison with pommes Anna for £22. It is clearly a serious restaurant; the sort an amateur changing career to become a professional uses to make a statement of intent. This new venture, which opened last September, is the confident, relaxed second child of a team that now knows what it’s doing. This sort of multifunctional operation, which has to be many things to many people at many different times of day, is harder to pull off than a traditional restaurant. It’s all about flexibility. Ahead of my visit, for example, I become mildly obsessed with browsing the breakfast menu: the shakshuka baked eggs for £8, the full English with its “old English breed” sausages, the three ways with eggs benedict and the option to add Ramsay black pudding or “homestyle” potatoes. I probably would add potatoes to my breakfast. That feels like me. The general all-day menu is a modish parade of small plates priced at between £6 and £8. Only the few dishes involving showy ingredients, like scallops and beef, nudge into double figures. Outside the weather is a cacophony of blues and gunmetal greys; inside it is all riotous colour and wake-me-up flavours. The menu is pleasingly fish-heavy, as it should be this close to the sea. After all, if the doors were open you could lob a Riedel glass from your table and get it in the surf. A greaseless stack of white fish tempura, so vaguely named because the fish involved might change depending on the available catch, is today made with haddock. It’s bound in a bright yellow lacy batter. On the side is a cheerfully rough and ready tartare, which is exceptionally light on binding mayonnaise and big on all the chopped gherkins and capers. The fish cookery, as with almost everything we try, is on point. Slabs of salty smoked haddock arrive on a foamy hollandaise, and glazed with a toasted layer of tart cheddar. It is lunchtime, but it feels like the table has been invaded by a moment from an old-fashioned high tea. Then we’re off to the northern shores of the Med, courtesy of a piece of hake, the skin crisply roasted, the flesh pearly white, laid across a heap of a white bean cassoulet with salty nuggets of chorizo. There is a bowl of fat king prawns, so fresh they squeak a little beneath the teeth, in a steamy lake of garlic butter spiked with Aleppo chilli. On the side there is a hard crusted piece of olive-studded focaccia, which softens quickly in the deep swamp of melted dairy. They make their own sausages here. The cumin-spiked lamb merguez have a dense, sticky quality, and come on a mess of stewed chickpeas dressed with the ludicrously vivid pink of quick pickled onion ribbons. A small dollop of labneh, or strained yoghurt, helps lubricate everything. It is early in January and pigs in blankets are still on the menu. I order them out of some misplaced wistfulness. They come with an overly sweet Cumberland sauce that, in the oven heat, has started to set and attempts to glue my teeth together. I know I will be picking bits of this out of my molars all the way up the train line home. It really is the only thing I can find to quibble over. No worries. There is a plate of their crunchy and vivid long-stem broccoli in a miso dressing. This has the double benefit of making you feel like you are a good person who believes in the way of the vegetable, while also dislodging lumps of a cumberland sauce which has gone far beyond soft ball stage, and is now auditioning for a role as a denture adhesive. Florets of caramelised cauliflower rest on a thick purée of darkly roasted onion. Given my whine about the cumberland sauce, it is obtuse of me to complain now that the pear tarte tatin is a little light on caramel stickiness, but only people who are desperate to please, cleave to notions of consistency. I won’t ever be one of those. I am however very taken by a Black Forest Eton mess, the bright purple cream given acidic vigour from black cherry. It is big on meringue and there are squares of a cherry kirsch jelly. After all that has gone before we do not need to finish it. We finish it. At the end there is a deep, dark-roasted espresso with none of the acidic notes the young people seem to like these days. God is in the detail and the detail has been fully attended to. Looking about the room I can suddenly see how it will be in summer: all those doors thrown open to let in the light sea breezes and the breath of saline. It will be a place of louche afternoons and sunshine. For now, though, the afternoon light is draining away and the wind is still cracking its cheeks. We must step outside. To be honest, I’d much rather stay in here and just start all over again. News bites Chef Nathan Outlaw, who closed his flagship restaurant at the height of the pandemic and opened the more casual Outlaw’s New Road in Cornwall’s Port Isaac, is expanding. He and his wife Rachel have bought the Stargazy Inn, a well-known pub with rooms boasting great views out over the coast, also in Port Isaac. ‘I’ve been gazing at the property from our restaurant Outlaw’s New Road, just a stone’s throw away, dreaming that one day we could get our hands on this property,’ Outlaw told Cornwall Live. ‘And now we have the keys.’ At outlaws.co.uk. In other expansion news, KFC has announced plans to open 500 new restaurants across the UK, a massive expansion from its existing 900 outlets. A lot of the growth will, they say, be through the opening of drive-throughs. Because what this country really needs now is more fried chicken. A grateful nation rejoices. Visit kfc.co.uk. Friends and neighbours of Sugarcane, a Caribbean restaurant on the Wandsworth Road, south London, have launched a fundraiser after it was broken into two weeks ago.

Or Northumberland, for that matter. Many patches of the north, with the rural north-east being a particularly good example, feel like the Bermuda Triangle to southerners: mysterious, loosely defined and quite feasibly patrolled by monsters. To me, however, Hexham was subject of many a “nice drive out” from Carlisle in the 1980s, bumbling along B-roads towards this sedate market town with a grade I-listed abbey dating from AD674, several art galleries, plenty of places to eat stottie cake and a chance to learn about the Vindolanda fort on Hadrian’s Wall. As a child, I did not appreciate Hexham’s beauty, and longed instead to be taken to the Gateshead MetroCentre to eat at Spud-U-Like and peruse Athena for sepia posters of hunks shifting tyres. But recently I returned and stayed at The Beaumont hotel and ate in its very fine restaurant. If I’m very honest, not a single local will thank me for alerting you to this chic, recently renovated, 33-room, townhouse-style hotel with a bar that will serve you a decent apricot bellini or a cold bottle of petit chablis to enjoy on tables close to the abbey’s grounds, because, until now, The Beaumont has been largely Hexham’s secret. Perhaps I liked my Saturday night alone in Hexham so much because The Beaumont still retains an air of chipper, diligent, business-as-usual hospitality. It’s a mood that so many larger outfits have given up on right now, due to staff shortages, to can’t-be-arsedness and especially to irrational new post-Covid company policies that seem to be nothing more than budget-slashing masquerading as “keeping you safe”. A recent short stay in a Malmaison, for instance, felt much like being in a community-theatre Franz Kafka production, and explored similar themes of existential angst and alienation. Pull up a chair, friend, and let me bore you with observations about nice things we have lost in the plague that will never return. Will “freedom day” herald my own freedom from hotel receptionists demanding, at a 3pm check-in, that I order my exact breakfast for the following day, “because Covid” means chef cannot possibly stick on a round of toast without 18 hours’ written notice? The more I travel the new world in 2021, the more like Victoria Wood’s Kitty I become, trippy-trapping off the train from Cheadle with a list of petty grievances about scant supplies of UHT pots and missing custard creams. So I checked into The Beaumont, and they wondered if I’d like to book to eat, which I eschewed, because I rarely eat in any hotel I’m staying in. The food is always blah, isn’t it? Bored chefs serving club sandwiches with ready-salted crisp garnishes or a signature burger topped with pulled pork. No, I’d make other plans. Two hours later, I sheepishly walked into The Beaumont’s dining room with a pillow-creased face and asked if they could fit me in. Thank God they said yes. A menu appeared filled with surprising, imaginative, delicious-sounding things; a touch finickity, perhaps, but definitely on the right side of accessible. Starters included beetroot-cured salmon with sourdough and an apple and cucumber slaw, as well as a beef tartare with beef fat and an egg yolk. I’ll just have a starter, I told myself, being a small, fey woman who eats like a bird, so I ordered the mackerel with gooseberry and samphire – three of my favourite things on one plate. Never, in the roughly 347 times I’ve been served mackerel on MasterChef, has anyone done it so well: the skin was beautifully charred, the flesh moist and salty, all littered with tiny sweet halves of gooseberry and sat atop a generous mound of buttered samphire. “This is incredible,” I said to myself, and promptly asked for the menu back. Well, it felt only sane to order a main course now. A deceptively simple-sounding plate of chicken stuffed with artichoke came with yet more artichoke of the Jerusalem variety, a scattering of hazelnuts and nasturtium flowers, and some delightfully rich pommes puree. I used to fear eating alone, but I have of late realised that it can provide the greatest, most life-affirming of times: a good menu, a large glass of cold viognier and, if need be, some flickering, low-level gossip on the family WhatsApp by way of entertainment. There’s a unique joy in ordering plates of lovely things all for yourself while other tables come and go and provide constant earwigging material. Staff always seem a little warmer when I’m alone, usually staying a fraction longer for a wee chat. Solo dinners always linger longer in my mind, possibly because I was absolutely present. For research purposes, I finished with a black sesame peach frangipane, which was more unusual and delicate than rib-stickingly moreish, but I’ve not seen its like anywhere before. And that is the point: there is a hotel dining room up in Hexham that’s producing intriguing, well-judged, wholly devourable food for which I’d happily travel from London again. I cherish every moment right now when the combination of good food, cold wine and warm hospitality makes me forget the endless moments of “because Covid”. So far in 2021, The Beaumont is in my top three. • The Beaumont Beaumont Street, Hexham, Northumberland NE46 3LT, 01434 602331. Open all week, lunch noon-3pm, dinner 5-8.30pm (last orders).

Are these, I wonder, optimum conditions to appreciate delicate stone bass sashimi by some of the north-west’s top restaurateurs? It’s Friday night in the repurposed general post office building, which is now a large, bustling food hall featuring many vendors, different cuisines and communal eating. Each of these halls across Britain has its own rules and quirks, and the GPO is one of the better, sleeker operations, because it allows table-booking and ordering by app, and also employs lots of affable, prompt staff to whisk plates of Jailbird’s Nashville-style fried chicken and Ferrero Rocher sundaes to your booth. There’s also Carousel Cheese, which serves baron bigod, sparkenhoe blue and yorkshire fettle (yes, that’s a feta-like cheese from North Yorkshire) Yo! Sushi-style. The bar is lively with what are called in news-speak “numerous revellers”, as well as that six-piece, brass-parping, stilt-walking gang who thunder their way through Nena’s 99 Red Balloons as my sumac and za’atar halloumi fries turn up from MorMor, one of the GPO’s Levantine-influenced traders. Liverpool is never dull – I knew that already – but this is the first time I’ve been offered an edible helium balloon while waiting for a plate of Sicilian red shrimp sashimi. That said, Nama taking root in the GPO is surprising to me, but then we do live in interesting times. This kiosk, which specialises in raw salmon, wagyu, yellowfin tuna and other small plate offerings, is the baby of Luke French and Stacey Sherwood-French, who own Sheffield’s Jöro, an elegant, modern Michelin Bib Gourmand holder made entirely of shipping containers. Jöro serves Highland wagyu knuckle with wasabi mustard and squab with fermented blackcurrant; after dinner, you can stay the night in one of their four boutique hotel rooms at House of Jöro, to rest your distended belly, enjoy its botanical toiletries and hand-tufted pillow tops and peruse the carefully strewn copies of The Noma Guide to Fermentation and Heston Blumenthal’s Fat Duck cookbook. I can’t think of many better mini-breaks in this country for the ardent food fan. After Jöro’s success, a casual dining Scandi-Japanese spin-off called Konjö appeared in Sheffield’s own food hall, the Cutlery Works. And now both it and Nama are here in Liverpool, with the latter looking from a distance more like a Morrisons fish counter than an izakaya-inspired restaurant. Still, something about the mood of ornate, Japanese-inspired, small plates was possibly lost by the time my yellowfin tartare cured in koji-soy oil with koshihikari rice, salmon roe, egg yolk, chives and furikake arrived 45 minutes after I’d ordered it on the app, and during you-know-who’s spirited rendition of Corona’s Rhythm of the Night. Ah yes, the rhythm of the night. I need to ask a very honest question here: are food halls ever a truly satisfying dining experience? I’ve no doubt they seem so on paper and in the marketing meetings, they’re fantastic for filling old, unloved but historically important spaces and they’re good news for downward-spiralling city centres. Yet in reality they’re noisy, unrelaxing and the food is often patchy, with the occasional gem hidden among the colossal choice of menus. While waiting for Nama’s Cornish stone bass, which came abundantly titivated with truffle, lemongrass, yuzu, ponzu, English wasabi and nori, we picked at Konjö’s Korean-style cauliflower, which was squishily soft and claggy, and came with an almost inedible, one-note chilli jam. How could this basket of mush possibly have any connection to Jöro in Sheffield? Konjö’s Korean chicken was simply more of the same abrasive taste. By far the loveliest thing I ate that evening were those Sicilian prawns: light, sweet and ever so slightly fiery, with a lime, ginger, ponzu and jalapeño dressing. But, to tell the truth, several of the dishes we grazed on at the GPO, across the many vendors, were not quite wonderful, the overplay of raw red onion and lack of heat or herb at MorMor being especially noteworthy. What the GPO lacks in deliciousness, however, it makes up for at 9pm on a Friday in atmospheric oomph and hi-octane 1990s house covers, plus the majestic sight of full-glam Liverpool ladies in the bar area setting off on a night on the tiles, which, as a north-western woman myself, will always make my heart soar. As a meeting spot, drinking hole or place to eat chicken on waffles, the GPO is a definite success, but as a centre of culinary excellence, I’d be more likely to return to Duke Street Market, where you can get a more comfortable, sit-down experience. It wasn’t by any means a good evening for a food fan, but it’s safe to say that Friday-night Liverpool is still absolutely thriving. • Nama The GPO, Metquarter, 35 Whitechapel, Liverpool L1.

As erections go, it is remarkable. Look out for the multitude of white faux-fur rugs draped over terrace chairs, the twinkling amber lights, the DJ booth and the après-ski vibes. Or the après-retail therapy vibes, because Haugen is a Las Vegas version of a Gstaad mountain lodge that’s been hammered up outside Westfield Stratford on the main drag to West Ham’s football stadium. The ground floor cafe-bistro serves breakfast from 8am and then fondue and schnitzel until around 10pm. The rooftop bar offers ski-themed cocktails such as the Saint Bernard and the Black Diamond. A more formal, pricier restaurant will open on one the upper floors in due course. Haugen is colossal, shimmering and jaw-dropping. To give an idea of scale, the private booking info claims it has potential for “exclusive events of up to one thousand”. That is a whole lot of yodelling and melted gruyere. On the West Ham match day I ate there, all the restaurants in and around the Westfield shopping centre – Busaba, Wahaca, The Real Greek and so on – were protected by barriers. Security guards and police routed the football crowds away from anything smashable, with Haugen being closely guarded. Whether similar measures will be in place come spring 2022, when the nearby Abba Arena opens, is unclear. How rowdy are Abba fans? Will the £200 tickets to watch holograms cavort to Dancing Queen leave any spare cash for raclette, Berner würstel and tartiflette? The one fact I do know is that Haugen is the humongous, ski-lodge-themed, multi-use, schweinshaxe- and black-forest-gateau-serving leisure space that literally not one diner was crying out for, but it’s here now and, frankly, I’m fixated. On my first attempt to eat here, I sat for 25 minutes being ignored while legions of staff floated rudderless and unmanaged. I left without eating, but felt rather bad afterwards. Here, I thought, is yet another post-pandemic, post-Brexit gargantuan restaurant project setting sail, whether or not the staff are trained, and I should learn to accept the new chaotic normal. The second time, Haugen had clearly got wind of my appointment and the brightest and best staff were on hand; the emmental and appenzeller were quickly on the melt and my fondue appeared with great alacrity. Haugen could be rather lovely in a kitsch, take your friends for a laugh kind of way, but what’s sabotaging it presently is the quality of its produce. A “classic” mountain fondue is for a minimum of two people at £22.50 per head. Admittedly, the heralding at the table of the bubbling caquelon of melty cheese with requisite long-prong forks is a fun moment, but then one surveys the things to dip into the goo: biteless, cheap silverskin onions; forgettable, unseasoned, steamed new potatoes; an unlovable plate of poor-quality speck, coppa and stale cornichons; a large plate of stale bread. Of course, many will argue that the bread is supposed to be stale, but, at £45, this began to feel like an assault. Fondue is purposefully simple: it is dipping miscellaneous things in communal cheese, mainly for sociable purposes. However, those items should be excellent. In the past, I’ve eaten showstopping fondue with crisp radishes, pickled vegetables and delicious hunks of crusty bread that left people fighting for the final cheesy smear. A starter of grilled autumn squash consisted, quite hysterically, of one diminutive slice of squash hiding among a vast plate of rocket leaves, like Martin Sheen in Apocalypse Now. A portion of Severn &amp; Wye smoked trout was smaller than my palm, and arranged in two pieces; it was dry and arrived with an egg cup full of quite good celeriac remoulade for £12.50. Haugen’s semi-open kitchen is evidently busy, with several chefs arranging food on plates, but they are utterly hampered by someone’s desperate need to make profit. Nothing felt or tasted as if it has been made from scratch. We ordered two cakes for dessert: a slice of sachertorte – a chocolate marzipan cake – which was pleasant enough, albeit clearly mass-produced, and at least looked appealingly glossy in Instagram photographs (phew, thank heavens); and an allegedly twice-baked cheesecake that tasted vaguely of vanilla and came with a small pot of purple compote that may have been blackberry but was actually blueberry. As is the case with many of these huge, tourist-magnet restaurants, Haugen relies on a one-time clientele who will be bedazzled by the decor and unquestioning of the menu’s prices and provenance. This pains me. There is fresher, better grab-and-go food in the M&amp;S food hall a short walk way, even if you do have to eat it on the wall outside the Holiday Inn.

The Maine, newly opened in Mayfair, central London, describes itself as a “blend of old-world British elegance, New England extravagance and subterranean decadence”. I know: I’m exhausted already, too. Yet, having spent a Saturday lunchtime in this hectic, multi-floored pleasure palace, there are definitely bones of truth among the balderdash. What is more extravagant than taking over a Grade II-listed Georgian building on the west side of Hanover Square and turning it into a gargantuan party venue with seating for 350? If you passed this former residence of the Duke of Montrose during a sightseeing jaunt, you’d certainly be struck by the house’s elegant, imposing frontage, because this is how London looks in a souvenir snowglobe. And now Canadian restaurateur Joey Ghazal has created a vast, dark, twinkling brasserie restaurant/nightclub in its basement, where one could easily imagine Dita Von Teese swirling about in a giant martini glass and where, I’m told, there’s a VIP room through a hole in the bathroom wall. There’s also a “Tavern”, with brick alcoves extravagantly furnished in red leather and, on the ground floor, a Georgian-styled “Drawing Room” that makes you feel a bit like you’re on the set of the Netflix drama Bridgerton, or maybe a Las Vegas hotel called The King George. It’s got an olde-worlde feeling, sure, and a strong synthetic aftertaste, though that might have just been my soft-baked cookie dessert (a similar one is available at Pizza Hut) or the large, rather sloppy “crispy fish taco” in pico de gallo and hot sauce – but more of the food in a moment. More pressingly, much of the drawing room’s seating plan forces couples to sit side by side, as if they’re riding a dodgem, meaning the pair of you end up glaring out at the other diners. Some restaurateurs seem to think this layout is romantic, but it’s just a recipe for a cricked neck and tipping gravy into your companion’s crotch. The Maine’s menu is riddled with New England flavours served in the international language of the soulless private members’ club. There are lobster rolls, clam chowder, chargrilled octopus and soft-shell crab with lime aïoli; oysters come numerous ways; and chicken paillard sits alongside the apparently now obligatory dover sole meuniere. The room filled up quickly with rubber-neckers checking every table lest Tom Cruise had popped in for some ceviche, but by 12.30pm much was already missing from the menu, while there seemed to be a near-compulsory tour of the building being visited on the diners between courses. Lunch began with a complimentary warm, but not especially fresh, baguette with a whole bulb of rather bitter roast garlic and a plate of sliced, good-quality beef tomato with plenty of black pepper. We ordered two types of tacos from the hot starters menu: the aforementioned “crispy” fish and cauliflower in a tahini dressing that turned out to be a lot of rather tasteless beans and sweetcorn. These tacos are simply best avoided; no happiness can be found here. The lobster roll was a forlorn-looking dry brioche filled not overly generously with lobster meat and lettuce, and came with inedible crisps . If I’m honest, by this stage my hopes for the rest of lunch were not high. Sometimes, you just get a feeling. The staff are a heady mix of inexperienced, hyper-confident and assertive, doling out history lessons on the postcode, stopping you mid-order to suggest their own ideas on where you’re going wrong and, excitingly, setting tests throughout the meal to name the dishes you’ve enjoyed so far. Spoiler: not really any of them. I ordered a slice of key lime pie, and somehow ended up with that soft baked cookie due to the ebulliently cheerful over-selling. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise, because the meringue on the pie was both sloppy and gritty. My companion and I shared its alternative: some warm dough in a bowl with a jug of extra pouring chocolate. “This is the best thing I’ve eaten since I got here,” I declared while mopping up the chocolate sauce that one of the waiters had insisted on pouring over it – and the table – before leaving, never to return. Without any booze, we left about £100 lighter and still hungry. The Maine will be a roaring success, however, because it is ostentatious, starry, looks fabulous in photographs and the clientele who will keep it afloat aren’t really interested in eating. It’s so faux-posh that Nicky Haslam has probably already added it to his things that are common list. There are many, many people who will love it, but as Sartre wrote in No Exit: “Hell is other people”. • The Maine Mayfair 6 Medici Court, 20 Hanover Square, London W1, 020-3432 2192.

One need only look at any recent political sexy digression to know instinctively that booze, and booze goggles, were involved. Of course, nothing is normal right now, so the brand spanking new Blue Boar Pub, which is about a 10-minute walk from the House of Commons, was peacefully sedate on the midweek lunchtime I visited. The Blue Boar markets itself as “a sophisticated and modern take on a classic English pub” that sells Meantime pale ale and albariño by the glass, alongside fish and chips, scotch eggs, posh pork scratchings and so on, all overseen by the incredibly accomplished chef Sally Abé. I understand the need for the Blue Boar to set out its stall as an “English pub” to entice foreign tourists and residents of the Conrad St James hotel, to which it is attached, but the truth is there are British theme pubs on cruise ships that offer more of a sense of a slightly shabby UK boozer. The Blue Boar, on the other hand, is a slick, pristine space with plush carpets, wine buckets, dozens of padded leather chairs, besuited bartenders and warm, knowledgable staff. Anyone who has ever killed time in one of the many semi-neglected London pubs on the street corners of Fitzrovia, Soho and the South Bank knows that this level of pomp is not typical. In fact, anyone entering a pub on, say, Oxford Street expecting to order a cold, hard Tommy’s margarita or a sumptuous plate of Wye Valley asparagus with smoked creme fraiche dressing may find themselves disappointed. Still, if one ignores, or indeed relishes, the fact that the Blue Boar is not really a pub at all, but a casual restaurant helmed by a hugely respected chef, then there’s a lot to like about this venture. It’s bright, airy, spotless and quite jolly, as if an eccentric American billionaire had spotted a Wetherspoons in Blackpool and flapped his arms around shouting, “Yes, I want this, but make it very, very expensive and bring me a chef who has worked at The Ledbury, Elystan Street and the Harwood Arms to make devilled whitebait and burgers!” (Abé, incidentally, is also running a more formal, fine-dining restaurant called The Pem in the same hotel, which I plan to eat at soon.) I ate at the Blue Boar with my friend Hugh, who helped me range across the menu with a few cold glasses of gavi di gavi. We were placed on a table for two in the window area that overlooks the street, but there are snugger, cosier tables on offer should you be going over some late paperwork with a lithe special adviser. We began with the bar snacks section, and some really very good coronation chicken scotch eggs – warm, crisply breadcrumbed, runny yolks – that were served with a golden raisin chutney. Delicious. Whitebait were large, semi-soggy beasts, but we demolished them anyway. And pork scratchings were those modern, air-light, large Quaver affairs, rather than the old-school, hairy, scabby ones that haunt many of our nightmares from childhood, and came with a sweet, bramley apple dipping sauce. For starters, we shared a slice of good Montgomery cheddar, leek and smoked ham quiche. Never before have I mentioned quiche in a restaurant column. It has disappeared from our restaurant menus, which is a shame, because when it’s made like this, there’s nothing quite like it, although it always makes me think back to when quiche lorraine first arrived in 1970s Carlisle with a hand-written name tag in the cake shop window, and word quickly spread down my street that it was pronounced “Quwinkie”. The London particular soup is the starter to go for if you’re hoping to impress your Instagram followers: it is a strikingly vivid green garden pea soup with a poached hen’s egg and herb focaccia. For main, I chose one of the Blue Boar’s many vegetarian and vegan options – they’re very good like that – namely, the lentil shepherd’s pie with a side of purple sprouting broccoli. It was the hottest day of the year and the backs of my knees were clammy, but I couldn’t say no to a shepherd’s pie, especially one that came with a jug of rich, black garlic gravy. The market fish of the day was lemon sole, which arrived under-seasoned and with a rather anonymous lemon, parsley and caper butter. We passed on puddings because nothing on the menu – buttermilk pannacotta with strawberries, earl grey chocolate mousse or apple tart – leaped out at us as irresistible. If some truly British rib-sticker such as spotted dick or jam roly-poly had been on offer, I’d have fully committed myself to the cause, but instead we finished the gavi and tottered back out into the sunlight. I’m unsure whether I’d go back to the Blue Boar to eat, but it’s a useful place to keep up your sleeve for a drink and a quick bite of something close to the Westminster village. Alternatively, if you’re not in the mood for politicians right now, at least you know where the buggers are drinking. • Blue Boar Pub 45 Tothill Street, London SW1, 020-3301 8080.

I’ve wanted to shout about this award-winning gastropub ever since I stopped by a month or so ago, curious as to why food folk speak about it in hallowed tones. The Compasses, it transpires, is tucked away in a sort of bucolic dreamworld about eight miles outside Ashford, where the A28 suddenly veers into twisty, squeakishly narrow lanes bedecked with overgrown hedges, hay bales, rugged barns, ivy trails and other things commonly found in hobbit stronghold the Shire. The Compasses also has a large beer garden, although it feels churlish to call it that, because it’s more like a neatly cropped meadow with a picture-perfect child’s swing hanging from an ancient tree. I sat in the garden in August, eating affogato with a delicate long spoon. This is one of my very favourite desserts, joyful in its simplicity, and also so much bang for your buck: just a scoop of very good vanilla ice-cream in a short glass with a shot of espresso and another shot of a liqueur of your choice; I chose Tia Maria because, well, classy is as classy does. We’d eaten our starters and mains inside the handsome, old-fashioned pub, but pudding was delivered on a tray to a spot on the lawn where we’d been escorted for our final course. Our transfer hither and thither was efficiently managed – nobody forgot us during the changeover, and no balls were dropped between the front of house and kitchen as to what we needed next. This is not as common as you might think. Competent, flowing, magical service is a skill, and the biggest coup is making the trick seem as if it’s not even happening; that this loveliness is just life. That is hospitality. I wonder, considering the ongoing nationwide restaurant staffing crisis, how many have jumped ship after feeling unappreciated for so long, or because the sleight of hand required to make diners feel special is still not considered “a proper job”, or at least not in the UK. So, with all that in mind, I’m telling you about Rob and Donna Taylor at The Compasses despite the fact that – gasp! – after this weekend, they’re leaving Crundale for pastures new. Yes, they’re off – to Tunbridge Wells, in fact, where they’ll weave their magic all over again at a new site due to open at the start of November. This is music to my ears, because I’ve recently spent a fair amount of time in Tunbridge Wells and excellent dinner is not always readily available. So, yes, please, to some Compasses-style magic coming to town. Such as their thick, glossy wodges of home-baked seeded warm focaccia with glorious Marmite cream cheese to nibble on while you have a shufti at their wines by the glass, including a Puglian organic Zensa Fiano at just £3.90 a pop. For starters, Charles and I shared some deep-fried Winnies Wheel – like a camembert, but from Canterbury. These gooey-centred, crisp bullets came laced with petals of pickled grelot onion, parsley root and walnut ketchup. Another starter of Stour Valley quail featured the breasts and wings on a bed of plump, slightly softened Kentish cherries with pieces of rich black pudding. This is faffy, risk-taking cooking that would still appeal to a fussy eater so long as they didn’t read the menu descriptions too closely. Soused mackerel, for example, comes with pretty pink fir potatoes, shaved fennel and a chilled tomato liqueur. It’s fish, spuds and tomato sauce, but pulled off with aplomb. It would be a hard heart that didn’t love the Compasses’ roast roll of chicken with rosemary dumplings, which are more accurately wobbly, delicious, herby gnocchi, each one browned golden, then arranged on the plate with soft baby leek, truffle shavings and more truffle in the sauce. Charles’ treacle-cured beef and glazed ox cheek came with a braised baby gem leaf and English mustard clotted cream, a fabulously clever and decadent take on horseradish. I tried to steer us away from sides, but we also had dripping chips with truffle mayo and a heritage tomato salad with elderflower dressing. For vegetarians, a goat’s cheese roulade came with a smoked aubergine cream sauce and purple sprouting broccoli. This is one of those menus that makes you feel temporarily that everything is right with the world, and in that shady corner of the pub, at least, some sanity was restored to 2021. And that was before I even got stuck into the Tia Maria. I also noted with delight that Kahlúa, Amaretto and Frangelico were also on offer, because I adore any fancy menu that lists drinks more commonly found in the bottom of a school bag being transported skulduggerously from a parent’s drinks cabinet to a school disco, often with dire results. Wherever this team goes, I will follow. And if they keep making that Marmite cream cheese and serving roquefort with fresh brown butter financiers, I’ll be there with bells on. • The Compasses Inn Sole Street, Crundale, Kent, 01227 700300.

Starters £9.50-£12.50, mains £15.50-£32.50, platters £27.50-£49.50, desserts £6.95-£7.50, wines from £25 It starts badly; terribly, terribly badly. We order the calamari, a sizeable plateful at a sizeable price of £10.50. It is very much old school: a pile of those hefty rings of golden battered mature squid that the British came to associate with the sun-kissed exotica of 1980s Mediterranean holidays. Sangria, sunburn, the glamour of deep-fried calamari. I merely have to glance at them and soft waves of nostalgia wash over me. I can almost smell the Nivea After Sun. Now I bite in and what comes away with the meaty ring is a slippery spittle-thread of something sickly white and troubling. The squid hasn’t been de-membraned before being battered and deep-fried. It looks as if it’s producing dribbles that need to be wiped up with a tissue. It’s cack-handed and a terrible waste. The newly opened Seafood Bar on London’s Dean Street makes a lot of noise about the sustainability of its business in general and the ingredients it uses in particular. But there’s no point bigging up your ethics if you’re not going to attend to the essentials. Happily, it turns out to be an aberration, because we will eventually get to our main courses and they will be magnificent. They will more than make the case for the restaurant’s recent opening. Which is good, because I was beginning to wonder whether it had a hope in hell of surviving. The Seafood Bar is the first British outpost of a Dutch restaurant group, with four branches in the Netherlands. It occupies the home of what was once the Red Fort, a venerable Indian restaurant much beloved in its pomp by Labour party bigwigs because of the support given to their cause by its owner, Amin Ali. I had never clocked before just how big the Red Fort site was. Now it’s been stripped back and you can see everything. There’s white tiling and white slat-board frontages to the bar. There are flourishes of beige, if beige can flourish, courtesy of pale banquettes and blond-wood flooring. There’s also a little bare brick illuminated by outbreaks of neon signage. It looks like the decor has been done by a subsidiary of the White Company, in an attempt to break out from all the bed linen and towelling. For weeks I’ve been able to see all this through the huge front plateglass windows because, every time I’ve passed, it has seemed remarkably empty. As in, people kept remarking to me on its emptiness. The issue, I think, is knowing what the Seafood Bar is for, because all successful restaurants need a clear purpose. There’s the date-night place, and the special occasion place; the family supper place and the “can’t be bothered to cook” place. In Bentley’s, Scott’s and J Sheekey, London already has three big-ticket seafood gastro palaces. Close your eyes as you hand over the plastic and intone the mantra: “Good seafood should never be cheap.” Somewhere in the mid-market there’s Parsons and Bob’s Lobster, Oystermen and the various Wright Brothers. No, none of them are exactly cheap, but you will probably escape without flogging a kidney. So what of the Seafood Bar? What’s it for? After all, the menu includes a fruits de mer for two at £87.50. That puts it firmly in Sheekey territory, doesn’t it? This is where it gets interesting. It is most definitely about seafood platters for sharing. The thing is, the sharing might not quite be in the way the restaurant itself intended. I am aware that what I’m about to say might undermine their business model, but as this is what I’d tell a close friend, I really ought to tell you this, too. Their platters for one are enough to feed two. Let’s start with their “mixed grill from the plancha”. What they call a serving for one costs £35 and includes a huge king prawn, big fat shrimps and rings of (happily de-membraned) squid, a thick piece of salmon, a few slip sole fillets and a good-sized sea bass fillet. Oh, and half a lobster. All of this comes in a ripe tomato sauce at the bottom, and is dribbled in places with herb garlic butter. Finally, it is decorated with fronds of samphire. Get a bowl of their very good chips each and an awful lot of napkins, and you will both be sorted. It’s immense. Exactly the same applies with the fruits de mer. There is a version for one at £49.50, but if you’re willing to forgo the lobster, it costs £27.50. And again, there’s an awful lot for your money. There are mussels and razor clams, cockles and brown shrimps, periwinkles, prawns, clams and a langoustine. There’s a seafood salad plus rolls of smoked salmon, a hunk of brown crab, a seaweed salad and a couple of rock oysters. There’s a bowl of a Marie Rose sauce and another of a herb dip. There’s a whole lot of everything. You get the idea by now: a portion or two of chips, some salad and the job is done. Come here if you need to get into the nitty gritty of life with a close friend, or even just with a mere acquaintance. It is impossible to be formal with anyone when you are up to your armpits in shellfish debris. The menu has other things. There’s a sea bass ceviche, which is serviceable. As mentioned, they make a lot on their website about the sustainability of their ingredients including the salmon, Nordic Blu, which they say is the most sustainable farmed salmon in the world. If you care about this stuff, and you should, you can read all about it for yourself on their website. There are just two desserts: a multilayered chocolate mousse and a cheesecake. I take one look at them and know immediately they weren’t made here. Our chatty and knowledgable waiter confirms this. Don’t let those detain you. You’re in Soho. The great Maison Bertaux, which has been doing its fabulous cream cake and patisserie thing since 1871, is only over on Greek Street. Just at the bottom of Dean Street is Maître Choux, for some seriously impressive chocolate eclair and choux bun action. You have better choices. But do come for those seafood platters. I will simply have to keep my fingers crossed that they don’t now rethink their portion sizes and prices as a result of what I’ve said. Because what they’re offering deserves a good crowd. News bites Chef Niall Keating of the multi-starred Whatley Manor in Wiltshire is overseeing the menu at a new restaurant launching next month in his home county of Staffordshire. Lunar will open on the site of Wedgwood in Barlaston near Stoke-on-Trent, and is named after the famed Lunar Society, part of the Midlands enlightenment, of which Josiah Wedgwood was a founding member. The Asian-inflected menu will feature small plates including scallop with citrus and preserved ginger, and tempura pumpkin with tamarind and chilli as well as sharing dishes like clay baked chicken with treasure rice.

Starters £8-£12, mains £9-£18, desserts £8-£9, wines from £25 I knew there was a point to my ludicrous hair. It’s this review. Because without my midlife crisis expressed through the medium of glossy tresses, I would not have been introduced to Fadiga. It describes itself as a “Ristorante Bolognese”, and occupies a tiny site on Berwick Street in London’s Soho. It’s located right next to where I go to be dealt with by the brilliant Filipe, a man who exudes quiet confidence in the face of great challenges. With immense forbearance he excavates something meaningful from the chaos of my endlessly explosive bouffant. While he does so, we talk: the usual stuff, which is to say the staggeringly intimate and profound subjects that any right-thinking person interrogates with their hairdresser. Regularly, he commiserates with me over brutally false allegations on social media that I’ve been dyeing my hair. For God’s sake people, look at my beard. Surely, I’d have dyed that, too, if I was trying to deceive. Once, with perfect mock solemnity, Filipe offered to issue an official statement confirming it was all model’s own. I still have him on standby for that. We also talk restaurants, which is why he mentioned the new place downstairs. It was odd. New restaurants need to hit the ground running to start making back the investment, so breathless news always pops up online. But of Fadiga, I had heard nothing. Once he’d done with me, and swept up enough from the floor to make a newly shorn sheep ache with jealousy, we went down to the street. We stood outside the narrow restaurant, side by side, and stared in through the big window at the cool, clean lines of the wood-floored 10-seater dining room, with its glass display case of freshly made pastas. Apparently, Filipe said, the chef was a bit “out there”. I found my way to the restaurant’s new-born Instagram account, which suggested this might well be so: here were images of candy-striped tortellini looking like humbugs and rhubarb and custard sweets. Here were ravioli in rainbow colours, or filled with blueberries or pear and goat’s cheese. It was both diverting and a touch worrying. Based on a lovely dinner there I can tell you this was all merely come-hither window dressing, though only of the electronic kind. The actual window dressing is courtesy of the ribbons of egg yolk-yellow tagliatelle they sometimes roll and cut on the wide marble sill hard against the real window. When we arrive for dinner, that marble slab is scattered with the promise of squid ink black tortellini. They are made, like all the pastas here, by Michela Pappi. The dishes are then cooked by her husband Enrico Fogli and served by their daughter Carlotta. In Bologna the family ran hotels, before coming to the UK four years ago to run a catering company. Now they have this restaurant, which carries the maiden name of Enrico’s late mother. Here’s what you need to know: that pasta, made daily, is bloody lovely, full of the requisite slipperiness and bite and tension. There are nine main dishes, all priced in the mid-teens, supplemented by a trio of specials. Despite the exuberance on display on Instagram (a lockdown project, Carlotta later tells me; her mum just got bored), it’s all comfortingly familiar. There is pappardelle with a wild mushroom sauce, or tagliolini with summer truffles. There are ricotta tortelli with tomato and basil, squid ink bucatini with seafood, and gnocchi in a butter and sage sauce. Portions are for those with ambitious appetites; if you ask, they will happily split a dish between two so you can try more. We have tagliatelle with their 12-hour ragu. It is everything the dish should be. The beef and pork in that meaty sauce have slumped down after all that languid time in each other’s company to become the richest and glossiest of stews, which cling to every ribbon of pasta. From the specials list there are those squid ink tortellini from the window, as black as an unlit night, as soft and silky as a duck down pillow, and filled with the bright white of filleted seabass. They come in a punchy mess of squid and mussels and the sweetest of cherry tomatoes just waiting to burst against the roof of your mouth. And then there is that classic: tortellini in brodo di cappone, the calming place where Italian mamas and Jewish mothers meet to realise their destiny as feeders. The clearest and most intense of chicken broths bobs with a generous serving of tiny curls of pasta filled with minced pork and parmesan. It is a steamy bowl you want to lean over and stare into; it is food as place of safety. I would be failing in my role as reporter if I left it there. Fadiga really is all about the fabulous pasta. There’s a very short list of starters and they are rugged, sturdy affairs. Alongside a plate of salami and ham, there’s an intensely northern Italian dish of crisp beef meatballs under a duvet of ham and cheese; there are scallops, grilled under thick drifts of buttery golden breadcrumbs. Both come with those cubed roasted potatoes to which the Italians cleave, slightly weirdly. Tonight there are just three desserts and one of those, a strawberry tiramisu, has run out. A new batch has just been made, we are told, but the cream hasn’t yet set. Instead, we have a mildly rigid coffee panna cotta and a zuppa inglese, that comedic take on the trifle, with layers of pink syrup-soaked sponge and cream and fruit. It is certainly pretty. At one point after the starters, we receive an apology for the lengthy wait and the offer of a drink on the house. I am baffled by the delay, given there are only four of us eating up here in this tiny dining room. It turns out that downstairs there is a large table of diners being taken through a pasta tasting menu. Oh, and the sous chef has gone missing. There is about it all the slightly nervy air of a new venture finding its feet, but in the sweetest and most beguiling of ways. Fadiga deserves all the love. Incidentally, it turns out that the shiny display case is not just for show. You can buy their pastas to take home. They cost from £1.50 per 100g for the simple ribbons, to £4.50 for the more luxuriously filled shapes. It means I can now get a masterful hair cut and sort out dinner at the same time. Result. Thank you, Filipe. Thank you, Fadiga.

Starters £7-£10, mains £9.50-£25, desserts £4.50-£6.50, wines from £24 Schnitzel Forever, a small restaurant in London’s Stoke Newington, is the cornerstone of a blossoming high street chain with many outposts across the country. It just doesn’t quite know it yet. This is not damning with faint praise. We are, of course, required to venerate the independent over the mass-produced and cookie-cutter, and we do. Even the very word “chain” makes people twitch. I realised recently that I substitute the word “group” to describe a restaurant brand with multiple outposts that I admire, so as not to smear it with the rancid stench of chain corporatism. But, in truth, the eight-strong Dishoom, which I like very much, is just a chain by any other name. And is not the ever-delightful steakmongers Hawksmoor, now with 12 outlets, also a chain? Over the years, brands like Piccolino (18 branches), Côte (more than 80) and Nando’s (3,207,565) have served me well. Many chains are, of course, where hope and ingredients go to die. Oh Frankie &amp; Benny’s, how do I loathe thee? Let me count the ways. And while I’m doing so, please give your overlong wipe-down menus a wipe. But some can be a reassuring presence on a blighted, blasted high street. The point is that I could well imagine those good ones being joined by a rolled-out version of Schnitzel Forever, the name of which tells you most of what you need to know. Right now, it is a small standalone restaurant serving flattened things, which have been bread-crumbed and fried. Crusty, golden, fried foods are, as we all know, the good foods. Schnitzel Forever is a total crowd-pleaser, only without the crowds. I should declare a mild interest here or perhaps, more accurately, a ludicrous, overblown obsession. In 2007, I published an endlessly brilliant novel called The Oyster House Siege, about a hostage situation in a restaurant kitchen on the night of the 1983 general election. Schnitzel provides a key plot point. In that case it’s a wiener holstein, a wiener schnitzel with the addition of a fried egg, anchovies and veal jus. The yolk and sauce lubricate the crisp fried veal; the anchovies add extra poke. I would hesitate to call it the very zenith of Mitteleuropean culinary achievement, but not for very long. In my novel the hostage-taker, knowing he has to make demands of the police negotiators, panics and reads off an ingredient list from a sheet taped to the wall. A policeman, who is also a keen cook, spots he’s left off the anchovies, adds them to the order and so a dialogue develops. I have no idea why this book has not yet been turned into a major motion picture, perhaps starring Christopher Walken as the schnitzel. The movie rights remain available. Pretty much the only iteration of the dish missing from the menu at Schnitzel Forever is, as it happens, wiener holstein. I’ll let it pass as it’s my obsession, not theirs (Fischer’s in London’s Marylebone does a very good one.) What matters is that they have nailed the essential business of taking various ingredients – chicken, pork, veal and so on – beating them flat, breading and then frying them. They are bronzed and crisp and at £10 to £13 for the basic, which completely covers the plate, very well priced. There is also a halloumi schnitzel, a portobello mushroom schnitzel and something involving seabass. All dietaries are catered for. In the “specials” section, priced in the higher teens, the plate-coverer becomes a raft for additional ingredients. The classic wiener schnitzel, made as it should be with veal, comes heaped with a seriously vinegared potato salad, alongside a jug of rich, sticky demi-glace. The “cordon bleu” has emmental, ham and mash. With the “el granjero”, it’s crushed avocado, jalapeño pickles, lime and more demi-glace. Or you can adorn your own by the application of punchy sauces and relishes. I especially liked the bloody mary ketchup and the apple and cider brandy chutney. The availability of a curry sauce enables them to include a menu item called a katsu schnitzel, which will drive some of my friends to thoughts of violence. In this instance I am merely the reporter. Naturally enough, breaded fried things enjoy being shoved inside a brioche bun and being called a burger. For £12.50, you can have a tower schnitzel burger with a triple decker of veal, pork and chicken. The point here is that a single, compelling idea has been saddled up and ridden about as far into the sunset as it can possibly go. There is a very good, zippy white cabbage coleslaw for £5, although I would love to stop the kitchen adding soured cream to the cucumber salad. It makes what should be a crisp bright foil to the fried goods, weirdly cloying. Hilariously, the commitment to breading and frying things extends into the starters, where both squid and tiger prawns receive the same treatment. In keeping with their readiness for high street ubiquity, the disappointing desserts are generally over-sugary spongey items – a double chocolate brownie, a sticky toffee pudding – most of which are bought in from elsewhere. Apparently, they do make their own apple strudel but it’s off the night we are there. Like birthday cakes and ambitions, a full schnitzel should never be small and being so, few that we see ordered this evening are finished. No matter. They started out by doing delivery during the various lockdowns and, hence, they have pizza-style boxes with which to package up leftovers. It’s clear the delivery business remains strong; throughout the evening there is a steady stream of riders turning up to take schnitzel joy to the sofas of north London. At which point I should acknowledge that this is not unique. The fine people of Middlesbrough have long had their take-away parmo traditions: essentially a schnitzel of chicken or pork, topped with a cheese-boosted béchamel. All hail the mighty parmo. I like Schnitzel Forever. It’s a good idea, well priced and well executed. That extends to the restaurant design. We tend only to notice such things when big bucks have been spent. Here, a modest space has been cleverly worked over, with elegant black and white tiling, cream banquettes and the smart use of cloudy Perspex panelling behind which lurk tropical fronds of easily maintained pure plastic to make the room look bigger. Like the menu, it all works. If you soon see a queue building at the door, assume they’re hospitality industry investors. Or people who just really love schnitzel. News bites I’ve long been a huge fan of Riley’s Fish Shack, on the beach at Tynemouth to the east of Newcastle, but have always feared for them each time the winter storms roll in. Now they have Riley’s Fish Shop, a bricks and mortar restaurant (and retail operation). The ever-changing blackboard menu includes whole sea bass and turbot, and various fillets alongside lobster platters and Lindisfarne oysters as well as game dishes. At rileysfishshop.com. The results of the annual survey of the London restaurant scene by crowd-sourced restaurant guide Harden’s are in. Alongside unsurprising news of large numbers of closures as a result of the pandemic, come eye-widening accounts of price inflation at the capital’s top end. In the 2020 guide there was just one place, sushi restaurant The Araki, averaging a spend of £200 a head. Now there are seven of them. The number of restaurants averaging £150 a head has leapt from nine to 24. Visit hardens.com And another snapshot of the challenges being faced by the hospitality industry: the end of both the furlough scheme and the moratorium on winding-up petitions which had stopped creditors taking action to get back money they are owed, combined with the need to repay government loans, are all now having a serious impact. UK restaurant insolvencies rose 31% in the last quarter, from 226 to 296.

Never. For many, you see, it’s their obsession, and at The Loch &amp; The Tyne in Old Windsor, before you know it, you could be perusing the eco-garden and composting area on a Vélosophy bike made out of recycled Nespresso pods. That said, The Loch &amp; The Tyne is an Adam Handling venture, run by his trusted, longstanding cohorts Steven Kerr and Jonathan McNeil, so if you were to break that rule, this is the place to do it. Over the past decade or so, Handling has become a leading light in reusing, replanting and giving a damn about the polar bears via The Frog in Covent Garden and the now defunct Ugly Butterfly in Chelsea, which was recently reborn in Carbis Bay, Cornwall. Handling and his team catered at the G7 summit in June, offering Macron and Merkel treats made from offcuts and local produce, although I’m certain they’d never have known how saintly it all was unless they had been expressly told. Handling’s approach to food waste has always been delicious, luxurious and playful, but if I told you one of my favourite things at The Loch &amp; The Tyne was a large, crisp potato scone covered generously in melted, pungent beauvale blue cheese and crisp onions, which I ate with a bright orange, north of the border twist on the porn star martini made with Irn-Bru, perhaps you’ll notice that we’re a long way from worthy. His formative years at Gleneagles hotel in Auchterarder are alive in such moments, while elsewhere on the menu there is Balmoral chicken and a posh fish and chips with tartare and curry sauces. My visit to Old Windsor was on a Saturday full of chores, suddenly rerouted by hunger. We were on the M25, somewhere between Staines and Heathrow, collecting a car from a garage – faulty central locking, since you ask, though I won’t bore you – when I remembered talk about Handling’s latest brainwave, a “traditional British pub” that serves tarts, souffles and gingerbread trifle in a leafy setting down some lane in Windsor where the Michelin-starred gastropub The Oxford Blue once lived. It’s a spacious, modern country pub with a large outdoor terrace, oversized parasols, tartan blankets and a beer garden with a fire pit. Indoors, it’s all exposed brickwork, comfy leather chairs and mahogany tables. The whole effect is calm, elegant and slightly dreamy: the kind of pub you take an overseas tourist to, to give them the sort of bucolic British vibe they’ve only ever seen when author/murder magnet Jessica Fletcher goes home to Blighty for a book tour. I have a rule of thumb when reviewing restaurants that you can tell “a good one” by how soon you begin subliminally planning to come back, which in this case was inside 12 minutes, when warm sourdough appeared with chicken butter topped with crunchy, fatty bullets of chicken “crackling”, followed by the aformentioned tatty scone – which one rarely sees on a menu this far south – and a light, crisp, beautifully seasoned lobster tart. We rampaged across the small plates because it was a balmy summer’s day, so sitting on a terrace eating a 300g ribeye with bone marrow seemed just a touch ambitious. Also, I wanted to try the twice-baked cheese souffle, a delicious if slightly sturdy affair served with pickles, and neither could we miss out on an oddly named dish called “Mother”, which remains one of the most eccentric things I’ve ever eaten. It turned out to be a peculiar, almost unnerving, alien-like mass of wafer-thin celeriac and apple arranged around moist black dates and some sort of soft cheese, and covered in a generous shower of black truffle. “I am not sure if I am enjoying this,” I said while lifting spoon after spoon to my confused mouth. I had to eat Mother before she ate me. By this point, I’d had two glasses of Handling’s own very good English sparkling wine, and was very much at the “Damn it, let’s stay the night and have dinner, too” point of the afternoon. And that, surely, is the point of lovely lunches: they make you want to abandon reality and set up home. I am more grateful than ever right now, when so much of hospitality is working poorly, when teams such as Handling’s just quietly get things done. For pudding, we had strawberry trifle, which came in a pretty, short-stemmed pudding bowl. It was all the colours a trifle should be – red then yellow then white – so I will accept the scattering of edible petals. The fruit and jelly layer featured chunks of gingerbread, which were odd, but unforgettable.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(145,'2021-07-30T09:00:04Z','The Cheese Barge, London W2: ‘Delicious daftness – restaurant review | Grace Dent on restaurants','At a time when owners are playing it very safe, hospitality concepts such as The Cheese Barge in Paddington make me very giddy. It’s a barge where the entire menu – starters, mains and pudding – revolves around cheese. A barge de fromage, if you will. Even just writing the booking in my diary made my heart dance, due to its bolshie yet delicious-sounding daftness, and because opening any restaurant involves all manner of meetings, business plans and feedback from naysayers. So I’m envisaging that before this 96ft-long double-decker vessel of curds made its – cough – “whey” to Paddington Basin, there will have been a considerable amount of quibbling from bystanders along the lines of: “So, there’s cheese for all three courses, even pudding?” and “But what about lactose-intolerants or aquaphobics?”, not to mention, “You’re docking it where? Paddington?! In the middle of an unlovable urban waterfront development where the Starbucks is one of the prettier bits?” None of these things derailed the plans of Mathew Carver, the man behind the venture, but then he’s got form, having previously launched Pick &amp; Cheese, a cheesy conveyor-belt joint in Covent Garden, where 25 different cheeses spin past under cloches, a bit like in a Yo! Sushi; there’s also a restaurant in Camden, a cheese street food truck and a shop called Funk in Hackney. Carver has hit on a notion, which I don’t disagree with, that we possibly lust after cheese a lot more than we acknowledge. It’s not weird to make a pilgrimage to a pudding-focused restaurant, such as Cake &amp; Bubbles by Albert Adrià or the Dominique Ansel bakery in Belgravia (which, sadly, closed last summer), so why not honour that other great passion of people who possibly know they could be eating “cleaner”, but, well, life is short, so what the hell? That brigade would enjoy a pungent, blue-veined Cropwell Bishop to start, stuffed into sweet, yielding, plump prunes and topped with crisp bacon. Then, perhaps, a 400g wheel of baked, milky-white, oozing Baron Bigod served with Coombeshead sourdough, garlic-roasted new potatoes, truffled mushrooms and Ampleforth beer chutney. Then how about a mascarpone-laden pudding with brown sugar meringue and cider brandy-poached peaches. See, now it doesn’t seem so strange at all, does it? The phrase “showcasing British produce” is flung around willy-nilly on menus these days, but in The Cheese Barge’s case, it is genuinely employing and experimenting with some of the UK’s loveliest things, making pommes aligot with crumbly Kirkham’s lancashire and grilled cheese sandwiches with Brue Valley mozzarella made in Glastonbury. You can even pop by just to sit on the open-top deck terrace and order a beer (craft, of course) and a £10 cheeseboard filled with Sinodun Hill, Gorwydd Caerphilly and Spenwood; a £4 side plate of Young Buck comes with house-made chocolate digestives. Alternatively, you can sit indoors in a pleasantly swanky dining room downstairs and go for the full four courses. It’s a peculiar sensation, I’ll admit, trying to order from a menu where absolutely everything sounds delicious, yet it’s all from the same sub-category of delicious, so there’s a chance it may tip you over into queasy. Do you begin confidently with a bowl of Westcombe fried curried curds and chilli honey? Answer: yes. These things are filthily good: crisp, plump, cheesy bullets with a sweet, chip-shop-curry kick. Next up, a humongous three-cheese pasty (Quicke’s, Ogleshield and Cornish gouda) with house ketchup – gorgeous pastry, but the filling’s perhaps a little runny; next time, I’ll have the squash spätzle made with English pecorino instead. If there was any disappointment, it was the “sharing” main of a rather small coil of pork, fennel and red wine sausage with the aforementioned aligot, which at £25 may raise a few eyebrows at being told to share it. That said, both the sausage and the potato were exceedingly rich, so maybe less is more, though good luck arguing that with greedy types who’ll see it more as an amuse-bouche. The mascarpone pudding, meanwhile, was thoughtfully balanced, booze-laced and topped with Bell Heather honey. It’s worth holding a little stomach room back for this final push into cheesy stupefaction. I went to Paddington Basin certain this would be something of a jokey, themed restaurant where I’d eat a glorified Cathedral City Breville and disembark in search of a lunch in a hurry. Instead, we sat for almost three hours, nibbling plates of Spenwood with quince or more Kirkham’s with homemade Yorkshire fruit cake. First a truck, then a barge and next, I’m hoping, a cheese-filled 737, where the destination is irrelevant and the cheese … well, the sky is the limit. It’s been a long and upsetting time for restaurants. A barge filled to the brim with fromage is silly, but fun, and I like it. • The Cheese Barge, Paddington Basin, Sheldon Square, London W2 (no phone).

Toastie £13, snacks £5.50-£7.75, mains £14-£16, dessert £5, beers from £5 a pint, wines from £28.50 Happiness is a well-made cheese toastie. The XXL Stove Top 3 Cheese Toastie with mustard at the Wigmore in London is so much more than that. It is bliss. It is a beautifully engineered, lusciously executed, burnished and bronzed tribute to the carnal love affair between toast and cheese. It was not what I expected. The Wigmore, which opened in 2017, is a pub as imagined by Michel Roux Jr of Le Gavroche, a temple to French classicism, where the devoutly greedy go to worship the gods of butter, cream and demi-glace. Le Gavroche is a kind of French embassy, only with better catering. Could the culinary Roux really understand the culinary Britishness of a food pub? My answer is a firm yes, albeit with a glutton’s honed sensibility. The Wigmore is an outcrop of the Langham Hotel, which sits across from the BBC at Portland Place. Inside it is a handsome vault of jade green wall and arch. There are high, marble-topped counters, with steampunk-style studs around the edges. There are globe lights and frosted glass panels and bar stools upholstered in leather the colour of salted caramel. Vital information: you can come here and just drink beers, many and various. They have casks of Thornbridge Lord Marples Bitter and Right to Roam Buxton, and kegs of their own Wigmore Rosehip Saison brewed for them by Yonder. It is very much a pub. But I could not be friends with, or even respect someone who came here and did so without looking at the menu, and upon seeing the listing for a toastie, with its eye-widening price tag of £13, wonder what the hell that was all about. It’s a foot long, but only if you have size 24 feet. It’s vast. The thinly sliced sourdough is clearly buttered before being essentially fried on the stove top. Inside is a mixture of Montgomery cheddar, Ogleshield and, for stretchiness, raclette. It is spun through with a fine dice of red onion and punched up with that mustard. Melted cheese oozes out the sides and crisps around the crusts. It is sliced into seven manageable pieces, and I wonder momentarily whether I could abandon eating anything else here today and just have this. I could do this very well. It is well within my skillset. I decide the £13 charge is not the outrage it might first have seemed. When it arrives, I know that I will be forced to leave some behind. Hence the deep joy is mixed with profound sadness. It is possible that too many of my emotions are invested in my lunch. We do have other things to eat. Among the snacks list of which this toastie is a part, is a trio of doll’s house-sized crumpets, buttered and topped with a pile of sweet white crab meat decorated prettily with ribbons of dried seaweed. Each one is an intense mouthful. There is also their take on the scotch egg, and it very much is their take. It arrives looking like a toasted sea urchin. The ball of spiced sausage meat, surrounding a quail egg with a jammy yolk, has been rolled not in breadcrumbs, but fronds of vermicelli. On contact with the hot oil, it has all stood up to stickleback-like attention. It could be an annoying bit of posturing were it not for the thick pond of raita-swirled dal underneath. It lubricates and spices up the whole proposition. The mains include a serious bit of cheeseburger, in a buxom sunflower seeded bun, with crispy shallots. A thick slice of grilled ox tongue rolls out the side of the bun like a bolt of cloth that cannot be contained. I admire that burger greatly as it passes by on the way to others, but do not mourn my choices, for there is a pie in my future. Pie culture in London has perked up immensely in the past few years, largely due to the example set by the great Calum Franklin at the Holborn Dining Room. What that man can’t do with shortcrust, egg wash and a bucket of minced pig isn’t worth knowing about. The primped, scored and glazed wonder served here holds its own against those. As I cut in, a savoury broth pools out across my plate. It is filled with hunks of smoked pork and mandolined carrot. On the side is a glossy quenelle of champ, the buttery mash generously threaded with spring onions. It is serious carb-on-carb action, in the best sort of way. But remember: there are carrots in the pie. That’s the veg covered, right? The clearest sign of the French antecedents lies with the roasted stone bass with encouragingly crisped skin. It comes on a lake of peas and bacon, studded with new potatoes, in a ripe butter emulsion of a sort the authors of Larousse Gastronomique would recognise and applaud. The Gallic turn is also there in a truly fabulous side salad of leaves, by turns purple and red, green and yellow, arranged like the very best blooms, in a chive-speckled vinaigrette. It is a mighty salad for £4.50. There is only one dessert on offer, which they call the Wigmore Soft Serve Sundae. It costs £5 and changes regularly. Recently it was based around peach melba. Today it is a tiramisu sundae. Scoop down through the whorls of soft ice-cream, the layers of grated chocolate and the crunchy chocolate balls, and at the bottom you will find the requisite coffee-soaked sponge. This is food to cancel the rest of the day for and, on a midweek lunchtime, the room is cheerfully full of people who clearly cannot recall what they are supposed to be doing after 2.30pm. To my left is a table of women who, for their lunch, have ordered a toastie each and a side of chips, with Bloody Mary salt. I admire their style and decide I should be more like them. Hark the call of the Wigmore toastie. I later learn that, from 19 October, they are running what they’re calling a Toastie Takeover. Three guest chefs – Andrew Wong of A Wong, Cyrus Todiwala of Café Spice Namaste and Anna Haugh of Myrtle Restaurant – will each design a toastie that will stay on the menu for four weeks. You can eat one and support a good cause, too, because £1 from every sale will go to support Calm, the pioneering anti-suicide charity. Just imagine: you can have the best toastie in London and do good. That’s a terrific day out by anybody’s standards. News bites The sausages are coming. Extrawurst, a Bratwurst takeaway chain with 30 outlets in Germany, is to open in the UK. They are planning ‘hundreds of sites’ across the country over the next three years, both kiosks and larger outlets with some seating. It will start with three of the larger units in Birmingham, Nottingham and a shopping centre in the West Midlands later this year, before expanding with the help of franchisees in 2022 (extrawurst.info). Former MasterChef winner Kenny Tutt has opened a second restaurant in his home town of Worthing, to go alongside Pitch, which he opened there in 2019. Bayside Social, which Tutt has described as being inspired by the art deco buildings of South Beach, Miami, is a laid-back seafood café right on the promenade. The opening menu includes calamari with aioli, crab cakes with tomato salsa and Baja fish tacos. There’s also a breakfast and brunch menu (baysidesocial.co.uk). A scheme to support the hospitality sector has been launched in Northern Ireland. Over 1 million people are now eligible to apply for a Spend Local card, which will be pre-loaded with £100, to be used in both hospitality and retail venues until the end of November.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(147,'2021-10-22T09:00:32Z','Ekstedt at the Yard, London SW1: ‘A bit like eating an actual plate of bonfire’ – restaurant review | Grace Dent on restaurants','I live in fear of an invite “to see the kitchen”. It happens often when I’m reviewing, and the honest answer is, “No, no, I do not want to meet a chef with a rictus grin and a cleaver, and whose last restaurant I helped to close down.” Still, at Niklas Ekstedt’s new place at the Great Scotland Yard hotel in Westminster, I’m glad I found myself, straight out of the traps on course number one of a seven-course tasting menu, up close and personal with an oyster flambadou. If I’d not seen the medieval nature of Ekstedt’s cooking set-up with my own eyes, I’d possibly not have taken seriously his claim to be cooking only with fire, and eschewing gas and electricity entirely. But then one sees the open, raging fire, with chefs taking turns to boil beef fat, then dramatically pouring it from a height over some oysters before dressing them with a pond-green nasturtium and beurre blanc dressing, and it’s all rather magical. Ekstedt has taken root in London, although he is already well known in his native Sweden, where in 2011 he opened Restaurant Ekstedt in Stockholm and where his main pastime of “raw ingredients cooked over an open fire” took shape. A quick search of his image throws up various shots of him in a soot-festooned bobble hat and enjoying the great outdoors, or at least setting fire to it. There’s a Jorvik Viking Centre feel about a Niklas Ekstedt kitchen, as if you’ve somehow wandered into a particularly lifelike tableau vivant of a blacksmith’s forge. There’s a firepit, wood-fired stove and wood-fired oven. That oyster, incidentally, was delicious, warmed through rather than fried by the oil, with a silky, bolshily bucolic dressing. If seven courses feels like a prison sentence – and more of that later – you can opt for just three instead, although the seven small but meaningful plates, plus various intermittent snacks, isn’t by any means overly long. In fact, this is a perfect date-night restaurant for diners who like being entertained by tales of venison hearts and vendace roe. It’s odd, a little challenging, but never, ever boring, and, as evenings go when you’re held captive by a tasting menu, this is about as good as it gets. It’s probably worth saying here that the Great Scotland Yard hotel is a rather peculiar venue. Personally, I’m a fan, but its shtick is divisive. Here’s a luxury hotel that wants, understandably, to capitalise on its cops and robbers history; the beautiful corridor that leads into Ekstedt, for instance, features genuine prison art, moving drawings by lonely criminals. The lobby, meanwhile, is opulent, dramatically lit and filled with sculptures, olde-worlde bookcases and gigantic fronds. The cocktail bar is more Gotham-esque than the actual themed Gotham cocktail bar just a mile down the road. As Richard Burton once said of Elizabeth Taylor, it’s all “a bit bloody much”. But then you cross into Ekstedt’s lair, and he’s clearly filled a few skips with soft furnishings since the previous residents of this space moved on. Suddenly, it’s all exposed brick, sage-green fabrics, mahogany shades and simple glassware from which to sip natural wines. I wasn’t drinking that night, so instead they offered me a kombucha pairing menu – at £45 a head – which was an absolute hospitality first, with each course appearing with a stranger, funkier, cloudier brew than the last. “This one tastes of feet!” I heard myself chirp at one stage. “Forty-five quid for a few cans of pop?!?” I hear you all shout, but this was, in fact, a wonderful way for non-boozers to feel included. So, yes, Ekstedt at the Yard, I’m a fan. Without wishing to spoil the experience, let me reveal some of the, ahem, journey. There is a plate of fine, peppery reindeer charcuterie that will make it hard to look Rudolph in the eye come December. There’s seared smoked venison heart with a wood-oven flatbread and lingonberries. A baked or, more accurately, fire-damaged leek turns up in a charcoal-flavoured cream with a thick layer of sunset-red vendace roe, and feels a bit like eating an actual plate of bonfire, though not in an unpleasant way. A follow-up course of lobster with caramelised cream and sweetcorn is comforting, like a lovely buffer between all the burning and bits of Bambi, but then we’re on to hay-smoked mallard with black pudding and turnip puree, which is brazenly blood, smoke and ember all over again. My favourite part of the evening, however, was the mole-coloured cep souffle pudding. Yes, it tasted of mushroom, there’s no getting around that, but that was offset by a gooey layer of wild blueberry and a pine-needle ice-cream that my heart still burns for. Mind you, everything smelled slightly of delicious smoke afterwards. I’ll never get rid of my gas hob, but it’s curiously comforting that there’s a Swedish bloke in Westminster who’d happily see the world burn. • Ekstedt at the Yard, 3-5 Great Scotland Yard, London SW1, 020-7925 4700.

They really mean it. And Hidden River Cafe is indeed hiding, albeit in my favourite part of Cumbria – the forgotten, untouched bit that visitors tend to ignore in their excitement to see the Lake District. This overlooks the glorious patch of almost untouched nothingness to the north-east of the Lakes that starts a few miles outside Carlisle, where you can skim along the southern side of the Scottish border, down miles of the narrowest, puddliest country lanes, passing through villages with names such as Catlowdy, Penton, Haggbeck and Bewcastle; names that, when I was a child, would trip off my grandmother’s tongue in broad Cumberland as we set off to visit cousins who lived all around this area. “Your great-aunt Joyce frae’ Catlowdy isn’t in ower’ grand fettle the noo,” she’d say. “She’s ga’arn into sek little room.” I’ll translate: “Joyce isn’t feeling very well and she’s losing weight, too.” The place had its own language, and though this was at least 40 years ago, as Charles and I drove towards Longtown, it felt almost unchanged. The satnav quibbled many times en route, and after a second three-point turn by a long-abandoned graveyard, you feel sceptical that there really is Persian hummus with chimichurri sauce and tempura Tenderstem broccoli with a hoisin dip close by. On arriving at the pretty cabin cafe, however, set in miles of rolling green nothingness and ordering the monkfish scampi with warm new potato salad, you might also notice that 5G is not an option here, and that the gorgeous cabins, should you happen to be staying overnight, do not have Wi-Fi, because the Hidden River Cafe is all about “your family really enjoying being off the grid”. That’s something to tell your teenagers while they try to strangle you, or maybe placate them with the vegetarian-friendly portobello mushroom burger with grilled halloumi. The place is the rather ingenious work of dairy farmer Rob Carr and his wife Rachel, alongside local chef Thomas Towle. Rob designed the five beautiful cabins made out of whole trees that are stacked skilfully on top of each other along the bank of the River Lyne – a river so well-hidden, I managed to live nearby for 18 years and never once heard it mentioned. After the cabins, plus a barn where they hold weddings, came the cafe, which is itself inside another cabin. No wonder my Cumbrian friends were so excited, recommending that I get up here sharpish for bowls of mussels with cider and pancetta, and for wagyu steaks with good, punchy rosemary fries. Hidden River Cafe’s menu is ever-changing, hearty, imaginative and surprisingly global: its current offering includes Moroccan lamb on herby coriander couscous, grilled chicken souvlaki and soft-shell crab with pickled samphire. That said, every time I’ve checked recently, the approach to feeding guests seems to have pivoted slightly, with a pizza menu and sometimes curries featuring, too. My brother swears by the fabulous Sunday lunch, with featherblade of Cumbrian beef and yorkies as big as your face, and I’ve heard reports of rib-sticking afternoon teas of ham hock terrine with piccalilli and french toast, raspberry ripple muffins and, of course, homemade scones. But, as I said, I went for my birthday breakfast, and although it may seem odd to write about the joys of an enormous vegetarian fry-up, there is an unparalleled splendour in tackling, as your first meal of the day, a plate of good hash browns, fried eggs, baked beans and decent vegetarian sausages with a round of white, buttered, toasted, Mother’s Pride-style bread. Eat big first thing, set your intentions – that’s what I say. Charles, displaying his southern, metropolitan tendencies, wanted poached eggs and mashed avocado on sourdough. We were the first customers, arriving brightly at 10.02am into a deserted cabin, so we ate to the sound of torrential rain battering the roof and pelting the fields around us. Perfect. “So where are we, exactly?” asked Charles, who had driven here, but was still none the wiser. “We’re sort of near the Scottish border,” I told him, “but very definitely in England. Sort of near Hadrian’s Wall, but not really near anywhere else apart from Longtown, not far from the main road to Langholm, but if you carry on east, we’d be in Once Brewed.” “This means nothing to me,” he said, sounding like Midge Ure. I finished the extra toast with butter and strawberry jam, knowing that, while places such as this exist, it will be a long time before I, like great-aunt Joyce, go into “sek little room”. • Hidden River Cafe Longtown, Carlisle, Cumbria, 01228 791318.

In London, especially, there has been a recent post-lockdown glut of new openings with dizzyingly steep prices. Just as Tom Kerridge’s £32.50 fish and chips became normal (they’ve since gone up to £36.50), Jason Atherton’s all-new bistro, Harrods Social, swung into view with £19 asparagus starters, mac’n’cheese with braised beef at £29 and a mango smoothie at a quite hysterical £12.50. Yes, yes, I know this is Harrods, where the tourist clientele are considered fair game, but every day I read menus that make me envisage the management cackling like Smash advert aliens while they set the prices. The Harrods Social “English garden salad” for £17.50 is peak “We saw you coming”, but many fancy restaurants take the attitude that if you quibble about the pricing, it’s not really your type of place. Meanwhile, at Marugame Udon, the most stripped-back udon dish starts at £3.45. Kamaage is served straight from a kama pot with a smoky fish dashi to dip your plump noodles in. From there, the udon dishes range from about £5-8, and for the price of that garden salad, you could also throw in some freshly made beef nikutama udon or chicken katsu curry udon, as well as a tempura boiled egg, limitless soft-serve ice-cream and bottomless peach ice tea, which you’ll find by the complimentary, build-your-own condiment station. This is a magical land where you can sprinkle spring onion, chilli and pickled ginger with jubilant abandon; it is also where the tenkasu live – that is, tempura batter scrapings, or scraps, as we call them in the north. It’s much like Pizza Hut’s Ice Cream Factory, but for spicy umami things. In fact, Marugame Udon reminds me of two other huge chains – it’s a bit Wagamama with a nod towards an Ikea cafe. Imagine a canteen where you grab a tray, choose a freshly made udon dish, then move past piles of serve-yourself warm, battered and breadcrumbed things – pumpkin korroke and nori tofu tempura are especially good – before tackling the omusubi section (seasoned rice with a topping and wrapped in seaweed), before paying up by the tills near the pickles, kimchi, kombucha and a white wine called Nice that’s sold cold by the can. Marugame Udon already has about 800 sites in Japan and a further 250 around the world, and in the opening week of this, its first British branch – a 100-seater restaurant in Spitalfields, east London – they had people queuing up at 11am. Within days of opening, they announced a second venue, a 150-seater at the O2 Arena on the Greenwich Peninsula. If this billion-dollar rollout goes to plan, there is a Marugame Udon coming to near you. I take most multinationals that vow to make an impact on our eating habits with a pinch of salt, but I think this lot are in with a fighting chance. True, Britain doesn’t have a shortage of places to slurp fat, slippery udon, and some will argue that Marugame’s chewy sanuki udon, made in-house, are just fine, but in fact they prefer Koya Soho, which has table service and a sense of elegance. But did I tell you about the space-age Asahi machine that pours a pint in four seconds? Or the fabulous heated Japanese toilet seats in the ladies’, which make spending a penny an actual pleasure? (They play Japanese language lessons in there, too.) What Marugame Udon has in buckets is a sense of fun, low prices, space for larger groups to dine together (and pay separately), plus many nooks and window seats for solo diners to nip in for 20 minutes’ respite and a bowl of two-pork tonkotsu with charsu and spicy miso pork mince in a rich broth and topped off with a wobbly onsen egg, then a dorayaki pancake for afters. On my last lunch at Marugame Udon, I had the chicken paitan udon featuring marinated thigh topped with ginger and a side of pickles. The tempura egg has become one of my feelgood hits of 2021. Yes, it’s a battered boiled egg, but how did I live without this for so long? The kakiage in the tempura section resembles a gigantic onion bhaji that has mated with a hay bale, but is, in fact, potato, carrot and other veg all sliced matchstick-thin, then battered and fried. The website advises me it’s 434 calories a pop, which may make me think twice about piling one on top of my next bowl of kimchi yaki udon. That said, the soda machine also offers the option of a sugar-free, old-school cloudy lemonade that I’m also a little in love with. I did not know that I needed another bad habit – having only recently tackled my fixation with Tonkotsu’s chilli chicken ramen – but then Muragame Udon turned up, put on the stoves and the soda machine, and reeled me right in. • Marugame Udon 114 Middlesex Street, London E1 (no phone).

Starters £8-£10, mains £14-£22, desserts £8, wines from £24 Something odd is going on. It’s a very good kind of odd, but odd all the same. It is as if my brain, the reflective, processing part of me, is lagging far behind my tongue, the boisterous, bluntly sensing part of me. I’m being knocked sideways by the bold hit of citrus and chilli; by flavours with the brightness turned up to maximum, alongside the bash of seaweed and the softness of sesame. And then there are the dizzying visuals. The plate in front of me is a ravishing blast of crimson and green. There are lozenges of the deepest purple overlaid by lacy fronds of micro herbs. There is an awful lot going on in this plate of tuna Nikkei ceviche, and it’s all kinds of fabulous. It has been served to me at Chakana, a Peruvian restaurant in Moseley, Birmingham, that opened two years ago. I am quietly ashamed of myself for taking so damn long to get here. The chef Robert Ortiz has serious credentials. He grew up in Peru’s Amazonian hinterland, near the Marañón River, cooking with the family matriarchs before starting to cook professionally. He moved to London where he trained at some of the city’s biggest hotels. After a stint back in Peru, he became head chef at the Peruvian restaurant Lima in London’s Fitzrovia, where he won a Michelin star. I must step carefully here to avoid sounding like the grotesque snob I obviously am. Moseley is a vivid and dynamic place. En route from the town centre, I pass intriguing looking Yemeni and Syrian grill houses. There are other restaurants of ambition in these parts, not least Carters. Nevertheless, to find Ortiz in this part of Birmingham doing his thing in a converted bank – the private dining room is located inside the former vault, complete with reinforced door – feels like finding a gorgeous tropical flower at the base of a glowering mighty oak. The conversion is clever, a gentle take on whitewashed adobe, with vivid slabs of art on the walls. But the real art, the most shameless gashes of colour, are obviously here on the table in front of us. It begins with a bowl of toasted and toastie corn kernels mixed with the thinnest and crispest slices of dried Jerusalem artichoke. Our waiter jokes that it’s the kind of salty bar snack designed to make you order more drinks. I think it’s the kind of bar snack designed to make you order more of the bar snack. There is a tiny tart made with the butteriest of pastries – a testament perhaps, to all that London hotel experience – filled with minced chicken, yellow chilli and ground walnuts. There is a hot potato and beef croquette, gusting meaty spiciness at us with each bite. There may well have been a couple of pisco sours to send these all on their way. We only wanted to make our waiter feel vindicated. And then there’s that tuna Nikkei ceviche which, as our waiter tells us, with an enthusiasm borne of having spent significant time in Peru, draws on the country’s melded culinary and cultural influences. In particular it’s about the Japanese immigration into Peru in the early 20th century. They brought with them the titular Nikkei style of cooking, hence the raw tuna. But here, too, is tiger’s milk, that punchy sauce and cooking liquor of lime juice and chilli, ginger, garlic and various other things besides, depending upon who’s making it. Another equally vivid plate brings thinly sliced, sweet and sticky raw scallop in a ricotta tiger’s milk, rendered the brightest of yellows through the application of achiote oil. It is punctuated by dots of chia seeds, like determined full stops, alongside shiny jewels of amaranth, looking like the glossiest of caviar. For the amount of work that has gone into these dishes the price tag of a tenner each is great value. For the mains we have a pearly piece of hake seasoned by being steamed within a gossamer-thin piece of dried seaweed that has rehydrated as the fish has cooked. Underneath there is the sweet and sour of a cherry tomato and soft onion escabeche. That in turn lurks on heaps of nutty black quinoa, which recall the mustard and cress seeds we all used to sprinkle on wet tissue paper when we were kids in the hope that they might grow. And all of it comes in a limpid broth that must be spooned away. A main of slow-roasted suckling pig, which turns into shreds eagerly beneath my fork, is the encouraging darkness to the hake’s light. It rests on a mess of roasted yuca root and comes with a meaty jus flavoured with the deepest of Peruvian chocolates. But it is an Andean potato stew that rocks me back in my seat. It is another head-turning beauty: a heap of buttercup-yellow potatoes, dried and smoked, are dotted with cubes of purple potato, and laid with green leaves, deep red flowers and black grapes. I expect it to be one of those hugely comforting, solid adventures in carbs, but there is so much more going on here. It is a journey into the savoury. It is as if each cube of potato has been cooked separately to that point where bite persists, where it tastes intensely of itself. It is the potato as love interest; it is the potato as marquee name. Given that the potato is central to Peru’s agricultural and botanical heritage this is as it should be. We are done for, but we still must finish. There is a dollop of intense Andean chocolate mousse, spiked with purple potato wafers and sprinkled with bee pollen, which somehow manages not to be cloying and overwhelming. Then there is a white chocolate cup, filled with a custard apple mousse on top of a little dulce de leche. On top of this sits a fragile tuile sprinkled with pink sugar, as if it is time for a children’s party. Struck by my shining positivity, one reader recently suggested I had become prone to hyperbole. Nonsense. Whatever the caricature, I am just a naturally sunny individual who looks only for the good. Certainly, if I experience the good, I damn well say so. And Chakana is very good indeed. It’s that rare thing: a genuinely exciting restaurant. Don’t miss out on the ride. News bites Chef Stuart Gillies, one-time chief executive of Gordon Ramsay Holdings, is to open a second restaurant after the success of the first Bank House wine bar and kitchen in Chislehurst. The new outpost, located on London Road in Sevenoaks, Kent, will be called Number Eight. As at the first, the menu is expected to be built around small plates: the likes of beetroot hummus with toasted flat bread, wild mushroom pappardelle with crispy onions and a bakewell tart to finish. Fife-born sommelier Matilda Ruffle, who ran supper clubs with her chef husband Tom Tsappis in London, has returned to Scotland to take over the Killiecrankie House Hotel in Pitlochry. The couple are now offering an £85 tasting menu very much drawing on the locality. A sample includes dishes entitled ‘Venison, Peat and Brambles’, ‘Dripping-Fried Porridge’ and ‘Flower of Scotland’. Rather cheerily, it finishes with Sweeties. At killiecrankiehouse.com. An analysis by CGA and AlixPartners, the data analysis company for the hospitality industry, has found that the sector lost around 1,000 sites between July and the end of September. It works out at an average of 16 closures a day, with the majority of those closures hitting independently run pubs, restaurants and bars rather than the chains.

Staffing issues and brief opening hours are normal, while all the delicious, sanely priced places are booked up six months in advance by the control freaks in every Lake District Weekend Woo-Hoo! WhatsApp group. This leaves a plethora of nigh-inaccessible fine-dining spots that almost nobody local has ever visited. They’re often in hotels, with big-name chefs, where your tatty banger will have been noted by security from the moment you turned into their majestic driveway, and where an overnight stay for two with dinner will set you back about £1,000, with check-in at 3pm and checkout by 11am. At the Linthwaite House hotel, where the Simon Rogan restaurant Henrock lives, I was quoted £775 by a “bargain” website for a room for two on 29 August. I’ve lived among London dandies for decades, so am used to high-rollers, but still, even I can’t envisage settling a bill of that magnitude without openly weeping at reception. However, of all the Lake District’s pinky-in-the-air places that exist only for the fleeting delight of fancy people, lunch at the gorgeous Henrock is the one that truly moved me. If you have a special occasion, Henrock at Linthwaite is one worth scrimping and saving for – with starters at about £13 and mains £30, you could go easy on the booze and get out for about £75 a head. From the moment you exit your vehicle, it’s all, well, a bit too much. The 14 acres of landscaped gardens feel like something from the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World list; in fact, I fail to believe that Nebuchadnezzar’s hanging gardens were prettier than Henrock’s cocktail terrace with its dizzying vantage point across Lake Windermere, or, for that matter, the private tarn, the sculpture collection, the outdoor chess or the pretty boules pitch. I felt like Alice in Wonderland. And all this is before you meet the charming, world-class staff and order a zero fashioned – a banana-flavoured spiced-rum old fashioned/piña colada hybrid. Yes, it works, and yes, I had two. Then I sighed with a heady mix of peak elation and existential regret that I couldn’t stay at least a week. Why, why, why did I let that hot piece of fluff Bernie Ecclestone slip through my fingers last time he was on the market? How difficult could it be to be married to a billionaire, mop-topped nonagenarian who smells of petrol? Not difficult at all when you can hang out in exclusive bars with 20 Scottish single malts on the menu before lunching on lacquered smoked eel with XO custard and soy mushroom dressing, followed by Peking duck with gochujang and date croquette. Surprisingly for a restaurant by Simon Rogan, a man who famously loves British produce and playful experimentation with traditional British cooking, Henrock is definitely and confidently pan-Asian. With head chef Sam Fry at the helm, the menu is a journey of curious, imaginative flavours. A starter of aubergine is glazed to glossy, crunchy, heavenly heights with saikyo miso, festooned with furikake and served with a rich vegetable dashi broth. This is vegetarian cooking at its utter pinnacle. Another starter of cured salmon is almost as wondrous: a generous, lightly spiced fillet of salmon, pink on the inside, is titivated with puddles of wasabi, avocado and nashi pear, and a smattering of ponzu. A main course of hake – also generous – arrives encrusted with five-spice seasoning, and a mush of broad bean, a fried oyster and a shrimp-and-lemongrass sauce, while gorgeous Herdwick lamb comes with spiced lentils and flavours of wet garlic and sumac. As for the puddings, they steal my heart to the point where I am planning a return for afternoon tea before I’ve even asked for the lunch bill. Chocolate, raspberry and peanut tart is all the right levels of exceedingly ornate, sweet, crunchy and dirtily mainstream – a Snickers bar on steroids, if you will. The vanilla parfait could quite easily escape your attention, sitting there on the menu looking ever so humble and not worth a punt, but then it turns up decorated in tiny cherries compressed in woodruff and opens up horizons of vanilla that you didn’t think possible, despite having eaten vanilla things since you were old enough to sit upright. And that is the point of restaurants such as Henrock: they blow your mind a little bit and leave you cerebrally different from the slightly grumpy woman who got out of the car a couple of hours earlier and said, “The problem with these bloody fancy places in the Lakes, set in posh hotels and with silly menus, is I can’t work out who the hell wants to eat in them, let alone ever come twice.” Reader, it turns out it’s me. • Henrock Linthwaite House, Crook Road, Bowness-on-Windermere, Cumbria, LA23 3JA, 015394 88600.

Small plates £7.50-£10, large plates £16.50-£25, desserts £6.50-£7, wine from £21 My name is Jay Rayner and I am powerless in the face of good bread. I am especially powerless in the face of the treacle and malt bread with a whipped peak of Marmite butter, served to me at Brook’s, a startlingly good modern brasserie opposite the civic hall in Brighouse, West Yorkshire. It arrives oven hot and shaped as a tall, pert muffin. The top is glazed to a shine with a slick of sticky treacle. I tear at it, so that it puffs warm, sweet-savoury gusts of come-hither hot air. The texture seems open until I chew and it becomes satisfyingly cakey. When spread lavishly with the butter, it reminds me of the dark slices of Soreen paved with salted Anchor, eaten on winter afternoons when I was a kid. Only this malt loaf has grown up a bit. It is Soreen’s older brother, the more sophisticated one who has seen things. Now I’m faced by a conundrum, one known well to those with what we like to call a “healthy appetite”. The quality of this £3.50 bread course, the very obvious attention to detail and the Stanley knife-sharp execution, suggest the food to come could be very good indeed. Which means I must leave room for it. But look: some of the bread remains. And I am but a man; a mess of human frailties and urges. What am I supposed to do? I must eventually ask our waiter to remove the plate, unfinished. I wave it off like a parent sending their most beloved child abroad for their own good. Full disclosure: booking Brook’s was a punt. I had to be in Leeds. It was a perfect opportunity to pick up a review in the city. If only it were that simple. Very new readers start here: the UK recently introduced a post-Brexit immigration and employment policy which told the tens of thousands of EU nationals who made up a significant vertebra or two in the very backbone of the hospitality industry, that they were no longer welcome here. Many of them took the hint and went elsewhere. And if you do not like your restaurant reviews served with a massive eye-roll of political comment, do not blame me. Blame those who voted for this madness. Of course, there are also Covid issues and salary issues. But the fact is, a significant slab of the workforce has simply left. As a result, restaurants have shortened their working hours. Every place I considered worth reviewing in Leeds was not open for lunch. I cast my net wider and, courtesy of Amanda Wragg, who writes for the Yorkshire Post (and is one half of the duo behind the brilliant Yorkshire restaurant blog Squidbeak), found my way to Brook’s. In late 2019, Darrell and Petra Brook retired after 30 years of noble service to the town. Lauren Midgley and Greg Foggo took over. They kept the name, gave the space a clean, modern makeover in shades of ultramarine, and installed in the kitchen a chef named Dan Maxwell, whom they had met while working together at the Gray Ox in Hartshead. You may not know Maxwell’s name. You should. His lunchtime menu is a mixture of small plates priced at a tenner or less, and large plates which barely nudge into the teens. It reads a little restlessly, but makes total sense on the plate. The flavours are reliably big and self-assured. In a few places the cooking nods towards the Middle East. There is, for example, a duck egg, breaded and deep fried so that when you cut into it, the sunrise of a yolk leaks across a punchy mess of baba ghanoush. Rather than a purée for those short on teeth, the roasted aubergine still has bite and texture, given extra crunch by the addition of honey cashews and salty discs of sliced green olive. Some may take exception to the use of the word tagine in the title of a seafood dish, heavy with the waft of cinnamon, and built upon harissa-spiced chickpeas, mussels, smoked almonds, samphire and one fat prawn. As ever, tangles over nomenclature are trumped by the punch and poise of the cooking. Slices of spiced duck breast pastrami arrive with a large dollop of celeriac remoulade. But the high-kicking star is a long-braised and deeply sauced pig’s cheek tottering upon a disc of their own black pudding. That black pudding, made here from scratch, is a luscious joy, full of plumped pearl barley, chopped apple and golden sultanas and with a loose texture that moves it an ocean away from the dense tile grouting that clumsy attempts often become. This will now be the black pudding against which all others must be judged. There are doll’s-house onion rings for crunch and sautéed wild mushrooms and, underneath, a silky turnip purée. It’s a serious and significant plateful for £8. The side dishes include a Jerusalem artichoke aligot, a fancy name for outrageous mash spun through with encouraging amounts of cheese. The artichokes arrive as bronzed crisps, drowning cheerfully in the mash. And then there are the sliced, confited potatoes, pressed, then deep-fried (made famous by London’s Quality Chophouse) that arrive looking like so many compacted golden Kettle Chips. It’s not my most elegant description, but it’s accurate. We locate space for their caramelised fig and pecan tarte tatin, which is a dark confection of caramel and crisp pastry with, for balancing acidity, a sparkling scoop of a crème fraîche sorbet. In the evenings, the menu expands a little, as is customary, and some of the mains hover around the £20 mark. Even so, the value is obvious, helped by a concise wine list apparently priced to make you consider ordering another bottle, even on a school night. Do look up the Sunday brunch menu that includes their own crumpets, a bacon chop and pumpkin spiced pancakes. Service is cheery and efficient. The place hums with a comfortable contentment, which may be down to the mere fact of survival. Six months after the new owners took over, Storm Ciara swept through the Calder Valley, causing flooding along its length, including in Brighouse, which impacted upon Brook’s. Then came the pandemic. But they’re back. And they’re thriving. Come for the bread. Stay for the black pudding. Don’t miss the confit potatoes. Or the seafood tagine. Heck, stay for all of it. News bites It is the encouraging trend for 2022. Argentine steakhouse chain Gaucho has announced plans to open a carbon-neutral branch in Glasgow by Valentine’s Day. They will be working alongside charity partner Not For Sale to offset their footprint through a reforestation programme in the Amazon. Meanwhile, the entirety of the Hawksmoor steakhouse chain has pledged to become carbon-neutral in 2022, and in Liverpool, the Middle-Eastern restaurant and bar company Maray has announced that it is now carbon-negative. It’s a big hello to Qavali, a new restaurant on Birmingham’s Broad Street, which takes its inspiration from the route travelled by qawwali music, associated with Sufism, from Turkey and Iran through Afghanistan to the Indian subcontinent. In effect this means an eclectic menu of Turkish-inspired dips, charcoal grilled kebabs, biryanis cooked under puff pastry lids and various Indo Persian stews. At qavali.com. Dipna Anand, whose family launched the venerable Brilliant Restaurant in Southall in 1975, is opening a new venture inside Somerset House on London’s Strand next week. The short menu will be Punjabi and South Indian including grills and fish curries, while the décor will reflect her family’s heritage both in India and Kenya.

Starters £4.50 or £8 per head for a selection, mains £14-£15.50, desserts £6.25, wines from £21 Restaurant names matter. If you reference hedgerows, petals and berries, you are telling us you cook only to serve nature’s bounty. You may do it brilliantly or not very well at all, but at least we know your intention before crossing the threshold. Use words related to the shore and we have an expectation of a menu built around the most recent catch. And if you call your restaurant Sexy Fish, it indicates you have the sensibility of a 14-year-old boy who gets off on the underwear ads in his mother’s copy of Cosmopolitan. If you honestly think this is a good name for a restaurant, you should be forced to sit in a locked room with a pile of rotting herring for two days. Then you can tell us how bloody sexy you think fish really are. If this reads as if I have some corrosive beef with restaurateur Richard Caring, that’s because I do; the tawdry stereotypes used to market his Ivy Asia restaurants are fully deserving of opprobrium. There’s a restaurant in Sidcup called Sophie’s Choice which, given the plot of the William Styron novel, is a little disconcerting. And I’ve always had a soft spot for what I assume to be the sweet and literal act of translation that has resulted in a south London Chinese restaurant being called After Taste. I’m not judging the food or service at either, only the names. The Pigs, a low-slung pub not far from Holt in North Norfolk, is making a serious statement with its name. They can serve anything they like, but a good slab of it better have something to do with pigs. The headline news is that they meet their commitments, and do so with enthusiasm and vigour. I have long said that there are no bad words, only words used badly. However, there are some combinations that make me flinch. Among them is the phrase “hearty fare”. It speaks of forced chumminess and Ukip bingo nights and the heady waft of Lynx Africa. Yes, of course I’m a snob. Still, it works here. There is nothing elegant or poised about the cooking at the Pigs. That is a positive. It is solid, unselfconscious and, yes, hearty fare. It is there to feed you and keep feeding you until you lay down your cutlery and realise you’ve been roundly overfed. I’m told that the building has expanded somewhat since first it opened. Now there are a series of interlocking rooms stretching in all directions, but the staff have no problems servicing the brisk trade that fills them. The laminated menu appears to be more a symptom of these complicated Covid times than any attempt to place the business alongside other wipe-down food pubs. I could list all the starters. I could tell you that it includes honey roasted figs with goat’s cheese and chopped walnuts, as well as a rarebit with tomato chutney and mushrooms on toast. This is not what I’m here for. I am here for the Piggy Pieces, a mixed board of their pig-based starters at £16 for two. They have very much nailed the essentials. Start with the crackling. If that’s a disappointment, you might as well curse the gods of expectations and sod off home. The two pieces here are crunchy and furiously bubbled. They are salty and have just the right underlay of fat. They lie, like some honour guard, across the top of the dense, spiced and potted pork that breaks into threads as you plunge into it. There are doll’s house-sized cheese and smoked ham bread rolls, served warm, to spread it on. To one side is a flaky, sesame seed-speckled sausage roll, atop a dollop of their own fruity brown sauce. On the other side is a black pudding and pork scotch egg, the yolk just the right side of jellied. There is a pot of crunchy pickled vegetables which, slightly oddly, is mostly sweetcorn, but which does the job of cutting through the plunging depths of what is here. There is also a cast iron skillet of sweet and tangy barbecue beans, complete with lardons. It is in the logic of this menu that I am destined to meet them again. While I adore pork belly, I rarely order it as much as I would desire, because that would get repetitive. But hurrah. I have an excuse. Here, it is served as a slow cooked, bronzed and generous round, in a huge lake of those beans. Across the top is a piece of extremely good black pudding, seared so the outside has a salty crunch. There is a peak of stewed apple and then, naturally enough, more planks of crackling. It is £15.50 of “No dinner for me tonight, thanks.” We complete the theme with the Hog Butty: a toasted bun filled with most of the things we’ve already met, beautifully repackaged into an ungraspable sandwich. Use a knife and fork. There is well-sauced pulled pork, a slab of the seared pork belly, another of the black pudding and apple sauce. There are chips. There is crunchy red cabbage. There are honey-roasted root vegetables. It is a lot of simple points, well made. A lemon meringue sundae of ice-cream and lemon curd, cream and meringue, is a concerted attempt at a palate cleanser. A strawberry tart is a quick piece of assembly, the sliced fruit laid over a crème patisserie filling. On the side is a scoop of elderflower sorbet which, after all that had gone before, was really the only dessert anyone needed. The drinks list is big on ales, many of them local, including Jigfoot Norfolk Golden and Woodforde’s Wherry. I have no idea what these are like. I just adore the names. The short selection of wines all come by the glass, carafe and bottle. The bill will not make you gasp, and if you have a Norfolk Passport, a scheme giving discounts across the region, you’ll get 10% off. Do note that from this month they will continue to open for breakfast, but not for lunch Monday to Friday, because of overly familiar hospitality sector staff shortages. But they remain open for dinner and all weekend, and it’s very much worth going there to discover just how well the Pigs lives up to its name. I mean, they could have called it Sexy Pigs. But that sounds like the title of an episode of Black Mirror penned by Charlie Brooker. And no one would want to eat there. News bites Amid various new restaurant openings, comes a rebirth. After a decade-long break chef Mark Wadsworth has reopened the Brighton favourite Due South, in collaboration with the owners of Riddle &amp; Finns. The kitchen is built around a live fire grill and the plan is to source 80% of their ingredients from within 35 miles of Brighton. The current menu features grilled oysters with lardo, sweet miso chilli skate wing and butter grilled kale with almonds, chilli and ginger. Visit duesouthrestaurant.co.uk. Meanwhile, early next month chef Nick Rudge, formerly of The Fat Duck, is to open the Jackdaw in Conwy, close to his home town of Llandudno. During lockdown he ran a takeaway business, also called Jackdaw, out of his parents’ kitchen. The new 30-cover venture, located above a bingo hall in the town, will run an à la carte menu for dinner on Wednesday and Thursday evenings, and a tasting menu on Fridays and Saturdays. Jackdaw is the name given to someone born within the walls of Conwy. At thejackdawconwy.co.uk. Throughout September and October more than 200 restaurants, including Ox Club in Leeds, Darjeeling Express in London and the Pig group of hotels, are adding £1 to their menus to support Action Against Hunger’s Love Food Give Food campaign.

Starters £4-£10, mains £8-£19, desserts £4-£7, wines from £22 Brown foods are the best. We know this. Brown foods are about caramelised sugars and the Maillard reaction; they’re hefty flavours, emphasised and accentuated. They conjure images of prehistoric campfires and the lick of the flame before the lick of the tongue. So much about Brighton’s Burnt Orange, which opened in June, is calculated to trigger these lustful, crisped and crispy thoughts. The name was given to a shade of orange in 1915 and is, say web sources I’ve decided to trust, designed to evoke thoughts of leaping flames. Step inside the achingly refurbished site on Middle Street, just up from the seafront, and it’s all very much burnt orange. Take in the toasty toned leather banquettes, the varnished slat-wood frontage to the bar, the downlit stone walls with chunks of flint, the paint work in shades of… well, you get the idea. By this point the presence of a stonking wood-fired oven at the heart of the kitchen almost goes without saying. At Burnt Orange there’s a lot of searing and blistering, smoking and flaming. The menu is sprinkled liberally with these words. There are also outbreaks of Persian limes and harissa, preserved lemons and wild garlic. It thrums with an apparent eagerness to display on-trend credentials. Because the site is just a few doors down from where Skint Records used to have its offices, they have even asked the label’s one-time star signing Norman Cook, AKA Fat Boy Slim, to “curate” the music. At which point I ball my fists and feel moved to repeat a rant. Curate is not another word for “choose”, however much those bearded men who write craft beer menus might wish it were otherwise. Cook hasn’t curated anything. He has chosen some tunes. Oh look. I appear to be assembling the evidence for the prosecution. What saves Burnt Orange from being an annoyingly self-conscious exercise in trend-surfing is the food. The complex dish descriptions and that wood-fired oven deliver on their heat-bubbled promise. Given the team behind it, led by skilled restaurateur Razak Helalat, that’s unsurprising. They know what they’re doing. They also have the Salt Room, housed in an outcrop of the cheerless Hilton Metropole on the front. There, among many good things, I was served an expertly flame-grilled whole fish, which showed a clear understanding of the power of both direct and indirect heat. Elsewhere in Brighton (and more recently, London), they have the Coal Shed where everything is, as the name suggests, cooked over burning coals. Now, it’s all about the impact of smouldering wood. Among the starters at Burnt Orange there’s a crudo of smoked stone bass. There’s grilled halloumi from Sussex, as well as heat-blistered sardines with fried bread and an anchovy cream. Lamb shoulder has been long-smoked until it is on the edge of a breakdown, then shredded, formed into fat filo-wrapped “cigars” and fried to crisp. On the side is a dollop of cooling yoghurt. It is a lot of textures and butch lanolin flavours playing catch-up with each other. Spiced calamari fritti, under a generous leaf fall of sliced chillies, come with a preserved lemon aïoli the colour of daffodils. The thinnest slices of friable toast are piled with salted cherries, tomatoes and a tumble of buffalo stracciatella, that milky, foetal cheese of stretched curds. It’s a canapé designed by someone who has never spilt food down their shirt. It’s nice to eat: fresh and curiously purifying amid all the caramel star turns. It’s just a total bugger to get into your mouth, without disgracing yourself. I disgrace myself. The main courses are where the real action is. A thick slab of aubergine has loitered in the oven until it has reached a paunchy baba ganoush softness, and is laid on a puddle of sour cream. It’s glazed with miso, pelted with pomegranate seeds and finally, for texture and giggles, sprinkled liberally with fried onions. Most things should be. A slab of rib-eye is marinated in fermented chilli for flavour rather than brow-furrowing heat, then given a full wood firing, and topped with melting Tropea onions, capers and a dribble of jus. There’s also something described as a pork shawarma, which does make my brow furrow. I associate shawarma, an Arabic word, with the generally Muslim, non-pork-eating Middle East. Subsequently, I check in with Claudia Roden, the great expert on the region’s food. In Greece and Cyprus, she says, there is a kind of doner using sliced pork, which is referred to as a shawarma. Except here, they are serving heavily sauced cubes of pork belly. I send over a picture and Roden identifies it as souvlaki. Words used on a menu like this do matter. They should help you understand what you’re ordering. These don’t. Still, the cuts of meat are pleasingly soft and heat-kissed to a sticky dark caramel. For light against the shade, there’s a perky salad of shredded fennel. It’s all very nice. It’s just not a shawarma. The short dessert menu is another one of those designed for ease of service. There’s a well-made lemon tart because, right now, offering one is apparently a condition of getting a restaurant licence. Naturally, there’s a scoop of chocolate mousse. This one comes with sugared macadamias and cherries. The real eye-catcher is their drop-dead-gorgeous pistachio ice-cream, with dribbles of chocolate and fresh mint. Bravo. Have that. Prices are keen, with most dishes in single figures and only a few in the teens. Or you can pay £35 a head and get them to chuck half the menu at you. On a warm weekday lunchtime Norman Cook’s choice of top tunes ricochets vigorously off all the hard surfaces in a way that will make the space difficult for some. Restaurants tend to be set up by younger people who have yet to experience the sensory ravages of age. One day it will be their turn. Still, service runs at a cheery clip, and there’s a good stage show from the open kitchen. A quick note on booze. Among the cocktails is a concoction of Grand Marnier, vermouth, bourbon and cherries called the Bitter Untwisted. It should probably be the house drink of the Restaurant Critics members club, should one ever open which trust me, it never will. News bites In a crowded market the Delicious Cookbook, which is designed to be personalised, looks like fun. It starts with a choice of cover, the option to put the recipient’s name in the title, and a dedication inside. There are then a dozen recipe sections – Impressive Main Courses, Marvellous and Meat-Free, Showstopping Desserts and so on – from which you choose six, before swapping recipes according to taste. The shellfish section includes baked eggs with crab and cayenne, while for meat-free there’s a tomato, thyme and ricotta tart. It costs £21.99 for the paperback and £24.99 for hardback. Five years after they were forced to shut their original restaurant in London’s Shoreditch, the team behind the Mexican Santo Remedio, near London Bridge, are returning to the area with a new venture. Santo Remedio Taqueria will open in September. It will have a changing list of monthly specials and a takeaway hatch ‘serving an array of Mexican street food favourites’. Visit santoremedio.co.uk. The South Lodge Hotel in West Sussex has appointed chef Greg Clarke to run their Pass restaurant for the next six months. Clarke, who has time at Midsummer House in Cambridge and the Ledbury in London on his CV, will offer a £50 five-course menu at lunchtime and an eight-course dinner menu at £95.

Perhaps that’s not the obvious choice for most people, but my father is a Scouser, and since he can no longer speak, there is something about landing in Merseyside, the way people there simply are and the rhythms of their dialect that makes me feel suddenly at home. Even the receptionist at the Pullman just talking me through the hotel breakfast times felt like a cuddle. An hour later, across Albert Dock at the taqueria Madre, I see a man in his 70s out celebrating his daughter’s birthday with his family and staring in bemusement at a table laden with tuna tostadas and baja cod tacos. His splutters felt ever so familiar – they were like my father’s when we tried to take him farther than the Toby Carvery. Of course, as I age, too, I now can’t decide what words were heard in my living room in the 1980s and what were in fact Bobby Grant nagging Damian and Barry in Brookside, because those characters felt for a time like close family, too. Billions have been spent on rejigging and rebuilding the city, and there’s an increasingly vibrant restaurant scene. In fact, a day that involves lunch at Pilgrim on Duke Street, dinner at Belzan on Smithdown Road, with a scoot around Harvey Nichols in Liverpool One Shopping Centre in between is very possibly my favourite leisure day ever. But I never nag foodie people to hurry up and visit the city, because it has a mysterious, uncharted quality that makes outsiders narrow their eyes, say, “It’s nice there? Really? And there are restaurants?” then sail past to the gastropubs of the Ribble Valley or the more lavishly publicised Michelin joints of Ancoats in Manchester. And that’s fine by me, because it means I’ll be first in line for a table at Luke French and Stacey Sherwood-French’s latest venture, Nama, in the new GPO food hall at the new Metquarter development. It also means I’ll be able to get a table all summer long in the suntrap courtyard at Madre and drink their powerful “green wasp” margaritas made with Tapatio tequila, cucumber, coriander, habanero and agave. As Liverpool, like the rest of the country, recently reopened, at first for outdoors drinking only, I heard reports that Madre was thriving, albeit more as a bar than a restaurant. In the months to come, however, they may need to lure back diners, because on the Wednesday I went, now that we can finally eat indoors again, the tables in this Grade I-listed building were relatively empty. Right now, Madre feels more like a boisterous bar with a nod towards the bottles of Valentina hot sauce on each table, but the food menu is nonetheless ambitious, much as you’d expect from the folk behind Belzan and the now-closed Volpi going into a collaboration with the people from Breddos Tacos in London. The tuna tostada, for example, is a fearsome, black plate of sashimi-grade tuna loin marinated to the colour of midnight in soy, mirin, agave and habanero, then topped with an avocado puree and large, roughly chopped slices of green chilli. On the menu, it sounds intriguing, but on the table it needs a more delicate balance, because this is fine fish being bombarded with noise. Baja fish tacos are certainly prettier, with tempura Atlantic cod perched on a subtle jalapeño aïoli and salsa; after a good slosh of that hot sauce, they’re most definitely decent. A large sharing plate of barbecued pit-roasted sweet potato and cauliflower arrives in salsa matcha butter with spring onion and feta. The cauliflower is semi-hard, which makes me think the kitchen is maybe having an off day, but we move on, undeterred, to a large sharing bowl of shell-on prawns on a bed of soft mango and radish and swimming in emerald jalapeño and roast garlic butter. That slick of buttery goodness at the bottom of the plate is the most delicious thing we eat all night; the side of refried beans, meanwhile, is finely pulped and a little forgettable. At this point, I ditch all plans for dinner and order two incredible Café Madre cocktails, made with popcorn-flavoured vodka, Patron XO café, Nixta liqueur and espresso. I have a strict one-only rule with any espresso-based martinis, because one is always delicious and evening-transforming, two always feels like a good idea but is really one too many, while after three there’s a risk that by the end of the night you’ll be plotting a coup in a faraway country. As we leave, the courtyard is in full swing with people laughing and drinking and being together. Right now, Madre is an unmissable cocktail bar where the food has taken a back seat. But it’s fun, it’s definitely open and it’s making many, many Liverpudlians happy. And, right now, that’s about as good as it gets. • Madre 6 Atlantic Pavilion Albert Dock, Liverpool L3, 0151-709 4152. Open all week, noon-10.30pm.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(157,'2021-09-26T05:00:03Z','Erst, Manchester: ‘One of the best meals of the year’ – restaurant review','Erst, 9 Murray Street, Ancoats, Manchester M4 6HS (0161 826 3008, erst-mcr.co.uk). Plates £5-£12, wines from £20 A restaurant menu can be the sweetest kind of promise: we have these ingredients; we have ways to prepare them; what would you like? But they are not straightforward documents. Some menus get it so very wrong. There are those that quietly murder the English language. Things are “nestled” in “symphonies”; there are “trios” and “melanges” and “mosaics”, which make it sound less like dinner and more like an over-catered Roman orgy. Other menus fail by dint of being too long. Surely no kitchen can manage all these dishes, or be fluent in the culinary vernaculars of Mexico, Thailand, Korea, Goa and Dongbei? Then there is the menu at Erst, located amid the blocky red brick lanes of Ancoats, England’s first industrial suburb, not far from Manchester’s city centre. Like the polished concrete floors and the breezeblock walls, the menu is sparse to the point of minimalism. I count just 10 savoury items. One of those is a bowl of olives with pickled chilli peppers. Two of them are bread-based. Another has a line through it. The mackerel didn’t arrive, apparently. So nine dishes. Kind of. Because, as I say, one is olives and two are bread. Less the sweetest kind of promise and more of a shy whisper, perhaps. There’s only one thing to do. We order the lot. The result, in its quiet, unshowy way, is one of the best meals of the year so far; a succession of modestly priced platefuls, which bring on low groans and delicate sighs of happiness. And that’s even allowing for the fact that the olives and chillies are bought in. It starts quietly with a couple of Carlingford rock oysters dressed with a precisely judged spoonful of mignonette, that simple dice of vinegared shallots with cracked black pepper. How very bracing. Erst is sibling to the small group of Trove bakeries, which started in Levenshulme in 2011, and quickly garnered a following for their ways with sourdough. Those baking chops become apparent in a sizeable disc of still-hot flatbread which isn’t flat at all. On the grill it has bulged and expanded, blistered and broken. It is spread with freshly chopped tomato pulp, grassy olive oil and a knuckle-crack of garlic. It is the very best take on that old Spanish stager pan con tomate. It manages to be crisp and soft, sour and mellow all at the same time. It is the best £5 I have spent in a very long time. Alongside it, we have ordered meaty Cantabrian anchovies, floating on their olive oil pond, with a generous dusting of chilli flakes. The anchovies find their way on to the bread. We stop talking to each other, except to mutter: “This is bloody good, isn’t it.” That’s a statement, not a question, and is met with the reply: “Very.” We tell our waiter we’d like another. He reminds us that we’ve already ordered the other version, which comes brushed fatly with garlic herb butter, with a quenelle of bright white whipped lardo on the side. I spread it across the hot bread and watch it melt into the crevices. It’s dripping toast, but as rebooted by Hollywood. It’s the George Clooney of garlic breads: elegant, sophisticated, but with substance underpinning the gloss and shimmer. See how good it is? It’s forced me to type utter blathering, enthusiastic bollocks. We have the thinnest slices of raw sea bass, cured in an acidulated dressing punched up with fermented chilli and decorated with rings of cherry tomato. It’s vigorous and achingly fresh as if it’s only just been fetched from the surf. Next up, a rough-cut steak tartare is topped with a fat dollop of the sauce that’s the key ingredient of vitello tonnato (essentially a mayonnaise blitzed with tuna, anchovies and capers). It is such a smart idea I don’t know why I haven’t encountered it before. In vitello tonnato the sauce lubricates slices of veal. Why can’t it do the same job with steak tartare? For scooping purposes there are shards of the crispest cracker. Both of these plates are £12. We finish this sequence with a heaped salad of finely sliced lamb’s hearts, pink at the eye, with lettuce, grilled green beans and what’s billed as a green chilli sauce. That dressing is a little bullying – and that’s the best I can manage by way of criticism. Because, oh look, here come the fried potatoes. Seriously, look at them: baked potatoes that have then been crushed with force until they are a mess of crevices and edges and folds. Next, they have been deep fried with intent until they are the golden-brown of dry maple leaves in autumn. We break off one bit after another. Somewhere in the middle there might be soft potato. Mostly they are just the thrilling business end of crispness right to the heart. With them is a wild garlic tartare sauce. It is £5 worth of glorious, crowd-pleasing fun. This continues with the desserts which, on that barely populated piece of paper, offer little, but which on the plate deliver so much. There is a bay leaf panna cotta with nectarines. The texture, like the very best clotted cream, is perfect. The flavouring, just a hushabye of bay, is spot on. And then there is a lemon sorbet, a bellow of zest and juice and sugar, served at the point when a scoop melts immediately to nothing on the tongue leaving only the lightest fizz of happiness. Erst describes itself as “a natural wine bar and restaurant”. Our waiter, one of the owners, has noted my recent rant about the offering at Mangal 2. I tell him that my objection is not to low-intervention wines per se. It’s to nasty, cloudy wines that smell of unwiped arse; the ones the truly dedicated natural wine fans seem to celebrate most ardently. He acknowledges the point, and directs us to a lovely crisp, dry Valdibella from Sicily for £30 which has no top notes of latrine. At the end he offers us a glass of a low-intervention dessert wine. It is delicious, full of honeyed tones, dried fruits and the deep waft of Christmas. What matters is not ideology but whether the wine is any good. And with that inside us, what had at first seemed an austere space of glass and stone, of metal and nerdiness, had instead become somewhere of soft edges, warm intent and, most importantly, terrific food. The eerily quiet promise of that tiny, sparse menu has been kept. News bites Every year in November and December, the charity StreetSmart raises money for charities and projects tackling homelessness through the addition of a single £1 (after service and VAT) to each table’s bill in participating restaurants. Last year they raised a much needed £180,000, but that was down from £760,000 the year before, due to the fall in restaurant trade as a result of Covid. At the same time the challenge of homelessness has risen, so they need the 2021 campaign to be a big one. To find out more as a diner or, even more importantly, to participate in the campaign as a restaurant, visit streetsmart.org.uk. And it’s goodbye to the American vegan fast-food chain By Chloe.

They are eating plates of brown butter-poached Cornish turbot with terrines of plump, glazed jersey royals on the side. They’re ordering guinea fowl with celeriac puree and caramelised apple mille-feuille. Each group appears to be catching up with gossip that’s been stacking up for at least 15 months. It’s a spiriting sight. The ladies and gents who seriously lunch are out of the house again. They’re choosing fancy wines and one-upping each other with tales about their grandchildren’s reading prowess or their new garden sprinkler system. Nature is definitely healing, and living well, as those taking advantage of The Barn’s lunchtime set-menu deal are so clearly doing, seems all the more precious right now. The Barn is a lavishly converted outhouse a few dozen footsteps from Moor Hall, a double Michelin star-garlanded restaurant run by chef Mark Birchall. Moor Hall should be on any earnest restaurant nerd’s stop-off list while travelling the M6; it’s just there, being quietly gorgeous and outstanding, a short drive from junction 26. I’m sure, however, that many people opt instead to head on up to the Lakes, which is why so much of the north-west, including the lovely, dining-abundant Ribble Valley, is overlooked. The Barn, you could say, is Moor Hall’s more relaxed little sister who lives next door. It’s a place to eat confit this, pickled that and emulsions of whatever, yet in more laid-back surroundings. Or at least I think that was the original notion. I do smile when very good chefs and their brilliant teams plan to be “relaxed”, because their definition of cool and breezy is often “we have two fewer fork changes over seven perfectly executed courses, but there will still be ornate amuse-bouches, a sommelier and 80 quid hand soap in the loo”. Any chef who has won two Michelin stars bade farewell to the concept of “going with the flow” many, many moons ago. They just can’t do it, because it hurts their heart. Which is why, on any given service, The Barn is like the Bolshoi Ballet performing Swan Lake for Khrushchev. And why I’d been sat down for only five minutes – drinking a “foraged” martini of local gin and overlooking Moor Hall’s dreamy manor house lawns and flower beds, which lead through to thriving allotments – before I was already planning a return. I wish there was more science and skill to being a restaurant critic but, alas, it’s often as primal an instinct as sitting down in a joint and, within seconds, already lamenting the time when you’ll have to vacate this jocund view and these attentive staff who keep bringing glasses of chilled petit chablis, tiny tastes of bizarre, yet delicious dehydrated, smoked carrot slivers that taste curiously of bacon, or warm slices of sourdough and pats of soft, glossy, homemade herby butter. No, no, no, I thought, I deserve to live in a cosseted world where it’s standard to have eight versions of liqueur coffee on the menu and the cheeseboard arrives with a freshly baked dried fruit loaf and small-batch chutneys. On what was, I’d already decided, my first of many trips to The Barn, I started with celeriac poached until soft in brown butter and served in a celeriac broth strewn with pickled apple and walnuts. It appeared arranged in a perfect ring, emitting gentle Midsommar vibes. Charles ate gloriously rich 60-day-aged shorthorn beef with cured egg yolk, tarragon and crispy potato. For mains, we shared, via clandestine plate-swapping, Cornish turbot with an unforgettable warm roe tartare, Sladesdown guinea fowl with pickled leeks and morels and, my favourite, a stuffed, roasted jerusalem artichoke with hen of the woods, white asparagus and pickled pear, which is the vegetarian option of dreams. No sane being has ever stuffed a jerusalem artichoke in their own time; it takes a team of experts in white coats during a long winter lockdown to plot this sort of delicious eccentricity. Pudding was fresh ginger cake with pear sorbet and a light, sweet honey parfait made pretty with oxalis, though, next time, I have my eye on the chocolate namelaka with coffee granita and milk sorbet. I’ve heard that the evening menu at The Barn is a little fancier than the lunchtime offering, but I fail to see how they can push the boat out any farther. Althoughthe restaurant world is precarious right now, it is comforting to know that at places such as The Barn and Moor Hall, the car park is full, the standards are high, the staff are world-class and the till seems to be ringing. Life may never be the same again, but at least there are some delightful, morale-lifting spaces where things came back bigger and bolder and better. • The Barn at Moor Hall Prescot Road, Aughton, Lancashire, 01695 572511. Open lunch Wed-Sun, noon-2pm (Sun noon-6.30pm), dinner Tues-Sat, 6-9pm.

Interviewing celebrities is always a bit of a tussle: they arrive semi-spikily, bearing lists of things they don’t want to talk about, or they don’t want to be there at all, or they’ve been a prisoner all day in a hotel suite, repeating dull anecdotes about their latest project. Many times, the most exhilarating part of any TV interview comes right before the cameras roll. That’s when the audio person asks, “OK, quickly, just tell me what you had for breakfast?” It’s not a real question even; it’s just the time-worn way audio people nudge celebs to make a noise so they can tinker with the sound levels. But it’s the bit I love the most – and the bit when famous people are most off-guard. “Two Creme Eggs … I can never stop at one. They remind me of being a little boy,” one gym-honed British thesp replied. Or, from the mouth of a sylph-like sex symbol: “Ritz biscuits with Primula cheese and Branston pickle. I carry them in my suitcase to keep me sane.” Hang on … what?! Let’s talk about this! For me, these are the real questions. Go-to breakfasts, secret snack concoctions, favourite biscuits and the details of their regular Domino’s pizza order: that’s when you see the real human being. Name-checking a favourite restaurant tells me very little about a person, but you can tell a lot from what they eat behind closed doors. What we eat, in pyjamas, to make us feel comforted, happier, self-soothed or loved is very, very personal. It’s also often a little embarrassing. I cannot, for example, eat beans on toast without a large puddle of bright yellow Heinz salad cream – the full-fat one, not the healthier “light” one; I need my pourable sunshine on full beam. Whenever I’ve started a new relationship, I’ve kept my salad cream habit quiet. Especially with beans. I mean, some people find it abhorrent. But it takes me back to the 1970s, when I was not much more than a toddler, stood on a chair in a kitchen in Carlisle, spreading Heinz sandwich spread – which is essentially just salad cream with bits of chopped carrot and cucumber in it – on toast and feeling ever so grownup. It’s a taste that’s comforted me an entire lifetime. The same goes for Ambrosia rice pudding, eaten from the tin with a big spoon of strawberry jam stirred in. At the end of a long, terrible day, this, on the sofa, is the equivalent of a long bath and a cuddle. As for breakfast, each time I mush up boiled egg in a mug with, yes, more salad cream, to sustain me through deadlines, I’m whisked back to cold mornings before infant school with Terry Wogan on Radio 2 and donating teddies to the Blue Peter bring-and-buy sale. In my weekly podcast, I want to explore exactly this kind of thing: what we eat, how we eat it, and why. I’ve talked to Rafe Spall about his ideal Indian takeaway order, and how it takes him straight back to Friday nights in the 80s with his dad, Timothy. And Russell T Davies made me the snack that helped him through writing It’s A Sin – I don’t want to spoil it, but Cordon Bleu cookery it certainly isn’t. Over the past few months, I’ve spoken to people about their Nando’s order, and Nice ’N’ Spicy Nik Naks, and the whys and wherefores of the Pizza Hut ice-cream factory. Or at least that’s what the chat started off about: we were soon talking about school dinners, first loves, bad dates, terrible auditions, messy break-ups, sibling rivalry and hideous house-shares. Food, you see, is the backing track to all of these life things. By prising the details of secret snacks out of celebs, I’ve gone into the most surprising, emotional places. For the Comfort Eating photoshoot, I wanted to pay tribute to my ultimate soothing snack by filling the bath with deep-fried chipped maris pipers. Yes, as a restaurant critic, I spend an excessive amount of time in posh restaurants, eating fancy, ornate tasting menus. But a real treat for me is crisp, vinegary chips with plenty of salt and, in full acknowledgment of the northern English stereotype, lots of gravy. I’ve tried to leave this penchant behind as I’ve grown older and apparently wiser, but I just can’t quit it. When a cook recently made me Canadian poutine on MasterChef, it was a truly emotional moment. In one bite, I was 15 and foolish again, eating chips out of a polystyrene tray outside a youth club while Blue Monday by New Order belted out through the open doors. Snacks such as these link us to the past and make the present and future feel not quite so frightening. The Comfort Eating podcast is about this. It’s a side of celebrities you don’t normally see, a way to their heart via their stomach. I, for one, will take a story about Findus crispy pancakes or mint Viennetta over their motivation for being a thespian any day. • Comfort Eating with Grace Dent, supported by Ocado, launches on Tuesday 15 June.

This new-ish modern Indian neighbourhood restaurant just happens to be a short saunter from Charles’ south London home, where he flees when he can no longer bear life with me in east London, and particularly my inability to replace lids on jars, my festooning of all flat surfaces with abandoned hair clips and the manner in which I stack the dishwasher so everything ends up “clean”, but smashed and covered in silt. Most relationships benefit greatly from regular bouts of separation, followed by a rendezvous for a good dinner. I noted some time over lockdown that Dayashankar Sharma, the chef behind Grand Trunk Road in South Woodford, was opening a new spot, but then forgot all about it. It pains me how many people’s great business endeavours were trampled by Covid. Restaurants tried to open, then closed, then opened again, and with no chance to gain buzz or momentum. Sharma’s Grand Trunk Road, however, has long been a top tip of mine for anyone heading out to the far east London/Essex borders. It’s a celebration of the foods on offer along the route from Kolkata to Kabul, and is genuinely unusual, with the jackfruit dumplings and applewood-smoked cheese naan being especially marvellous. Sharma is an Indian chef who dances a fine line between high-end, crowdpleasing classics – butter chicken, lamb biryani – and more unexpected delights such as paneer-stuffed figs, spice-rubbed griddled venison or steamed stone bass with shaved fennel. Grand Trunk Road is part of one of my favourite genres of Indian restaurants – namely: fancy, but very much still feeding you until you are sated and woozy. I’ll add to this list the reliably gorgeous and always booked-up Gymkhana in Mayfair and the posh-but-worth-it Chutney Mary in St James’s. Heritage in Dulwich, on the other hand, is presently relatively easy to book and marginally cheaper than both of them. It’s the sort of place to have up your sleeve for a last-minute booking if, for example, you have made your partner spend an afternoon in the men’s holding area outside a fitting room while you tantrum over your resemblance to a Shetland pony in the new season’s leather culottes. And in circumstances such as these, you need an excellent cocktail list serving a Rajwara old fashioned made with bourbon-soaked cherries, bay leaves and bitters, and a Bhojpura Cutting chai mixed from Baileys, chai vodka, masala, cinnamon and saffron. Heritage, you see, is serious about its cocktails, and the outdoor seating area lends itself nicely to a few small plates and a session of getting elegantly tipsy. Instead, we ordered plates of glorious, Goan-style stuffed tilapia coated in semolina and coriander pesto, and an excellent Jodhpuri tawa chicken fried in green spices and served on weirdly moreish mashed potato spiced with tamarind and cumin. Sharma’s creations are available Tuesday-Thursday as a £68-a-head tasting menu, but it’s much more fun to range willy-nilly across the menu and go à la carte. The moment I knew I’d made a grave error in taking so long to get to Heritage was when the humongous, fiercely seasoned, dark crimson shatkora jhinga king prawns arrived, marinated in lemongrass and shatkora, then grilled in a clay oven. I took a photo of these wondrous, bulbous, heavenly super-shrimp, which I keep on my phone and look at during sadder moments in life. Next up came murgh makhani – a smoked chicken supreme cooked in tomato, fenugreek and oceans of cream, which may lead you to think: do I really need the black lentil dal makhani, too? Is it maybe too samey? To which the answer is yes, you do. True, they are of a similar vibe, but they are completely different and both unmissable. Besides, the staff will let you take the rest home packed in charming boxes. Heritage’s Kashmiri lamb is a rich pool of spiced gravy filled with tender, slow-cooked meat of just the right consistency to be prodded and mopped by a sundried-tomato-and-truffle naan. And if you’ve room to move after your third tandoori roti, there’s rose-layered gulab jamun cheesecake with sweet dumplings. This is hearty food that wants to please; sometimes strange, sometimes as familiar as a cuddle. Mixed-generation families sat eating dinner on a Saturday, and both old and young were fussed over by the quickfire, diligent staff. Heritage had a bumpy start, but by rights it should become a south London classic. There are much more hyped restaurants on the food world’s radar, but, sometimes, small and beautiful is really where it’s at. • Heritage Dulwich 101 Rosendale Road, London SE21, 020-8761 4665.

Starters and dim sum £5.50-£8.50, large plates £7.90-£14.80, desserts £4.80, wines from £18.50 A dozen years ago, an editor invited me to go vegan for two weeks, so I could report back from the raucous frontline of plant-based living. I haggled her down to one week and then, after five days, announced I meant a working week, and angrily seared a steak. While the piece took the challenge seriously, and came with a stacked side order of self-mockery, it was also well seasoned with eye-rolling. How funny. Rayner, the carnivore, swearing off meat, dairy, eggs and honey, with hilarious consequences. Let the fun commence. That feature wouldn’t be commissioned now or, if it were, would look grossly out of touch. Even 12 years ago it only just about held on by its fingertips. While I don’t claim to have embraced the lifestyle, only an idiot would ignore the imperative to eat less meat. That said, it’s not always simple. I learned during my five days, for example, that milk powder is the enemy of veganism. I assumed roasted nuts would be my friend. Then I discovered that a huge proportion of products, those enthusiastically flavoured with salt and vinegar, or paprika and roasted onions or black pepper and kumquat (I may have made one of those up), use milk powder to keep the flavourings on the nuts. The first lesson of vegan food shopping became: always read the small print. The other lesson took a couple of days to arrive, like high clouds spilling into a once blue summer sky. I gently found myself falling into the embrace of the Asian repertoire; into a noodle and rice-based menu of dishes drawing on the traditions of Japan and Thailand, India and the various provinces of China. Entirely plant-based food can come from any culinary tradition, but it’s always going to be easiest when there is no compromise; no cumbersome attempt to mimic or replace non-vegan ingredients. Obviously, China loves its pig. Japan just adores its fish. Beware clumsy generalisations. And yet for all that, there really is so much from that part of the world that just happens to be vegan. Bring on the big hitters: those chilli bean pastes and the sesame oils, the misos and the roasted spice mixes, the tofu and the coconut milk. I could do an awful lot with that, and did. So, it seems, can the kitchen at Tofu Vegan, a new Chinese restaurant in London’s Islington from the people behind the much-admired (and non-vegan) Xi’an Impression in nearby Highbury. Its name gives you the basics. Meat and fish are out; tofu and various other bean curd preparations are in. There are cheerleading slogans on both the walls and the waiters’ aprons announcing its virtue, and a chalkboard comparing the nutritional value of eggs and tofu. (The tofu has zero cholesterol compared to the eggs, which are lousy with it. Go tofu!) But virtue is not a serving suggestion, however much some people may pretend it could be. Virtue can literally leave a nasty taste in the mouth, if the person doing the cooking isn’t up to the job. The very best dishes here are those that really are just themselves. There is no animal product that can improve a slippery and crunchy salad of black cloud ear mushroom with a ballast of salted and sliced fresh red chillies, fronds of coriander and a salty and sour dressing, with a big nutty hit from sesame oil. It is the edible equivalent of cold-water swimming. It makes your skin tingle slightly. It makes you feel more alive, which is a serious achievement for a bowl of mushrooms. Dry-fried green beans with more red chilli and lots of ground and fried garlic has crunch and kick. There’s a version of this dish with minced pork, used more as condiment than main event, but this iteration does not feel like its poorer substitute. Cubes of tofu have been deep-fried and come liberally seasoned with salt and the lip-numbing joys of Sichuan pepper, alongside a sweet chilli dipping sauce. Here, tofu really is just a blank canvas for the flavours it carries. But then a lot of these sorts of dishes work that way. I remain sceptical about the idea of vegan faux meats. It has always felt apologetic and unnecessary. Surely plant-based food should be good because of the fact, rather than in spite of it. Still, once you’ve fired a fusillade of salt, peppercorns and chillies at deep-fried chicken it might as well be tofu. Which is exactly what happens with a plate of Chongqing “chicken” with red chillies. There are lots of inverted commas on the menu like this, used for “meats” that aren’t what they say they are. I have eaten the chicken version of the chilli dish many times. I love the childlike thrill of the enforced treasure hunt; of picking through the red chilli and peppercorn rubble in search of the battered and deep-fried nuggets. The fact that it’s bean curd here, makes very little difference to the absorbing pleasure of it. Twice-cooked “fish” cleverly adds a strip of seaweed, full of saline and surf, to the edge of flattened pieces of more bean curd before it is deep fried. It provides a seashore kick. Even with my doubts over nomenclature – we know it ain’t fish – that part does work. The issue here is with the sauce. I have made the double-cooked pork version of this dish at home and know a little about the balance of the Sichuan chilli paste with the sweet flour sauce and the black beans. There’s not enough of that, perhaps because there’s a fear it would make the “fillets” soggy, but it’s still an engaging plateful. I am encouraged by various waiters to have their spicy wonton, which they all tell me is their speciality, and the sauce with that is a belter. Our waiter spoons a little of it over the taut-skinned dumplings, filled with a fine dice of unidentified but crunchy vegetables. It’s a deeply flavoured and inviting bowlful. I could do serious damage to a lot of those. I end up drinking the sauce. I have never hung around in Chinese restaurants for desserts and the two here – sesame rolls stuffed with red bean paste and the toffee-flavoured glutinous rice balls – do not detain me. Instead, we go next door to a branch of the ices chain Amorino. It does a good line in sorbets that also happen to be vegan. I don’t, however, end the evening feeling virtuous. I don’t glow with self-righteousness. I simply feel fed. News bites While most restaurants have reopened since the first lockdown, some have taken their time about it. Among them is the London theatreland stalwart Joe Allen, which is finally doing so next month, and in some style. What was a separate front dining room is to become Joe’s Bar. It will be overseen by Russell Norman, who started his career in the hospitality business with the legendary Joe’s in the 1990s. The drinks list will be big on Martinis and Negronis and there will be a bar snack menu, including the truffled egg toast from Norman’s former restaurant Spuntino. Meanwhile, the dining room has a new executive chef in the shape of Gary Lee, who for many years led the kitchen at the original Ivy on West Street in Covent Garden. His new menu retains many of the Joe’s classics including the Caesar salad and the ribs, but adds the crispy duck and watermelon salad from the Ivy. At joeallen.co.uk. And one other door unlocking delayed by the pandemic: Hawksmoor New York, which had been due to launch in early 2020, has finally opened. The restaurant, on Manhattan’s East 22nd Street, boasts an executive Chef, Matt Bernero, formerly of the Minetta Tavern in Greenwich Village, and a menu of ingredients sourced from nearby, including Island Creek oysters, Maine lobster and Vermont smoked bacon.

Takeaway only, cash only, kebabs £4.75-£9.50. Nusr-Et Steakhouse, 101 Knightsbridge, London SW1X 7EZ (01821 687738), steaks £85-£1,450. A Sunday lunchtime and I am sitting outside a restaurant in London’s Knightsbridge famed for serving a £1,450 steak, eating an £8.50 kebab. I have brought my own table, chair and chequered tablecloth. It’s a ludicrous gesture, but then the Nusr-Et Steakhouse is a ludicrous restaurant, and one stupid turn deserves another. Still, I’m certain that I am eating better than all the customers through the huge wooden doors behind me, spaffing their sticky largesse over gold-leaf wrapped steaks. Because my lamb shawarma comes from the legendary Kebab Kid in Parsons Green, and very nice it is, too. The Nusr-Et Steakhouse, inside the Park Tower Hotel, is the latest opening from Turkish butcher-turned steak monger Nusret Gökçe, better known as Salt Bae. A few years ago, a video of his signature steak salting move went viral. He was pictured in a tight white T-shirt and dark glasses, sprinkling salt down his muscular forearm as if proving he could both season the beef and pop an ovary in one move. Imagine Rod Hull’s Emu, bare naked and disgracing himself by vomiting down his own neck. Salt Bae, which means Salt Baby, was born. He now has 38m followers on Instagram. If you were looking for something to illustrate the male terror of sexual inadequacy, a Salt Bae video would serve beautifully. He wields knives. He likes to be photographed bare-chested. There are now 19 Salt Bae steakhouses worldwide, trading in stupidly expensive steaks, many of them entirely wrapped in gold leaf, flogged to people who should know better. They include David Beckham, Leonardo DiCaprio and the Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro. The gold-wrapped burger is £100. The gold-wrapped eight-hour short rib is £765. There’s the 2kg Tomahawk at £1,450. Finish with gold-wrapped baklava for £50. Shortly after the London branch opened, a photograph of a £1,812.40 receipt for a table of six went viral, including £1.40 cans of Red Bull at £11. Many suggested I should eat there and take the place apart limb from gold-encrusted limb. I declined. This newspaper has better things to spend its money on. In any case, it turned out I could learn an awful lot without ever stepping inside. One afternoon I popped along to get a look at the menu with prices. It’s not on the website, but is available at the restaurant on a QR code. It comes complete with videos of golden steaks wreathed in dry ice, like dodgy contestants in Stars in their Eyes. Tonight, Matthew, I will be a bloody outrage. A woman behind a golden rope was busy telling a solo diner that he could only have his table for an hour. I chatted with a be-stubbled man who had popped out for a cigarette. How much was he spending today? He shrugged. “Three or four?” We’re not talking hundreds, are we? “No, but there are seven of us.” I ask him what his job is. He laughs. “I’m a wanker in finance.” So why is he doing it? “It’s a bit of fun isn’t it? And the man himself is in there.” Salt Bae has 19 restaurants; I wonder how business will cope when he’s elsewhere. Here’s the thing. Some metals are more reactive than others. Never try eating with brass cutlery. Your dinner will taste horrid. Stainless steel is great. And then there’s the least reactive metal of all: gold. Food wrapped in gold will literally taste of nothing, at least at first. Weird as it may sound, I like my food to taste of something. Which is why I decide to get mine from Kebab Kid. It was opened by a Greek Cypriot couple, Cos and Yanni, in 1976 and then acquired by the current owners, the Hatch-Barnwells, a decade later. They changed nothing, save to add a couple of dishes. It is now run by their son Charles who credits his Indonesian mother with the new recipes. It is take-away as cult, especially among London cabbies, which naturally means you’ll find customer reviews online saying it’s not all that. It is all that. Start with the garlicky, deep-fried chicken wings, the meat cut away from the bone so it curls up for easy access. Have the cumin-boosted falafel. The lamb shoulder and chicken shawarma are constructed each day, marinated then grilled on the spit until a deep crusty brown. Any trimmed lamb fat helps fry the hand-cut chips. The salads are crunchy. Ask for a smear of tzatziki. Don’t forget the pickled bird’s eye chillies for punch. Make sure to get a triangle of their deep-filled baklava, made for them to a North African recipe by a former employee. Yours for £3, not £50. Just like Salt Bae, the woman serving me here has a long knife. She doesn’t wait for me to get my phone out before using it efficiently to slice the meat. She also sprinkles salt on the kebab from a shaker, like a normal person who isn’t thinking about Instagram. I eat the wings and the first kebab in my neighbour’s car. Marc has been trying to get me along for years and I can see why. He and his wife Elvira come here every Valentine’s Day to eat kebabs in the car, because romance isn’t dead. I can feel the love. I can also smell Marc’s can of Vimto. He’s only my neighbour; I didn’t bring him up. We take another kebab to the Nusr-Et and I set up the table for my grandstanding gesture. In my more benevolent moments, I wonder whether Mr Salt Bae isn’t actually having the last laugh. Unlike the billionaire Sultan of Brunei, owner of the most recent restaurant outrage at the Dorchester, he didn’t start a rich man. He came from a poor working-class family. Now he’s rinsing the rich and stupid. It could almost be inspiring. There is a 1976 essay on the end of empires by the fabulously named General Sir John Glubb which is instructional here. He posits that empires move from affluence to decadence easily, and then collapse. Sitting at my picnic table holding one of Kebab Kid’s finest, I wonder whether we are now teetering on the edge. After all, as well as tasting of nothing, all that gold leaf will pass straight through the body.

News bites Brad Carter of Carters of Moseley in Birmingham has opened a kebab shop in Manchester. His One Star Döner Bar is part of the Escape to Freight Island food market in the city’s Mayfield district. The venture, based on Carter’s street food experiences in Berlin, began life during lockdown, while the restaurant was shut. The kebabs are made with Cornish lamb and Tamworth White chicken and are wrapped in pide from a Turkish bakery in Manchester. Visit escapetofreightisland.com. Welsh restaurateurs Phill and Deb Lewis, who already have a group of pizzerias in south Wales, have now opened Kindle, a sustainability-led small plates restaurant in Cardiff. It’s located on the site of a former warden’s cottage in Sophia Gardens and all seating is outdoors under covered pergolas. Blankets and hot-water bottles are available. Chef Tom Powell, formerly of the Walnut Tree outside Abergavenny, has come up with a short menu including celeriac bravas, quail with champ and collard greens with coal roasted onions. At kindlecardiff.co.uk. And another sign of how we comforted ourselves through the dark lockdown days of 2020: the pizza delivery and take away company Papa John’s has reported turnover up nearly 30% to £94.9m, and operating profits up 200% from £2.6m to £8m. During the period they opened 20 new stores bringing the chain to 467 sites in the UK. See papajohns.co.uk.

My favourite days to eat in restaurants are Wednesdays and Thursdays, which are closer to Mondays, when staff will last have slept properly. The midweek clientele is calmer, too; elegant, even. Friday nights are for the spewers, the shouters and the firework-between-bumcheeks brigade. Saturdays are for big tables of tossers all paying separately. And Sunday is for a lacklustre “brunch”, offering the normal menu, just shorter and with a £14 eggs florentine, or for a Sunday roast eaten in a room where at least one toddler in a waistcoat needs a lifetime ban. Still, I wanted to try Royale, despite it being open only Thursday to Sunday and serving almost exclusively rotisserie chicken, because it’s a spin-off from another very good restaurant, Leroy in Shoreditch. Setting one’s stall out as an authority on rotating chicken is brave, because anyone who cooks, even moderately, believes they can do this better themselves at home. Chicken is a beginner’s level chance to be swanky. It’s hard to go wrong with a good-quality chicken, a shedload of butter, a strategically placed lemon and a very hot oven. Hell, even I can pull it off. My other half, Charles, meanwhile, being of French stock, makes a terrific Gallic fuss of massaging, precision heating, herb combinations, seasoning dispersal and jointing. At Royale, it’s all about corn-fed Anjou chicken, rubbed with herbes de Provence and spices, cooked on an ancient Rotisol until succulent, with a crisp, brown outer casing, and served with baby potatoes roasted in dripping. See, doesn’t that sound worth leaving the house for? Royale began life as part of Leroy’s pandemic survival plan, delivering chicken door-to-door, but has now taken root in a long, pretty, exposed brick room with an outdoor terrace that is part of the severely underrated East London Liquor Company, which distills and imports an excessive range of gins, rums and so on. That means Sunday lunch here is accompanied by one of those intriguing cocktail lists that one can’t quite help but test out. The Tai Me Up, for example, a heady blend of East London Rarer Rum, peanut butter, sherry, hazelnut and orange liqueur. At this stage of proceedings, Sunday midday, we were almost the only guests at Royale, which was blissful for me, but certainly not great for their profits. I thought of all the other poor souls crammed elbow to elbow in pubs to eat roasts, when here I was in a large, empty space with a menu of plump nocellara olives, warm baguette with aïoli, crisp chickpea panisses and baked rounds of St Marcellin. Chef Lucy Timm is serving a refreshing, simple but delicious spin on Provençal home cooking. Yes, the bird is the main event, but there are also small plates of delicate artichoke on a bed of rocket with shaved parmesan and dressed lightly with lemon and good olive oil. There is a crisp courgette galette with ricotta and basil, as well as sweet, slow-roasted, lush tomatoes with a generous scattering of bolshie, satisfying anchovies, capers and marjoram. Sometimes, I have to admit that the French really do do it better. Service at Royale, just as at Leroy, is relaxed but bright and knowledgable. Not standing on ceremony, but at the same time no one sits on their haunches, squatting down to be at eye level, calls you “guys” and claims not to need a notepad. The crisp, brown chicken appeared on a platter with the potatoes in a puddle of thin jus. The French will never allow themselves fully to enjoy gravy – you can drive from La Rochelle to Strasbourg and never so much as detect a whiff of delicious Bisto – but at Royale I can overlook this. Essentially, it is a good place to have up your sleeve if you need a place to meet a bunch of friends, perhaps even their nicely behaved children or dogs (yes, they allow dogs), to eat simple, non-fussy, south-eastern French cuisine à la bonne femme, while chipping away at the ELLC’s nerdily curated booze supplies. There are few other frills here, which in this era of climbing rents, staffing problems and other post-pandemic hospitality hassles is very sensible. Sometimes, simple is the most beautiful. Eat some chicken and roast potatoes, maybe with a side of crisp courgette frites with fresh basil and a squeeze of lemon. Finish with a slice of homemade cherry and almond tart or, in my case, a slice of decent, pillowy, soft lemon meringue pie, which to my mind is not French at all, but by this stage, I was too incapacitated with food to quibble. Almost nothing good came out of the pandemic for the restaurant world, and we’re still a long way from being remotely normal, but a good roast chicken is a start. • Royale c/o East London Liquor Co, Bow Wharf, 221 Grove Road, London E3, 020-3011 0980.

Small dishes £5-£6.50, larger dishes £8-£11.80, wines from £17.50, Vietnamese beers £4 The train has just heaved itself out of London Euston, when the phone’s ping announces its toddler-like demand for attention. There’s a voicemail. I listen, and feel my heart take the express lift down 20 floors to my needy stomach. The restaurant I had booked for lunch in Manchester, the one this train is now transporting me towards, has been told by NHS Test and Trace that it must close temporarily. Therefore, with regret, my lunchtime booking is cancelled. And so on. Seriously? That booking, the one that’s just been cancelled, was a replacement for the previous one in Manchester that had also been cancelled. I awoke a few days before to a text baldly announcing the fact and telling me to check my email. It turned out they, too, had Test and Trace issues that had forced them, for staffing reasons, to close at lunchtimes. For the sake of doubt my main sympathies here are with the restaurants. It’s your classic, Scream-by-Munch-with-a-side-dish-of-blood-drenched-Carrie nightmare. God, just surviving the lockdowns of the past 18 months has been hard enough. But to reopen only to be forced to close again is a bespoke kind of cruel. Some will argue there is a simple moral to this story: I shouldn’t be travelling to restaurants to review them. On this, I don’t think I can win. Others complain I haven’t left London recently. My view is that restaurants are open, that I am double jabbed, and that I should simply get on with it. Of course, that’s easier said than done, when the restaurants keep cancelling. So let me say that my subsidiary sympathies are with myself. Poor me. As my train barrels through Milton Keynes, I fire off messages to my friends in Manchester, seeking recommendations for somewhere for lunch that is a) noteworthy and b) open and able to take a table for two at roughly 90 minutes’ notice. Which is how I find myself on the familiar walk from Manchester Piccadilly station to the tight knot of streets that makes up the city’s Chinatown. There, just 100m or so down Faulkner Street from the bold flourish of the Chinatown Arch, is Pho Cue. It’s a simple cafeteria space with fake whitewashed brick walls and a fake vertical garden, the restaurant’s name glaring out in white neon from amid the plastic flowers. Say that name out loud. Say it quickly. If you fancy, make a stab at pronouncing “pho” correctly so it sounds closer to “fur”. I can wait. Yeah, I know. Now let’s move on. The owner, Cue Tran, can of course say he was merely putting his first name above the door, but he’s savvier than that. He knows how to work the angles. “I know it tastes good,” he said of their food, in an interview last year with the website Manchester Confidential, when they had just opened. “It tastes like home. It’s not just my name above the restaurant, but the legacy of my family. As long as the methods are there then you bring it up to date and make it look Instagram-worthy.” Pho Cue may indeed be a bright modern presence on Instagram, but it hums with history. Cue’s family escaped Vietnam during the war in a dinghy, joining the other boat people in their search of safety. He was just a baby at the time. Now here is that family making a statement about who they are and where they have come from, one brisk, vibrant dish at a time. In the kitchen Tran is often accompanied by his father and uncle. All the classics are present and correct and all are seriously good value. Small dishes are around £6. Very few of the larger dishes make it into double figures. We see summer rolls, sliced in half and standing to attention in their silky white skins, pass us by. There are deep-fried spring rolls. Both come with pungent dipping sauces. There are, of course, banh mi, those huge lengths of over-stuffed, slightly sweet baguette, a legacy of the former French colonial power now transferred to Manchester. We have soft-shell crab, broken up and lightly battered, in a big, dry mess of onions, garlic, chilli, salt and pepper with just a touch of sugar. It’s a bowl of pow and gosh and “do you mind if I finish this?” The nearest thing to slightly arch innovation is what they call Vietnamese tacos, the wheat or corn flour tortilla replaced by hand-sized deep-fried pancakes, lined with iceberg lettuce then filled with a sweet-sour tumble of fresh tomatoes, bean sprouts, fried shallots and in our case roasted pork. It’s a messy, encouraging handful. Ask for extra napkins. The pho is everything it should be: a huge bowl, steaming with the sort of 24-hour simmered stock that helps you conclude everything is right with the world. Its rich savoury depths are profound and restorative and all consuming. Ours has thin slices of beef, poached from raw in the liquor, along with handfuls of fresh mint, coriander, spring onions and beansprouts. At the bottom is a big old tangle of slippery rice noodles. It is a dish to which you could return time and again. It is lunch by itself and, at £9.30, a damn reasonable one. We have a plate of their crispy pork belly, with crackling like glass and the softest of fat, under a snowfall of sliced spring onions and more golden fried shallots. There is a sweet and vinegary, crisp and crunchy salad of papaya and king prawns and carrots and peanuts. Like so much here, it simply makes you feel like you are being good to yourself. I ask if there is a dessert menu, more out of professional duty than desire. I am told that there is not, so we return to where we began and order a second plate of the soft-shell crab, just to check it really was as good as we thought the first-time round. You’ll be relieved to know it was. Eventually, we down the chopsticks and chase the last fragments around the bowl with a spoon. The widely distanced tables are filled with mostly Asian families this lunchtime all having a very good time. I am no less sympathetic to the two Manchester restaurants where I wasn’t able to eat today. I want them to get back to being fully open as soon as possible. I still want to eat at both of them. But I can’t pretend: I am grateful that happenstance has delivered me here, into Cue Tran’s vivacious tribute to where he started and who he is.

But there is something hard-wired into the British psyche that, every time the sun shines, compels us to run as far as we can to the edge of our island without falling off. And then we eat ice-cream. Or, in the case of Folkestone, we eat gyros, tacos, poke and acai in a ginormous leisure zone called The Goods Yard that lives in a vast car park. Just park up, then follow the scent of designer hot dogs and the dulcet tones of Fat Man Scoop imploring you to Put Your Hands Up. I rather like Folkestone. I love the lighthouse with its champagne bar and the once disused railway track that you can now bumble along again while perusing the Channel. I like the steep, higgledy-piggledy, arty old high street full of independent cafes, craft shops and numerous upcycling and vintage clothes shops. The town is also home to the vastly overlooked Folkestone Wine Company, which sounds a bit as if it ought to be a dusty lock-up owned by a booze importer, but is actually a wonderful restaurant where I had one of the greatest lunches I’ve pushed down my gullet in the past five years. Homemade gnocchi followed by raspberry-festooned, sugary French toast with chantilly cream, since you ask, made in one of those kitchens where it is literally one chef, on his own, making everything as he’d want it himself. The local food scene has fire in its belly. Rocksalt on the harbour is knowingly fancy, with its pretty takes on cockles, whelks and whipped cod’s roe, while well-established burger chain Lucky Chip has opened a branch in town serving the El Chappo and the Kevin Bacon. Dr Legumes, Sole Kitchen and numerous other independents fill up the Harbour Arm, making it nigh-on impossible to visit Folkestone and end up with just a polystyrene box of fish and chips. There are bigger things afoot, too. We headed to the new-ish Basque restaurant Pick Up Pintxos, which serves the likes of txuleton beef rib from San Sebastián and whole turbot cooked in a clasp, as well as a variety of cold and hot pintxos, which could roughly translate as “small, delicious snacky things”, or at least it does when you’re reverberating around the backstreets of Gros, fuelled on buttery Basque cider and txalupa (AKA langoustine). Whether the culture of eating pintxos could ever translate to a sit-down restaurant in Blighty, decorated like a slightly posher Nando’s, is debatable, but on a Saturday lunchtime in August, while all Folkestone’s other dining spots were heaving, Pick Up Pintxos was serving gildas, boquerones and morcilla and membrillo balls, and was very, very quiet. It would help if they had any staff who could enthusiastically sell the concept, or indeed act as if they’d ever been to a restaurant, but instead this was an odd, disjointed experience, with cracked glasses, plates stacked up on tables or whisked off mid-course, 182-month Pyrenean beef served without a sharp knife, and so on and so forth. To be fair, I’ve eaten in several other places that are so bewilderingly run, or not run, of late, not least because staffing issues are dire across the country. But it’s particularly a shame here, because there is some feisty cooking and fantastic produce going on, such as silky, silver-skinned sardines marinated in sea salt and Valdespino sherry vinegar and served in a glorious glut of Arbequina extra-virgin olive oil. The gildas are excellent, salty anchovies stuffed inside plump gordal olives and skewered with ferocious pickled chillies. Chef Gianni Modena has a strong grasp of seasoning, textures and presentation, and I doubt you’ll find a better piece of txuleton in the UK today. That said, one silver lining about the inexperienced staff is that none of them recited the lengthy life story of the cow, which was à la mode in London in 2017, when all Galician beef came accompanied by a traumatic Pixar plot. Charles, who cares little for such sentimentality, took the remnants home with us and spent the night on the sofa resembling Captain Caveman. The turbot, in a truffle and vermouth dressing, was less successful. A beef tomato salad featuring exemplary, meaty, vivid-red fruit was wonderful. Pudding was a forgettable slice of tarta de queso crema, or Basque cheesecake to you and me, followed by a long wait for the bill. After an hour or so in this rather soulless and quite dark restaurant, I was rather keen to go. The place means well and is full of good ideas, but it needs some sort of a reboot. And I empathise because, at some level, don’t we all? • Pick Up Pintxos 2-4 South Street, Folkestone, Kent CT20 1RW, 01303 250544. Open Wed-Sun, noon-11pm (5pm Sun).

Despite everything, the fine British tradition of being busy doing nothing was not to be made obsolete, which was a spark of joy. I missed restaurants, obviously, but while eating out always seemed bound to return in some careful, sterile, heavily planned way, British pubs have never been about carefully laid plans. Their beauty is in their chaos. A pub’s essential essence is fun: now, tonight or tomorrow – no bookings, no time slots, no table service. Pubs are any given Friday, six deep at the bar, jostling cheek and elbow with strangers. Sticky carpets, table swapping, shouting, with some tuneless singing thrown in for good measure. A rotund pub dog padding about having its ears fluffed. No cocktails, although they will do you a Bacardi and coke in a glass with a lipstick mark and no ice. If you stick around until closing, you might even get a snog. Not one of those things is remotely hygienic, of course, but, before Covid-19, worrying about germs was for neurotic sorts in bleach adverts. I took pubs for granted before all the upheaval, but by late spring 2021, gripped by cabin fever, I’d have paid upwards of £100 for a night at the Rat &amp; Parrot with a glass of corked, vinegary merlot and sharing a bag of Nobby’s Nuts with a toothless man while he told me of his trials for West Ham. The Alma, I’ll bet, has possibly seen a lot of this sort of brilliant nonsense in its time. In its spanking new incarnation, however, it is smart, pale, airy and ever so slightly elegant. The Alma has moved with the times, but in its bones, it is still a reliable local watering hole, which is ever so rare these days. Large windows, lots of light draught ales, including the East London Brewing Company’s Foundation bitter and Five Points’ pale ale, both on cask in the garden,and Brick Brewery’s Peckham Session IPA and East End lager (pilsner) on keg. Chef David Yorkston, meanwhile, has crafted a menu many times better than pub food even needs to be, with excellent baked sea bass, jersey royals and samphire on the menu. And a warm chocolate brownie with raspberry coulis and vanilla ice-cream. I’ve now eaten four times in the garden, because I remember full lockdown and this is literally the pub of my dreams. The Alma is in what is known as the Crystal Palace triangle. That sounds like something from Arthur C Clarke’s Mysterious World, but is actually where Westow Street, Westow Hill and Church Road meet, and it’s home to a heady mix of restaurants, independent shops, barbers and cafes. Close by is the well-respected modern European Joanna’s, the pizza place Four Hundred Rabbits and the exceedingly lovely Craft &amp; Courage bar/beer shop, where I recently spent a restorative, silly evening drinking cans of Village’s Soft Suns in their backyard snug. Not one Crystal Palace resident will thank me for reminding anyone that this leafy, interesting, rather homespun postcode is approximately 25 minutes by train from London Bridge and boasts a large, leafy park with sphinxes, a maze and even the occasional alpaca. In fact, I’ll probably get told off for doing so. The queue for cakes at the Brown &amp; Green cafe is already 50-long on a weekend. One local told me that, once upon a time, back in the 90s, The Alma had the comfiest carpets in south London to pass out on. Nowadays, it’s certainly a little more refined – there’s a florist in the courtyard and red quinoa on the menu, for crying out loud. It has pretty, varnished floorboards and a gleaming, brand new foot rest along the bar, which its Scottish landlord Boydy is very proud to point out. The menu is surprising, ambitious and beautifully executed. I love the wonderful fried cauliflower with crispy chilli oil, spring onion and peanuts that I often dream about at night, and the plump chicken wings with homemade naga chilli mayo (they’re not scared of throwing out heat in this kitchen). This is confident, imaginative cooking. I’m well aware that I’m the last person any chef wants to see when they’re running a restaurant out of a yurt in a howling gale, but I’ve kept appearing, as well as ordering Yorkston’s sourdough topped with broad bean and pea mash, whipped tofu and micro-greens, which will warm the heart of any vegetarian. And his tonka bean oat milk panna cotta with Kent strawberries. If this is how pubs are coming out of the pandemic, then there’s definitely light at the end of the tunnel. • The Alma 95 Church Road, London SE19. Open all week, noon-11pm (midnight Fri &amp; Sat).

Yakitori £3-£4.80, other dishes £5-£16, desserts £6-£8.50, wines from £30 Faced by the menu at Humble Chicken, it’s difficult to remain fully adult. One item is listed as “Inner Thigh”. Would you like some inner thigh? Always, love. Always. It adds a special charge to the accompanying offer of breast, tail and soft knee. Would you like some soft knee to go with your inner thigh? Oh, behave. Well, I’m sorry. I can’t behave. I want it all. For while the menu brings out the sniggering schoolboy in me, it is also deadly serious. Seated at the counter of what was once the original outpost of tapas maestros Barrafina in London’s Soho, I watch head chef Angelo Sato tend his grill, hachimaki headband in place. I feel the heart-fluttering joy that comes with the insufferably smug knowledge that I am in exactly the right place. Yakitori is not new to the UK. Lots of restaurants have offered selections of small items, cooked on sticks over coal. I very much liked the burly nature of the London version of Bincho Yakitori (now in Brighton). But Humble Chicken takes it somewhere else: to a place where they speak fluent intensity, furrowed brow and pathological attention to detail. Japanese-born Sato has worked with Clare Smyth in London and at Eleven Madison Park in New York. He has done the precise, furiously tweezered, multi-Michelin dance. With the deceptively named Humble Chicken, in which the dear chicken is lifted far above the humble, he has circled back to Japan. A couple of years ago, on the first night of a family holiday there, we were sent by a clued-up Tokyo local to a backstreet yakitori place. Equally intense young men tended to small sticks of precisely sliced animal over precisely calibrated, smouldering charcoal. It was a revelation. Part of that detail lay in a menu that recognised the different parts of each animal required a different approach. You do not cook pork belly the same way you cook pork loin. The same is true here. Humble Chicken is everything I adored about that humid night down a Tokyo back alley. I have a mantra: authentic is not always the same as good. In this case authentic absolutely is the same as good. At the heart of the menu is a grid of 19 of those skewers, priced at between £3 and £4.80, plus a chef’s choice of five for £16. Other than shiitake mushrooms and meatballs, it’s those cuts of chicken all the way. This evening they have run out of the mixed offal and the liver, which is a disappointment. Sitting kitty-corner on Frith Street from Humble Chicken is a branch of Nando’s, glittering with Pride Month rainbows. I muse on suggesting they pop over there to top up their supplies of livers. Have you tried the Nando’s chicken livers? God, they’re good. No matter. Cubes of thigh, alternating with slivers of grilled spring onion, are seasoned with just a little salt and pepper. Inner thigh gets a glaze of spicy miso and a sprinkling of sesame seeds. Pale pieces of fillet have a nose-tickling punch of wasabi. None of these are dried out by the heat. Crisp seared outers give way to something soft and gorgeous within. They have been cared for. But for me the true joys lie in the bits others might reject. I’m thrilled by a line of four triangular parson’s noses, grilled to a fatty crisp, but still running with juices. I delight in concertinaed folds of darkly glazed and crunchy chicken skin. I am utterly taken by those soft knees; by the squeaky, savoury, salty bounce of the extremity. If you are not a meat eater, nothing I say now will make you sigh with relief and say, “Well that’s OK, then.” But the rest of us should surely applaud both the elevation of the humble and the negation of waste. Certainly, I’m standing and applauding. You can stay seated and be very cross indeed. I understand. Hate me. I have enough love for us all. There are other dishes. While our eyes widen at the menu’s chicken anatomy lesson, they give us a bowl of cool, crisp white cabbage in a sparky soy ponzu dressing. We keep emptying it. They keep refilling it. There’s a single warm oyster in a creamy dressing flavoured with citrus and chilli. Lozenges of cured mackerel arrive, skin side up, in a tomato and ponzu-flavoured jelly with curls of battered and deep-fried seaweed. Thin folds of velvety tuna lie in a puddle of another soy citrus dressing and are dotted with toy-town cylinders of fermented white asparagus. A plate of pickles turns up looking like things raided from the candy jar: there are glossy red crescents of cherry tomato and shiny pink segments of turnip and the pale green of crunchy cucumber. The palate is cleansed. The palate says thank you. We finish the savoury end with two dishes from the section headed “Bigger”. A round of fatty braised pork belly, falling apart with a mere nudge, comes with cured egg yolk and a seed-dotted mustard sauce. Then there’s the crispy chicken thigh, which is simply one of the best rice dishes I’ve had in a very long time. The boneless meat is encased in a square, round-edged envelope of golden batter as if it’s just been fished out of the bubbling oil at a Glasgow chippy. It is shredded in front of me and mixed in with warm rice, which is banging with ginger, citrus and cured vegetables. It is £13.50 of comfort eating, for people too old to call for their mum. Of the desserts, the star turn is the “everything strawberry” cheesecake. It’s a bowl of whipped and sweetened cream cheese, with purées and finely diced fruit and shards of meringue. It’s pretty enough by itself. Then they use a microplane to grate a large frozen strawberry over the top to make an instant granita. Now it’s everything. It’s a huge amount of fun here, side by side at the fat-lipped counter, watching the smoke plume and Angelo Sato lean in over his grill, his face fixed in his version of “death or glory”. Then another dish pops over from the kitchen side and we hunker down into the serious business of dinner. We’ll see a few new openings in the coming months. I may even enjoy some of them. But I can’t quite imagine any of them making me swoon like I did at Humble Chicken. This sniggering schoolboy has to confess: inner thighs aside, in the end it really did turn out to be properly grown up. News bites You wait ages for a serious yakitori restaurant, and then two come along at once. This week also saw the opening of Junsei in London’s Marylebone, from chef Aman Lakhiani. The yakitori menu offers heart, neck and gizzard alongside more standard cuts. There’s also a list of larger plates including citrus soy-marinated prawn with nori and rice, and scallop with trumpet mushroom. Among the desserts is a birch wood-infused crème brûlée. Visit junsei.co.uk. During lockdown 12-year-old Alfred Moisan started sending question-and-answer interviews to leading chefs and people in the food industry. Now, with a bit of help, those interviews have been compiled into a book, called In Conversation With. All profits are going to FareShare, the anti-food waste charity, which supplies many food banks and community food projects. The line up of interviewees is astonishing. Among them are Eric Ripert of Le Bernardin in New York, Ferran Adrià, formerly of El Bulli, Stephen Harris of The Sportsman in Kent and Magnus Ek of Oaxen in Sweden. For more see inconversationwithalfred.com. Oxford, which has never been especially rich in standout restaurants, is shortly to see a new opening with one of Jason Atherton’s head chefs, Chris Emery, at the helm. Alice, named in recognition of Oxford alumnus Lewis Carroll, will be located inside the Randolph Hotel. The launch menu lists trout with Porthilly oyster and charcoal mayonnaise and lamb with asparagus, black garlic and morels.

That’s the fancy term, by the way, for a dining experience that you covet from afar, then map a journey towards, before packing a weekend suitcase to be within thrilling proximity of a big-name chef. No one ever felt like this about the all-day breakfasts at BHS Bournemouth. Or, for that matter, a scone with jam in an M&amp;S cafe, which is generally a self-consoling act after another doomed search for a reliable strapless balconette bra. I’ve long argued that the goths and indie kids of Carlisle bankrupted the House of Fraser cafe by loitering all day discussing Bauhaus B-sides, sharing one 57p whipped cream-topped hot chocolate, before inevitably stealing the mug. However, judging by the lengthy queue of customers standing in Oxford Street waiting to board the special lift to Alto, the mood towards in-store dining has shifted. I noticed this again on a recent trip to Native, which has taken root in the courtyard at the new Browns store on Brook Street. Pop in for Balenciaga sneakers and a Cire Trudon room spray, stay for six courses of fresh and foraged small plates. Alto, once you’ve circumnavigated Selfridges’ fragrance department, which is temptingly close to the express lift, is an almost ridiculously chic affair: a pseudo-Sicilian sun terrace flanked with fake floral displays, real lemon trees, white linen tablecloths and a large menu of cicchetti. It is thoughtfully staged, in the best smoke-and-mirrors sense. On a very sunny Saturday, for those first 10 glorious minutes after I arrived, sitting alone among a fabulous babble of guests and staff speaking mainly Italian, it felt briefly like all the awful stuff that went before – and still festers – was just a cheese dream and here I was on my holidays. This is what we’re asking restaurants to provide right now: not merely lunch, but a sort of Disneyland It’s A Small World experience, whisking us into another place entirely. Alto, it must be said, has this magical kingdom in buckets. The San Carlo group, which owns Alto, is a £60m empire with Italian restaurants in London, Bristol, Leicester, Liverpool, Leeds, Cheshire and Manchester, and bringing a large, established, slightly faceless operator such as this to Selfridges feels a good fit. San Carlo may not be a household name, but it is highly experienced in dealing with tourist groups and the high-end shopping crowd in a way that makes the joint remain chic and efficient. All these smooth Sicilian vibes at Alto will also, hopefully, cushion the blow as you glance through the prices. Cicchetti-style dining, the server reminds us, requires four or five plates between two, and these are all rather small plates indeed, with, for example, a scoop of cep risotto coming in at £15.25 and lemon sole at £11.95, which sounds reasonable, but is very small and is meant to be shared. A goblet of very good, hot, devourable zucchini fritti is £5.80. Two cone-shaped, forgettable beef ragù arancini perched aside roast peppers are £6.85. Even the olives, if you’re choosing them to fill up the table, are just short of a fiver a bowl. I spied several tables of diners hoping to eke out the £12.95 “slider-style” mini-burgers, staring sadly at what turned out to be four gulps of fun. Ah, fancy London prices, I’d forgotten about you. I’ll admit that, back in the old world, I’d grown inured over 25 years of ping-ponging around the capital, emptying my wages and purse-lint into its tills, my skin thickening towards bowls of chips for £5.80 plus service (or, in this case, patatine fritte al tartufo). That said, if you’re in Selfridges to buy your pants and socks when there’s a whopping great Primark over the road, there’s a chance you won’t be quibbling about paying £11 for a small plate of very good, spicy handmade paccheri pasta with a Tuscan sausage and Calabrian chilli sauce. If the cooking at Alto was entirely loveless and cynically marketed towards turning tables to a one-time-only clientele, then the place would be a disaster, but there are flashes of excellence here. And even when things are only OK, they’re pulled off with glamorous aplomb. The plate of fritto misto is a generous, dramatically served seascape of battered calamari, large shell- and head-on prawns, whitebait and soft-shell crab served with tempura tarragon, which is beautiful yet utterly inedible, although after two or three glasses of rosé montepulciano, just like me, you will try. For pudding, we shared a large glass of excellent chocolate and hazelnut gelatos laced with a posh, teeth-rattling take on Ferrero Rocher. I wasn’t complaining: it was the best lunch I’ve had for at least 18 months. I left via the stairs, getting lost in the FAO Schwarz toy department on the fourth floor and stopping for a quick tipsy dance on a piano mat. A Saturday of Sicilian chic, sunshine, daft prices and public silliness. All things considered, I’ll have a bit of that. • Alto by San Carlo, Selfridges, 400 Oxford Street, London W1, 020-7318 3287. Open all week, 11am-8pm (6pm Sunday).

Small plates £5-£12, large plates £14-£19, desserts £7.50-£8.50, wines from £28 If Mangal 2 were located almost anywhere else in London, it would not seem especially remarkable: just another urban bistro with an open kitchen, bare floorboards and a short list of low-intervention wines that could do with a little more intervention. But context matters. Instead, it sits on the main drag in Dalston surrounded by ocakbasi, or Turkish grill houses. The air on the street is heavy with the come-hither smell of rendering lamb and in brightly lit windows, the capital’s very best doner kebabs turn slowly on their skewers, flaunting their curves, as Mail Online might put it, if they ever wrote about food with the vigour they reserve for objectifying people. Once upon a time, Mangal 2 was like its neighbours. It was a Turkish grill restaurant, famed as the place where Gilbert &amp; George would go almost every night for their tea, and more latterly for its gloriously stroppy presence on Twitter. As the numeral suggests it was the second London restaurant from a chef called Ali Dirik, who moved to London from Istanbul in 1987. It is now run by his sons, restaurant manager Ferhat and chef Sertaç, who spent a year cooking his way around Copenhagen, a honey pot for chefs wanting to slice their ambitions open on the culinary cutting edge. At some point during the tumult of the past 18 months, the brothers decided they no longer wished to replicate the menu served by their neighbours. They wanted to be something else. That something else was brought to my attention by Chris Pople, who writes the longstanding restaurant blog Cheese and Biscuits. Pople’s account of his meal there was verging on the breathless. If there’s an opportunity to be winded by my dinner, I’m definitely here for it. It was a very good tip. Again, context is everything. It is the history – what this restaurant once was, what it has now become – which really makes the experience. But even without that backstory, this is still delightful cooking. It draws affectionately on the Turkish repertoire without being afraid of innovation. There is, of course, a lot that draws on tradition. There is hummus, but it’s an uncommonly rugged affair with a hint of cheesy funk. It arrives with a deep well, filled with a seriously peppery olive oil the colour of new leaf growth, which acts less as lubricant than condiment. With it is a round of their lightly blackened, chewy and springy flatbread, with a hot crust that demands to be torn at. We have vine leaves rolled and stuffed with rice, bound with the ocean whack of brown crab meat. It has been given go-faster stripes courtesy of ribbons across the top of a langoustine emulsion, a kind of spice-dusted, turbo-charged mayonnaise. There’s also a cold grilled onion salad – petals of onion layers have been charred and roasted until sweet and woozy. They are dressed with dried herbs reinvigorated by a sprightly, acidic dressing. We finish this series of small plates with a trio of mushroom dumplings, the silky white skins pulled into pleats and filled with a mushroom duxelles of huge depth and punch. Underneath there is a puddle of a yoghurt dressing; on top the fleshy bits of tomatoes, confited to make them most intensely themselves. It’s a plate of serious pre-service commitment and effort. It tap-dances its way on to the table. From the bigger plates we have a pile of expertly cooked lamb sweetbreads. They are a textural joy, hinged between the soft and creamy inside and the crisp and taut outside, propelled by a dark sauce built around the sweet-sour kick of pomegranate molasses. Alongside are large shiso leaves, with their wafty aromatics. They could have felt like interlopers from another menu entirely, but they fit in just fine. A restaurant like this, pulling deeply on Anatolian traditions, needs to feature more of the sheep than just its thymus gland. Sertaç Dirik makes a point of using “cull yaw” mutton from Cornwall. It comes from aged ewes. Just as beef-eaters have realised that dairy animals, with time on the clock, provide the very best steaks, so these sheep are where the flavour is. We have a single chop. It is fatty meat and powerful and rich and won’t be to everyone’s taste. It is to mine. We also have a classic Turkish ezme salad, of tomatoes, onions, garlic and green peppers. It is meant to be finely chopped. Often there is the suspicion it has been blitzed in the processor. Here though it arrives as the finest, most precise dice. It is an ezme salad lifted to a blissful state of elegance. There are just two items on the dessert menu, but both are proper pieces of pastry work. There’s a thin-shelled tahini tart, filled with a velvety sesame caramel. Across the top are whorls of cream flavoured with hazelnut. A classic baba is soaked not in a rum syrup, but one boosted by the more culturally relevant aniseed joys of raki. In an attempt to find something to quibble about, I’ll claim I would have liked the baba to spend a little more time in its syrup bath until completely sodden, but my heart isn’t in it. There’s also a cream with a brilliant sour edge courtesy of Mirabelle plums to wrestle the overt sweetness into submission. It’s delightful. To drink there was indeed wine, of a sort. I’ve already moaned about it, but I’ll do so again. It’s a list written by fans of natural wines so ardent, so committed, they’ve probably been to all the gigs, bought the T-shirts, and then scribbled love letters to them with little hearts to dot all the ‘i’s. A gewürztraminer, at £49, is a whacking 14% and smells of filthy farmyard. It’s cloudy to start and completely opaque at the bottom, like Dyno-Rod had just been in to clear a blockage and wants to show you what the problem was. It also means the cheapest bottle is £28 and much of the list is over £40. It’s odd because food prices, at between £5 and £19 a dish, are thoroughly reasonable. Yeah, I know. I clearly don’t like the wines. Let’s consider you forewarned on that. What matters here is some serious and inventive cooking. The Dirik boys have declined to be hidebound by the traditions on their very doorstep. It’s brave and compelling. And as it happens, properly delicious.

Starters £6.50-£10, mains £13.50-£23, desserts £7.50, wines from £20 If you wanted a single plate of food to symbolise the current state of the gussied-up country pub, you could do far worse than study my main course at what is now the Bradley Hare in the village of Maiden Bradley, a few miles outside Warminster in Wiltshire. It is steak and chips. Except, of course, it isn’t steak and chips; or at least not just steak and chips. The meat is impeccable, in keeping with the noisy commitment here to quality ingredients. They don’t just have a butcher. They also have a game dealer. They say they are against waste and very much for community involvement, so they have a barter arrangement with the local allotment society, allowing them to commission certain vegetables and “botanicals” for the bar. The Bradley Hare has the kind of bar that needs botanicals. I suspect it didn’t when it was the somewhat less titivated Somerset Arms. As to that steak, it arrives pre-sliced, so it’s flashing the pink. It’s atop a bed of rocket and sliced cherry tomatoes. That in turn is on a sturdy raft of sourdough, smeared thickly with romesco, the glorious Catalan condiment of blitzed almonds, peppers, bread, garlic and olive oil that makes almost anything it touches so very much better. A few fried onions are sprinkled across the top because they always help. It’s a serious looker and, more importantly, a joy to eat. The chips are thin and hot and crisp and occasionally skin-on. There will be one constituency that now wants to shout: “See! This is everything that’s wrong with modern, fancy, food culture which won’t leave things well alone. What’s wrong with plain old steak and chips?” To which, in this dysfunctional argument I’m now having with the debating partner in my head, I would reply: “Nothing. But this can be better if it’s done well.” Here, it really is done very well indeed. I’m acknowledging that the Bradley Hare won’t be for everyone, that the pub traditionalists might well find it profoundly irritating. It is worth knowing that a lot of those involved come from the Soho House international members club group. The general manager, Ben Jones, was previously the restaurant manager at Babington House, the Soho House group’s country retreat. A co-director is James Thurstan Waterworth, which sounds like the name of one of those valiant souls who sacrificed themselves during Shackleton’s Antarctic expedition. He’s the one-time European design director of Soho House. If you’ve never heard of Soho House, the mere fact they need a European design director tells you everything you need to know. It is, in short, a glossy relaunch of a country pub, aimed at people who know that the different shades of paint on the walls have fancy names; that the weave of the rugs, and the saris refashioned as throws, matter; that sofas must be squelchy but not too squelchy. Obviously, I am very happy here, for traditional pubs make me feel like I never fully read the pub-going manual. The food follows the model of that steak, for the most part. It is thoughtful and thought about. Cod’s roe is creamed and whipped, but allowed still to be its salty, pungent self. It comes with crunchy, pristine radishes, which are gagging to be pulled through it, and slabs of a warm, lightly oily, flaky flatbread, a little like a paratha, only with daintier manners. There’s a beetroot “risotto” made with swollen jewels of pearl barley and big curls of freshly grated, nose-tickling horseradish. A purée of beetroot has been cooked through the pearl barley, then it’s layered with both chunks and slices of the same in shades of crimson, purple, orange and pink. It is self-consciously beautiful, like some polished 20-something who knows they’ll look just fabulous in any Instagram shot. More to the point, it is a proper flavour-punch to the gob. It reminds me of the classic Jewish beetroot and horseradish condiment Chrain, broken down into its parts so it comes back together again on the fork. It feels a little odd to encounter it here, amid what is part of the Duke of Somerset’s estate. Some would say the same of another main course: cod, with a brown shrimp butter and charred cucumber. It’s a reminder that this is aspirational pub territory, where cucumbers may get charred. After weeks of trudging around, shaking my head at wine lists designed to make people feel as if they were fools for even thinking of going out to eat on a budget, the one here deserves all sorts of hosannas. The choice is broad without being exhausting, but more importantly it opens at £20 a bottle and about half of it is under £35. Much of it is also available by the glass and carafe. It’s a list written by people who want you to have a nice time. Then again, the place is engineered for a few days away rather than just a one evening stand. There are a dozen bedrooms and an associated spa in the village, also staffed by people formerly of Babington House. A couple of days after my visit, their PR emails me to say that the head chef, whose name was trumpeted on the website at launch (and who, at time of writing, is still listed), had parted ways with the business a couple of weeks before. That may explain the slump at the sweet end of the meal. A raspberry puff with gin cream is a millefeuille nobody could be bothered to construct. There’s a hillock of juniper-flavoured whipped cream, a few raspberries, and some triangles of pressed puff, artfully positioned. It is an idea, unfinished. A brown-butter crumb with strawberries and clotted cream is a nice thought, underwhelmingly executed. It’s dominated by that under-sweetened over-salted biscuit crumb. Throw in more sugar and perhaps a few crushed ginger snaps and it might well be a dessert. Right now, it’s a waste of calories. Along with a choice of Brickell’s ice-creams, it feels like a dessert list specifically designed to make service more manageable for the kitchen, rather than to please the punters. That glum note undermines the headline news: here amid the Narnia wonders of Longleat Forest an old pub has been taken over, brushed up, sanded down, painted, varnished and turned into an extremely civilised retreat from a world that, frankly right now, deserves to be shunned occasionally. This version of the pub may well drive certain people nuts. I suggest they go hang out somewhere else. News bites The much-loved JoJo’s, overlooking the sea in Tankerton just outside Whitstable, has launched a Crowdfunder to secure its future. The freehold of the whitewashed wedge of a building which houses the Mediterranean-cum-tapas restaurant, is for sale. To help buy it they need £100,000. So far, two-thirds of that has been pledged, in return for various rewards and inducements: a supper cooked by chef Tom Kerridge and hosted by Suggs of Madness is already fully subscribed, for example. But there are still others available in exchange for your dosh, visit crowdfunder.co.uk/save-jojos. It’s a cautious, wide-eyed welcome to The Top Hat, a new restaurant on London’s Tottenham Court Road themed around the board game Monopoly. Cocktails reference different properties on the London board and you can ‘Take a Chance card’ when ordering drinks.

It sits alongside Monopoly Lifesized, an attraction which offers a chance to play a scaled-up version of the game.

Starters £4-£9, mains £13-£19, desserts £6, wines from £18 There is no glittering river running down the middle of Raleigh Road, in Bristol’s Southville district. There are no Arctic snowfields of white linen dressing the tables. The dining room is not polluted by braying parties of media plutocrats of a sort that might make even the most ardent pacifist think ugly, violent thoughts. As a result of these things, the prices will not quite make you wince, like someone has poked a vinegar-dipped finger into a recently incurred wound. Or to put it another way, no one would look at the humble, whitewashed space housing Sonny Stores, on a corner in residential Bristol, and mistake it for the famed River Café. Until the food starts arriving. And then: oh my. Gosh. And thank you. The comparison is not overly contrived. The chef, Pegs Quinn, spent five years cooking at the River Café in Hammersmith. He learned how to make the silkiest of pastas. He learned the supple, subtle ways of the wood-fired oven. Bristolians who care about their dinner, and the city’s thrilling independent restaurant sector suggests they are many, should give thanks for what he learned there. All of it, and more besides, is now here. After his stint by the Thames, Quinn brought those pasta skills to Bristol, cooking first at Bianchi’s and then at its sister restaurant Pasta Ripiena. During lockdown, Quinn and his wife Mary Glynn ran a sourdough pizza company from home. Last year they took over this corner site and turned it into an Italian deli with a few tables. They called it Sonny Stores after their son. Now it is solely a restaurant with a blackboard menu that changes throughout the week, space for 16 inside and a covered deck outside for a few more. It is a sunlit spot of big picture windows framing people leaning in eagerly over plates of food, amid the solemn silence of so many closed front doors. I find myself wondering whether those who live across the road are irritated by the tides of chatter that must sometimes rise towards them, or are overjoyed by the brilliant eating opportunities now on their doorstep. I hope it’s the latter. We start with a plate of silvery-backed and salted Calabrian anchovies, swimming in the best peppery olive oil, a little acidity and sprinkled with dried oregano. Our waiter tells us she filleted them herself just before service. I appreciate the detail. I take a photo and afterwards thumb it on my phone. The plate reminds me of those oil paintings capturing the essence of the good things in life through simplicity, something perhaps by Euan Uglow or Ffiona Lewis. (Do look them up.) These are not tiddler anchovies, those brown stripes on a plate coyly curled in on themselves, apologetically. These are butch, muscular specimens. They are the Schwarzeneggers of the anchovy world, from the period when Arnie was in his posing pouch down on Muscle Beach, pulling all the shapes and loving himself. They come with Jenga hunks of thick and still warm toasted bread. Rip off the crusts. Add a fat hit of savoury saltiness. All is so very good. A bowl of crisp little gem leaves becomes so much more than just a side salad via the addition of oily and salty roasted marcona almonds, slivers of finely sliced Amalfi lemon and a blizzard of freshly grated parmesan. This salad isn’t just dressed, it is catwalk-styled and accessorised. It’s a star turn for £9. Clearly the kitchen isn’t merely unafraid of big flavours. It’s thrilled by them. A pearly piece of monkfish, bronzed at its leading edges, comes with roasted fennel and the sweet explosions of datterini tomatoes, their skins blistered and blackened. Across the top is an anchovy pesto. When the plate is cleared, which it quickly is, there’s a mess of juices crying out for the rest of the bread. Spaghetti with bite and slurp comes piled with finely chopped mussels and tomatoes cooked down in white wine, which leaves its own powerhouse of moppage. These dishes cost £19 and £13 respectively. It’s a very fair price for stacked platefuls. The kitchen’s origins in pizza-making are still represented. The £15 price tag feels chunky for the bianco, made with béchamel and prosciutto and a fennel pesto, but then it arrives. It’s a chunky bit of pizza. The sourdough crust is bubbled and blistered, and provides yet more bread options for sauces that may have been left behind, but which must not remain so. A bottle of gavi di gavi from a short list with real choice below £30 stands up well to all this overt muscularity. And now I am babbling like a love-struck teen, but it is all so very babble-worthy. Usually with menus this punchy, the ball is dropped somewhere. But no, here comes dessert, and the balls are all where they need to be. There’s an immaculate Amalfi lemon tart with a crisp biscuity shell and the requisite zing. There is a smooth, soothing, pillow of tiramisu. Best of all, there’s a crisp-chewy meringue with poached white peaches and dollops of crème fraîche. It is a dessert of pure sunlight. On the way back from the loo I come across our waiter who is discussing a matter of great import with Quinn, through the hatch into his kitchen. She turns to me. “How do you spell meringue?” I laugh and say, “Well, I suppose I have to be useful for something.” I give her the spelling and then tell Quinn his meringue really was perfect, however they might spell it. Meringues are one of those things that are easy to do badly, but hard to get absolutely right. They get things absolutely right here at Sonny Stores. Let me record my gratitude then, to the Bristol-based food writer and restaurant maven Mark Taylor for pointing me in its direction. I leave with a surge of jealousy. Behind all the surrounding front doors are people who can pop over the road for a plate or two here any time they like, funds allowing. Sure, we all need convenience shops, but why not convenience restaurants? Why not this convenience restaurant? I shouldn’t be surprised it’s here, of course. This is Bristol where they have nailed the business of the small but perfectly formed independent. No grandiose, surging rivers. No acres of linen. No plutocrats. Just great food, done really well. News bites The pandemic has been a driver of innovation in the hospitality business and it’s clear some of those innovations will continue as restrictions are lifted. Lake District chef Simon Rogan has announced a relaunch of his seasonal three-course-meal kit business, in collaboration with the company behind Lakes Cottage Holidays. One of the £45-a-head menus for August, available across much of Britain, includes stuffed shoulder of Herdwick lamb with grilled courgette and wild garlic, and chamomile sponge cake with gooseberry and sheep’s yoghurt. Other businesses continuing the meal kit model in the English northwest are the boutique hotel Northcote at Langho, and chef Gary Usher’s Elite Bistros group. Visit simonroganathome.co.uk. The Clink charity, which runs restaurants and catering businesses inside prisons to provide training, qualifications and experience to inmates, has received a chunky commitment of £6m over three years from the Julia and Hans Rausing Trust.

All bookings announced on Instagram @kurisuomakase. Dinner £108 It is eight o’clock on a dark April evening and I am hunched over my phone, trying to beat the invisible hordes. I had set myself an alarm for this moment, and now I’m going for it, speed running the dialogue boxes for name, address and all the rest. Finally, I click confirm and allow my phone the electronic deep breath of a refresh. There it is: I have two seats for dinner, over three months hence. I’m in. I’m shocked by myself. This isn’t me. I let other napkin-sniffers, desperate to be first through the door of the next big thing, behave like this. I’m much cooler. Or perhaps not. Odder still: the two seats I have reserved are inside a humble restaurant 12 minutes’ walk away from my house on Atlantic Road in Brixton. It’s called Ichiban Sushi, and opened in 1999. My family went there for years when the kids were small, for comforting rice bowls, sturdy nigiri and more than punchy Thai green curries. The latter was not quite the outlier it might seem. Ichiban is owned by a Thai-Colombian couple. Sometimes at weekends, the food would be brought to us by their bright-eyed 10-year-old son Chris, helping out with the family business. It turns out that Chris Restrepo was doing more than just fetching and carrying. He was soaking up the intricacies of sushi. He was, he says now, finding a direction in life. At 16, he started in the kitchen. He ate his way around the best sushi restaurants in London and later went to Tokyo. He secured a place at the prestigious Tokyo Sushi Academy. He was ambitious. Now 28, he wanted to bring something back. That something is Kurisu Omakase, Kurisu being Japanese for Chris. It is a sushi tasting menu served twice nightly on Sundays and Mondays when Ichiban is closed, to eight diners. I heard about it from my friend the chef Tim Anderson, who has the ramen restaurant Nanban elsewhere in Brixton. But word has also got around. Endo Kazutoshi of the revered Endo at the Rotunda turned up one night, as did some of the crew from the Araki. Serious chefs are coming down to see what Restrepo is up to. With good reason. I’ve eaten at the fabulous Endo. I’ve splurged at Umi and purred over Sushi Tetsu. I do not hesitate to say that what’s being served here is some of the very best sushi in the UK today. Yes, there’s oceans of technique on display, but there’s so much more than that. There is character and narrative and wit. Restrepo is chef as story teller. The old tables where once we were served those Thai green curries, are pulled around to form a low counter. He takes up position on the other side with his brazier of glowing coals, his blow torch, sauces and, of course, his blonde-wood case of fish. In a neat reversal it is now his mother, Suwannee, who fetches and carries from the back kitchen. Just as Restrepo welcomes us, a bloke sticks his head through the front door and barks a friendly greeting at Suwannee. Restrepo shrugs. “It’s Brixton,” he says, simply. The occasional blue light will flash by. There will be raucous laughter from the street life of the pavement outside. Meanwhile, inside, we are being taken by the hand. It begins with pale pink slices of tuna. Like most of the fish it has been aged to give a denser texture and to deepen the flavour. The tuna has been seared. There is a puddle of a brisk ponzu dressing and a shower of parmesan for boosted umami. Next, he tells us, there must be a fried course, for he is following a formal order. It’s a golden croquette of white and brown crab meat. In a nod to his Thai heritage, it sits on a thick green pond of a sweet-sour nam jim sauce. This trio of openers concludes with a miso-slicked piece of hamachi seared on the brazier until bubbling and brown, with a fan of tempura-ed enoki mushrooms, a shredded radish salad and a ginger dressing. Now he presents the blonde-wood box containing a dozen types of fish. We watch the delicate jeweller’s hand movements, the rice scooped and shaped by warm fingers and palm, slicked with water between portions; the wasabi dabbed just so; the lozenge crowned with a curl of pristine fillet. He places each directly in front of us. The rice is just above room temperature and lightly vinegared. Some of the fish is brushed with soy. There is the hiss and pop of the blowtorch. Sometimes the brazier is used to sear the fish. At one point the coals are used directly. It is both dinner and theatre. Each of these tiny, jewel-like courses comes with notes. The caviar comes from Exmoor; the farmed bluefin from Spain. Some fish comes from Brixham. Provenance matters. Between supplying this vital information, Restrepo tells us tales: of how he was refused access to restaurants in Tokyo on account of his tattoos, which signified gang membership; of the unsubtly racist divide between the Japanese students at the sushi academy and those from elsewhere. It would be repetitive to list all the nigiri, but there are highlights: a cross cut of crimson tuna, half fatty belly, half loin with a dollop of truffle mustard sauce; a seared trout belly with a Thai basil miso so aromatic you could dab it behind your ears; sweet pristine langoustine, the very essence of the sea, with nam jim. Scallops are scored 18 times so the surface opens out. “It’s called the Houdini cut because it disappears on the palate,” he says. Finally, he makes temaki rolls: seaweed cones of rice and the very best tuna tartare. “Here,” he says, handing it from his hand to mine. “Have a tuna spliff.” The £108 price tag is hefty. Add on sake and it will be heftier still. But compared to similar offerings in London it can only be classed as good value. Plus, we should all beware cheap sushi. Restrepo has other residences around London, but later in the year he hopes Ichiban will become his permanent home. Suwannee will also serve a Thai tasting menu a few nights of the week. All the new dates are announced via his Instagram account, @kurisuomakase, and go very quickly indeed. Yes, I know. It’s all terrifyingly competitive. Just do what I did and set an alarm. It’s so very worth it. News bites I’m lucky enough to live in a part of London where I can order take-aways from Dishoom. Oh, the buttery joys of that house black dal. Now, after the cult success of their bacon naan kit, they have launched their first at home meal kit for delivery across much of the UK. The Home Feast box feeds two to three people, costs £60 and includes that dal, as well as lamb sheekh kababs, mattar paneer, murgh malai, rotis, lassi, and a gulkand mess to finish. Visit store.dishoom.com/home. Pie maestros Calum Franklin and his second in command at the Holborn Dining Room Nokx Majozi are joining forces with Matt Brown, exec chef of the Hawksmoor Group for the annual dinner to raise funds for the charity Action Against Hunger. They’re staging a five-course feast at Hawksmoor Guildhall in London on 2 October. Tickets are £150. This is the ninth such event. Over the years the dinners, which feature both a live and silent auction, have raised more than £625,000. Newcastle chef Kenny Atkinson has taken to Instagram to announce a new restaurant for the city. Solstice will be a sibling to Atkinson’s House of Tides which opened in 2014 and has held a Michelin star since 2016, the only restaurant in Newcastle to do so. Apart from the name, Atkinson has given no further information.

Book online at the-gpo.co.uk. All dishes across the menus £4-£16. Wines from £18 The app wants to be reassuring. Yes, of course I can have half a fried chicken with hot sauce on a thick slice of bread with pickles. As long as I am in Sheffield. I’m not in Sheffield. I’m in Liverpool, in a booth within the polished redevelopment of what was once the city’s General Post Office building. It is baffling. The app is meant to be the best way to unlock the offering at this food hall with its many outlets and gracious table service. Now it has taken me all the way through the process before telling me I am 78 miles away from my order. This is a profound tragedy, albeit only within the narrow parameters set by a restaurant critic’s nightmarish entitlement. The GPO Food Hall in Liverpool is a great idea. Unfortunately, a great idea is not always the same as a great night out. At least not yet. There is the potential for one here; it just needs some fine tuning, and maybe one of those stern meetings at the app developers’ office to which no one brings Danish pastries because that would undermine the seriousness of the message. Statement of the bleeding obvious: this model of eating out is not aimed at grey-bearded, artificially hipped old sods like me. It is for those younger people with tighter budgets and rising hormone levels, the ones who do not want to be constrained by a single menu; who wish to roam bits of China while one mate spanks the burger list and a third goes all Middle Eastern. You’ll find examples of it at Seven Dials Market in London’s Covent Garden and Escape to Freight Island in Manchester. They are dynamic and frothy and bloody noisy ventures. And now I sound like somebody’s cringy dad trying to pretend I’m well into the latest hot Vocaloid track. (You’ve never heard a Vocaloid? You lucky bastard.) The GPO Food Hall offering has been put together by the Milestone Group, which cut its teeth with the Cutlery Works in its home town of Sheffield. In Liverpool, alongside Jailbird fried chicken, it currently includes the restlessly pan-Asian Konjö, the Middle Eastern MorMor, Patty B’s Burgers, Chit ’n’ Chaat (kind of) representing the Indian subcontinent, Torito Tacos and Ice Desserts, for those who never really liked their pancreas anyway. There are also a couple of bars and a coffee place. The redevelopment that houses all this has tried to pay homage to the post office heritage of the building even though, awkwardly, GPO apparently now stands for Global Provisions Outlet rather than anything to do with failed next-day delivery. Still, it allows them to use versions of the original logo. There’s something close to wooden pigeonholes behind one of the bars for the liquor collection, and I very much like the ridged frosted glass that tops the backs of the leather booths. It’s all a step up from the refectory tables usually found in these places, though other seating has a touch of the airport Hilton about it. For all the careful design work, there is the unavoidable sense of eating in a shopping mall. Diners will just have to bring their own atmosphere. You are encouraged to order everything through the web-based iBeLoyalty app. The food is then delivered to your table. Which is where it all goes tits up. They desperately need a gateway inviting you to choose your venue. Without one, you end up scrolling through dining options in Sheffield, Wakefield, Leeds and Castleford, searching for something relevant. Some restaurants are duplicated which, as I’ve already said, means that only at the end of the process will you discover the location you are in can’t serve you. Convene the damn app developers’ meeting immediately. Hold the Danish pastries. But eventually we did get to order. For the most part this is flavour-bomb food, designed to slap you in the face and slap you again and again. None of it is subtle or carefully crafted. What we get are a set of sturdy, reasonably priced dishes, better versions of which can be found elsewhere, but not all in one place like this. Very few cost more than £10. From Konjö there is a workmanlike crispy chilli beef, full of crowd-pleasing crunch, fire and sugar. Their Korean cauliflower, first battered and deep-fried, then slathered in a sugary gochujang-based sauce is OK, too. Come here very drunk, at that point where the sensation of your tongue clicking against the roof of your mouth is hilarious, and you’ll like these a lot. Curiously, a side dish of kimchi is very good indeed: punchy without being astringent. Of the outlets we tried, the best by far was the Middle Eastern MorMor. Granted, you’ll not find harissa spice-dusted Padrón peppers anywhere on the road between Alexandria and Amman, but they were vibrant and punchy. Equally, chargrilled lamb kofta, piled on to blistered flatbread laid with hummus, crunchy salads, pickles and the like was a satisfying plateful for £10. We got exactly what we deserved for ordering a chicken dosa pizza from Chit ’n’ Chaat. Instead of a lacy fermented rice-batter pancake, we got something with the thickness of a foam innersole, crusted with devastated pieces of chicken. It looked like an unfortunate pavement incident after closing time. Undeterred by the app, I walked over to the Jailbird stand to order. The nice chap told me apologetically they’d run out of everything apart from wings. Six of those, please. Oh dear. They were greasy and, like me, slightly bitter. In the circumstances, the Nutella and Ferrero Rocher sundae ordered from Ice Desserts was less pudding than a cry for help. It is what it is: dairy fats, cheap chocolate and sugar in a glass. That’s not a criticism. I liked the crunchy, nutty, sugary bits at the bottom. That may have been the cheap sauvignon blanc talking, because once we’d got the app working, service was swift and friendly. We could have ordered a £195 bottle of Dom Perignon. We didn’t, but we could have. It’s just proof that they’re trying to work all the angles. A special word for the unobtrusive playlist: Earth Wind and Fire, Prince, Barry White. It’s boisterous and fun, which, when it gets its act together, the GPO could be, too. Jay Rayner’s new book, Chewing The Fat: Tasting Notes From A Greedy Life, is out on 2 September.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(178,'2021-07-18T05:00:21Z','The Double Red Duke, Oxfordshire: ‘It’s a class act’ – restaurant review','The Double Red Duke, Bourton Road, Clanfield, Bampton, Oxfordshire OX18 2RB (01367 810222). Snacks and small plates £7.50-£16, large dishes £12-£35, desserts £9, wines from £27 Later, I would think of it as the redemptive scallop; as the bivalve that made amends for the tragically broken promise of the one that had gone before. Then I would hate myself for allowing the ludicrous phrase “redemptive scallop” into my head. At the time, though, all I thought was: “Damn, there are three of them. That means I have to share the other one. Why, God, why?” It came on the shell, under a thick drift of crisp, golden breadcrumbs which in turn had been drenched gleefully in wild garlic-flecked butter. The scallop had been cooked to a glossy mother of pearl within, and there, like a showily tinted comma from an illuminated manuscript, was the brilliant orange of the coral. Eventually, I took to scraping at the ridges of the shell for the crusty bits. There were many crusty bits. The one that had gone before was served to me at Gridiron, at London’s sleek Metropolitan Hotel. On the menu it read impressively: “Wood-roast scallop with smoked roe and paprika butter.” What arrived was limp, underpowered and apologetic. The link between these two starkly different scallops is the same consultant chef, Richard Turner, also executive chef of the Hawksmoor Group. At the time I concluded Turner’s gutsy shtick simply didn’t work amid the sleek white lines of the Metropolitan; that the environment demanded a certain ungainly Gucci-ed poise that didn’t fit his full-fat approach. (Gridiron has remained closed since the start of the first lockdown.) But I am nothing if not an optimist. One of the new ventures to emerge out of the most recent lockdown was the relaunch of the Double Red Duke, a handsome honey-stoned pub in that part of Oxfordshire where nothing bad has ever happened and nobody has ever farted, or even thought of doing so. It has been added to a small but growing portfolio of country pubs run by Sam and Georgie Pearman, who made their name overseeing Cheltenham’s always reliable Lucky Onion group. Early on, Turner was announced as consultant chef with one of his Hawksmoor head chefs, Richard Sandiford, installed in the kitchen. When I visited they told me Turner was no longer involved, though the menu is the same as the one they touted when he was attached. It is smeared with his animal-fat finger prints. Surely it had to be worth a drive up the M40? It is. And for that matter, down the M6 to the M42 or along the M4 and up. Or train it to Oxford and splash out on a cab. You get the idea. The Double Red Duke is worth the trip. Inside the sprawling pub is a network of interlocking, low-ceilinged rooms, at the heart of which is an open kitchen full of live-fire grills, edged by a wide counter. Book a seat there, then stare into the embers and think about where your life went so right. Or make for one of the foliaged dining rooms with their plump green banquettes and the odd rust-coloured sofa, of a sort a food coma might pin you to at the end of the meal. The kitchen under Sandiford seems committed to getting the named dishes right, rather than reinventing the wheel, to give it unwanted corners. The closest thing to innovation is a brilliant green broad bean mash with garlic, lemon, tahini and olive oil, drizzled with chilli sauce, though even that is hardly revolutionary. Hummus, made with broad beans rather than chickpeas, turns up all over the shop. It’s a dollop of punchy loveliness and comes with heat-blistered flatbread straight off the grill. Those breads demand to be torn apart and sniffed deeply before being put to work. Then there are the devilled kidneys. Oh, the devilled kidneys. I order them regularly, more in hope than expectation. Often it feels like one of those recipes that, over the years, has become a faded photocopy of itself. Here, the image is crystal clear. The generous pile of plump lambs’ kidneys for £9 still have a blush of pink at their heart. The deep pond of sauce, soaking into the slice of sourdough beneath, is the rich, sticky, cayenne-spiked wonder it should be. Anthony Trollope, who referenced them in his novels, would nod approvingly. Unsurprisingly, given the Hawksmoor DNA, steaks are at the heart of the menu: prime rib, porterhouse and T-bone with sauces many and various, including the anchovy-boosted wonder that is Gentleman’s Relish. Prices are a good 25% lower per 100g than Hawksmoor’s. Alongside those, there’s both a whole turbot, and a sturdy 350g cut cooked on the bone for £35. It is a terrific piece of fish shown due care and attention. The only down note of the meal is the tub of lemon ketchup accompanying it. Calling it ketchup doesn’t change the fact that it tastes like lemon curd; a rather good lemon curd, but lemon curd all the same. It’s not the condiment this fish needs, or any other fish for that matter. I have £18-worth of thick veal chop on the bone, topped with deep-fried oysters and a big mess of tartar sauce sprinkled in turn with the vivid orange of egg mimosa. It is all delightfully on point. We order salt and vinegar dripping chips, because it would seem rude not to. They are everything you might wish them to be: properly crisp, rustling against each other like dried leaves in autumn, sprightly with vinegar. The fact I do not have space for them, that I am forced to leave room for dessert in your service, makes me sad. You ask too much of me sometimes, you people. There’s a bowl of steamed spinach to make us feel virtuous. Desserts at £9 include a sticky toffee pudding and a white chocolate cheesecake. We share a strawberry ripple sundae, and it is all the gleeful, childhood seaside things those three words promise. We fight each other for the ribbons of icy strawberry, striating the vanilla cream. Outside, beyond the car park, is a set of newly built rooms, in golden Scandi shades of wood. I find myself imagining coming here for the night, letting the kitchen do their thing, and then stumbling across to bed. The menu at the Double Red Duke reads as an unfussy version of pub food. It even includes a cow pie. But the simplicity of the words on that page barely begin to tell the story. It’s a class act, redemptive scallop and all. News bites Given my modest sideline as a pianist I am always going to be a cheerleader for anything that brings music and food together. So it’s a delight to welcome The Parlour, a plush downlit space within the restaurant and bar complex that is The Ned in the City of London. They are investing seriously in live music, to go along with the New York supper club vibe, from top players like pianist Reuben James and clarinettist Giacomo Smith and his band. There’s no cover charge for the music, or at least none that’s obvious; let’s just say the cover charge is tucked away in the prices for the menu of American bistro classics. It’s no one’s version of cheap but the dishes, like the music, deliver. It is a very good night out. It’s all change at Edinburgh stalwart The Little Chartroom. In September chef Roberta Hall-McCarron and her husband, Shaun McCarron, who runs front of house, are relocating the restaurant to a new, larger site on Bonnington Road. Meanwhile the original site will become Eleanore, a wine bar serving a menu of small plates, including BBQ pork neck with chicory and quince and oysters with fermented cucumber, sweet pickled apple and horseradish oil. See thelittlechartroom.com. And completely unsurprising news that’s still worth reporting: the food delivery company Deliveroo has reported orders in the UK and Ireland, up 94% in the second quarter of 2021 to 38m.

Well, no such luck. It’s alive and well, and I’ve had a banana-flavoured old fashioned and some monkfish yakitori to prove it. That said, I do understand why people feel so strongly about this area, which has been a magnet to the young and wilfully edgy for almost three decades now, because they can be exasperating and are very definitely laughable. In fact, the word “Shoreditch” itself has become a punchline of sorts, and the cause of much groaning and eye-rolling. Such things are hard to shake off. This has continued long after the luxury Nobu Hotel Shoreditch opened and the YBAs had grandkids and moved to Hastings; in fact, long after anyone genuinely edgy or creative migrated to Dalston or Haggerston, or the north or Berlin, or, in fact, anywhere with WiFi. Yet even all these years after Nathan Barley, whenever I review a place in Shoreditch, the comments still fill with the likes of “Keep it foolish” and “The rise of the idiots”, because some things will never die. If anything, The Light Bar is egging them on, with a cocktail menu that pays tribute to ye olde Shoreditch, and Sean McLusky’s club night at 333, to Gary’s Bar, to Jonjo Jury at the George &amp; Dragon, to Secret Sundaze parties, and so on. If you are a 40-plus reformed clubber with a working knowledge of the area, prepare to feel sentimental on reading that list, and then to feel very, very old. The Light Bar, a three-storey former power station built in the late 1800s, has always been a striking building; I’ll stop short of saying it’s beautiful, though, because it was never that. It’s a small miracle that the bulldozers didn’t flatten it in the noughties, when a 2008 campaign fronted by the likes of Tracey Emin and Suggs kept it intact, though it took a certain leap of faith to believe that this cavernous, draughty, falling-down relic midway between Liverpool Street and The Tea Building was in any way important. Years later, and after many millions spent on titivation, I’m so glad someone did, because now in modern Shoreditch, among the glass-fronted skyscrapers and Boxpark, there’s still a chunk of the Great Eastern Electric Light Generating Station left, with its glorious red bricks and arched windows. Inside, in a ground-floor space called The Engine Room, it is flatteringly lit and elegant, with open brickwork, navy leather and bronze features. While the downstairs focuses on dining and the brainwaves of chef Johnnie Collins, the upstairs Copper Bar is a cocktail destination, while the soon-to-open rooftop Timber Bar will be for private dining. The menu is eclectic, surprising and at times peculiar. Giant pale radishes come with their leafy tops and a puddle of wild garlic mayo. A wobblingly fresh burrata is doused in pink pickled rhubarb and broad bean tops from Stepney City Farm. Husky-brown, deep-fried artichokes arrive with a cashew and green chilli sauce, and though I’m unsure if either of those things was delicious, they were certainly beautiful, and as Keats once said, “A thing of beauty is a joy for ever.” Much more definitely wonderful was the Spence Bakery focaccia, griddled until almost fire-damaged and served with heavily salted butter. I try not to fill up on bread, but this was too good to be taken back to the kitchen. The Light Bar’s menu is part Mad Hatter’s Tea Party, part Japanese yōshoku spot. Fried braised beef comes in a bun and smothered in a chocolate-laced barbecue sauce – not too chocolatey, but certainly there. And if that sounds a bit too Letitia Cropley on The Vicar of Dibley, then perhaps The Light Bar isn’t for you. Chunky robata monkfish skewers are marinaded in black sesame, while a Swaledale chicken skewer is paired with preserved Tropea onion. Here is a chef who refuses to be bland, and who bombards his diners with flavour; sometimes delicious, sometimes offputting, but never forgettable. They’re not here to serve cosy burgers, eggs on muffins and bottomless prosecco brunches. In fact, this is exactly the Shoreditch edge that winds up the rest of the country. Still alive, still kicking, and now served with chocolate barbecue sauce. The highlight of lunch turned out to be a fat, sugary, fresh doughnut: a plump, sugared one filled with rhubarb and miso ice-cream, then made pretty with sesame-flavoured dust; it was like a walk along Blackpool front in the 1980s, but with bells on. We also had the “Simon Hopkinson dark chocolate tart”, which was fiercely fennelly and demolished without any quibbles. We came for an hour, and ended up staying for five, because it was raining and the cocktail list and the wonderful staff made leaving increasingly difficult. The “Family” cocktail is a chic, neat margarita made with tequila, peach, lime, chilli and ginger ale. I raised one, or more like three, to a new era of post-pandemic Shoreditch. Still alive, still keeping it foolish. • The Light Bar 233 Shoreditch High Street, London E1, 020-8194 1685. Open Mon 4pm-midnight, Tues-Sat noon-midnight, Sun noon-6pm.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(180,'2020-12-18T10:00:06Z','My weird year of eating out, and in | Grace Dent on restaurants','I vividly remember the conversation as we were walking through Covent Garden back in early February, on the way home from dinner at the Korean restaurant Yori. Or at least my idiotic part in it. “It sounds like flu,” I said, tipsy on a surfeit of peach soju. “I’ve had bad flu before and, well, it didn’t kill me. How bad can this Covid thing be?” Reports of this lurgy weren’t the type of problem I had time for. Not when there were proper things to worry about, such as how the British restaurant scene in early 2020 was so jubilant, and there was so much going on, that paying it tribute was quite difficult to plot. Poor me, I know. I needed to make the time to go to Abergavenny to revisit The Walnut Tree, perhaps in the spring, then hopefully another dinner at Gareth Ward’s very brilliant Ynyshir; there were openings to review in Edinburgh, and I’d possibly already spent too much time in the food quarter of Ancoats, which some Mancunians were calling Scrancoats. I’d spent early 2020 railing against the things I saw as real issues in hospitality: the seemingly unstoppable food-hall scene that stole 50 quid out of your purse for a bespoke burger and the privilege of ferrying your own drinks from the bar; I was similarly irked by the steep rise of low-intervention wine flights, servers spending aeons lecturing me on food waste, and was wary about an upcoming visit to Tom Aikens’ new conceptual dining space, Muse, where the menu wasn’t a list of dishes but a list of feelings (one dish was called “Conquering the Beech Tree. My first memory as a child was a sense of fearlessness; I was always taking risks and looking for challenges. We had a very tall and beautiful copper beech tree in our garden that I would climb again and again. As chefs, we must always challenge ourselves.”) What a list of ridiculous non-problems this seems now, because that Covid thing turned out to be very nasty indeed. It transpires that, even when well-oiled on Korean liqueur, I am no epidemiologist. In March, when almost everything stopped – stoves off, chairs up, staff furloughed or let go – a reality set in that restaurants may never be quite the same again. Like many of us, I self-soothed for a bit with home cooking, planning and list-making, with lentil-soaking and seed-sowing, and with setting the alarm for 4am to secure a supermarket delivery slot. I used up browning bananas in cakes, joined an underground network of people who knew where Be-Ro flours were stocked, and stopped just short of naming a sourdough starter. I began in great feisty spirit, but by June had fallen into a pattern of dull pasta dinners and possibly too many glasses of nullifying rosé. Super Saturday in July saw some restrictions lift and some restaurants reopen, although, in some ways, this (temporary) freedom merely gave me a chance to take stock of what we’d lost, potentially for ever. Finding an open Pret a Manger was suddenly a struggle. Breakfast buffets were unhygienic. Bars in hotels were closed until further notice. Organising an impromptu meal with friends was now a delicate ballet, peopled with those who could and would come out and those who wouldn’t dare leave the house. “What do the rules say we can do?” was a question my friends and I debated constantly. There were moments of joy at The Clarence Tavern in Stoke Newington, Chuku’s in Tottenham and The Curlew in Bodiam, East Sussex, but then the R rate rose again and the shutters came down again. Early autumn was the season of the fancy DIY restaurant food kit, which I don’t really believe any restaurant is making any profit from. These kits feel more like a flag in the sand that indicates: “Somewhere here lies an almost-alive restaurant.” And although I’m happy to try cooking at home, I could do without all the leftover plastic. Each delivery flooded my house with tiny pots, silver foil, plastic bags and insulating foam, and then, after the cooking, there was all the washing-up and removing badly piped ganache from the ceiling. All the second lockdown did was reinforce my love of being cooked for. In fact, a plate of food made by a chef and placed in front of me with a smile is certainly one of the great joys of being human. As 2021 draws near, I realise the thing I’ll miss most about the future is the thrill of a full-to-the-brim Friday night restaurant. I mourn the days of bustling, chaotic service, noisy dining rooms and leaning in so close to a friend that you can feel their spittle in your ear as they vent. Those days are gone, I think. I’ll miss sticky, laminated menus covered in fingerprints, and seeing the faces of the people serving me. I’ll miss each restaurant that isn’t coming back. I’ll miss my naivety that night in Covent Garden, full of Korean liqueur and kimchi and pajeon, that a little virus could change anything. The future of eating out is mysterious and ever-changing. I promise to carry on going out there, and dutifully reporting back.','https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/dec/18/my-weird-year-of-eating-out-and-in-grace-dent-restaurants','Grace Dent','My weird year of eating out, and in | Grace Dent on restaurants',-2.45438910000000021,54.2776946999999907,0.273199999999999998);

We were ever so grateful when outdoor dining restored a semblance of semi-normality, but let’s be very honest, not one sane soul will pine for this season of swamped booking systems and damp bum cheeks. I’ve accepted 3.45pm dinner bookings to eat under dripping tarpaulin, I’ve wangled my way into limited-menu brunches in repurposed loading bays and I’ve eaten pommes boulangère while dressed like Hagrid, with harsh, unforgiving daylight exposing the map of fine lines on my forehead, which I’d much prefer to hide in a flatteringly lit banquette. All this has only given me fresh empathy and gratitude for the proto-human species 1.9m years ago in Tanzania’s Olduvai gorge, who, some argue, built the first houses. Walls and ceilings, it turns out, are really, really bloody brilliant. I have missed the notion of putting a coat in the cloakroom, settling in, getting cosy and lingering a little too long. As for spontaneity, I wonder sometimes if we’ll ever “pop out for a drink” or “pop out for a bite to eat” ever again. Gosh, I miss “popping”. No planning or booking a table for two weeks on Wednesday; just impromptu popping. What heaven that was. An American friend once told me that popping was a uniquely British thing, similar in its adorable quaintness to “grabbing a cheeky Nandos”. The British, perhaps more than any other culture, adore the notion that they’ve sneaked a totally unscheduled hour of boozing or eating into an otherwise banal day. This is why cafes in garden centres are so insanely popular, and why the best part of Ikea is popping to the restaurant for meatballs and Daim bar cake. Still, I’m glad I persevered with fighting for a booking for Fenn, which I made three weeks beforehand, because as far as “eating out” went, it turned out to be one of the classiest examples. Fenn is a modern European, date night kind of restaurant with an elegant, enclosed terrace. It is from the team behind Nest in Hackney, and its head chef, Joe Laker, was previously at Anglo in Farringdon, a place I often recommend to London visitors for its imaginative menu, which treads exactly the right line for diners who want to experiment with fine, artsy dining, but also, importantly, want dinner. Fenn has flourishes that call back to both those venues, serving lovingly imagined, thoughtfully sourced, but not overly earnest plates made from scratch and offered as a set menu for £45 per head, or à la carte. FFC (Fenn fried chicken) is a feisty, peppery, high-end spin on KFC-style popcorn chicken nuggets, while the beef tartare is a generous, almost crimson portion dusted in fermented chilli powder and with a rich, smoky oil. Even the freshly baked, pillowy potato sourdough, which comes in slices that are thick enough to rest your head on, is a labour of love. A pyramid of chewy dumplings, more like dough balls, sits prettily on a plate of Lincolnshire poacher cheese; this is the dish you’re most likely to want to take a photo of, if aesthetics are your thing. You can add grated truffle for an extra £6 if you’re feeling like Kim Kardashian. Whopping hand-dived scallops bathe in roasted chicken butter. They make their own Tabasco-style sauce to serve with Cornish rock oysters, at £3 each; it is sunrise in a saucer, with just the right amount of salt and fire. I’ve been wary of anyone trying to recreate well-loved, mass-produced tastes ever since my grandmother swore she could make Heinz salad cream with white spirit vinegar and egg yolk. (Spoiler: she could not.) Among the larger plates at £20-30, which could be classed as main courses (or split), the Yorkshire beef – rump and cheek with potato cake – is very good, particularly its vivid emerald puddle of pureed sprouting broccoli with such depth of exuberant flavour that Charles and I kept going back to it, extolling its wonder like Lord Percy in Blackadder discovering “green”. “How does he make broccoli taste so much of broccoli?’ I asked the staff in the manner of a woman who had ordered a tequila-based cocktail called The Protagonist as an aperitif, before moving on to a large glass of Cantina Orsogna Primitivo and who was therefore possibly not wholly eloquent. They were more than lovely about my questions. Fenn offers the kind of casual yet caring service that verges on Michelin standard, but could equally be the cafe on the corner. Fenn was good when it was only half working, so by the time you get there, the place will be flying. The nutmeg-laden custard tart is stupendous. I’ll be popping back, whenever popping makes its big resurgence. • Fenn 194 Wandsworth Bridge Road, London SW6, 020-7371 9888. Open lunch Thurs-Sun, noon-2pm (3pm Sun); dinner Tues-Sat, 5-9.30pm.

Burnham Rd, PE31 8QD; 01485 518330 The Ingham Swan, Ingham, Norwich It’s three courses for £30 at this pretty pub; we’d be considering pork with burnt apple, followed by shiitake and saffron risotto, then orange sponge with burnt white chocolate. Sea Palling Rd, NR12 9AB; 01692 581099 The Wildebeest, Stoke Holy Cross, Norwich As popular on Sundays as its sister restaurant the Ingham Swan, the Wildebeest puts local produce at the centre of traditional roasts, while creative flourishes are applied to starters and puddings. 82-86 Norwich Rd, NR14 8QJ; 01508 492497 LONDON Le Petit Beefbar, Chelsea The clue is in the name of this international chain where beef reigns supreme. At brunch there’s ribeye ham in the croissant, or pulled beef in the truffled eggs benedict. There’s one roast: Hereford rump, with beef fat potatoes – perhaps chased down with a bullshot cocktail (vodka, consommé and spices). 27 Cale St, SW3 3QP; 020 4580 1219 The Coach Makers Arms, Marylebone The hearty roasts at this Victorian pub come with all the sides, but you may find yourself distracted by snacks such as devilled eggs with Exmoor caviar, fried courgette flower, or a blue-cheese soufflé with crab sauce. If you can’t find room for pudding, at least consider a passionfruit jelly petit four. 88 Marylebone Ln, W1U 2PZ; 020 7224 4022 The Jolly Gardeners, Putney Will you have a full roast with pigs in blankets and cauliflower cheese, or slow-cooked beef and ale pie with clotted cream mash, pangrattato and bordelaise sauce?

If roasties aren’t enough potato for you, quadruple-down with sides of pecorino fries, beef-fat chips, and nduja mash. 14 Hotel St, LE1 5AW; 0116 303 3310 The Nelson, Burton-Joyce You can have your traditional roast by the fire, but if you want something lighter, the Nelson offers tabbouleh with your chicken, or roast beef in a salad with blue cheese. Which means you’ll have room for sticky toffee pudding and cheese. Chestnut Grove, NG14 5DN; 0115 931 1800 NORTH The Feathers Inn, Stocksfield The cosy factor is high at this country pub: rooms have wood-burners, fire-pit roasts come with six or seven veg sides, and there are comforting sweets to finish, perhaps marmalade pudding with custard. Hedley on the Hill, NE43 7SW; 01661 843607 The Grey Horse, Glazebury This community pub’s roast is a steal (three courses for £20, featuring the not-seen-often-enough option of glazed ham), but when locals want something lighter they go for the Yorkshire-pudding roast wrap. Warrington Rd, Leigh End, WA3 5LZ; 01925 640508 The Mowbray, Neepsend, Sheffield Keep an eye on the website for the “great Sheffield roast”, held intermittently at this prop-perfect events venue. Dinner is served family style, with options for vegetarians and kids. 118 Mowbray St, S3 8EN; 0114 276 7885 NORTHERN IRELAND The Grateful Bread, Belfast Sometimes Sundays are less about roast meat and more about delicious things on toast, bowls of spicy spuds and possibly the best cheese toastie in town. The American Bar, 65 Dock St, BT15 1LF Dundrum Inn, Dundrum Lucky locals can choose from lamb shank, nut roast and pork or go for Christmas vibes with turkey and ham – all come with roasties and mash, as well as the friendly welcome (extended to dogs) that keeps them coming back. 143 Main St, BT33 0LX; 028 4375 1211 Coco, Belfast There’s roast beef on offer, but the Sunday menu here mostly dances between the Med and southeast Asia – even traditionalists will waver in the face of hot and sour lobster soup, crisp lamb breast salad and cherry clafoutis. 7-11 Linenhall St, BT2 8AA; 028 9031 1150 SCOTLAND The Ox, Edinburgh As you’d expect from the name, the Sunday lunch at this friendly pub is roast beef and they do it well – though vegetarians won’t get second best, with their own roast and tomato gravy. 49-51 London St, EH3 6LX; 0131 556 9808 Kyloe, Edinburgh It usually serves up a steakhouse experience, but on Sundays the staff at Kyloe carve the Aberdeen Angus tableside, for an upmarket roast.

The Rutland Hotel, 1-3 Rutland St, EH1 2AE; 031 229 3402 The Scran &amp; Scallie, Edinburgh Sundays are always a bit special at this friendly neighbourhood gastropub, with an eye to celebrating Scottish ingredients and keeping kids happy too. 1 Comely Bank Rd, EH4 1DT; 0131 332 6281 SOUTH Cyan, Brighton Get a group of friends, crack open the cocktail menu and Sunday in style in this beautiful blue room.

The Grand Brighton, 97-99 Kings Rd, BN1 2FW; 01273 224300 The White Oak, Cookham At this much-awarded, smart village pub, you can feel confident to skip the R-word – they’re present and correct, but it’s nice to have options, especially seafood and vegetarian ones. Consider marinated beetroot or torched mackerel with seaweed mayo and mirin gel, then perhaps crispy polenta, either with fresh veg or grilled bream. The Pound, SL6 9QE; 01628 523043 The Double Red Duke, Bampton Jay Rayner called this beautiful stone pub “a class act” and clearly regulars think this goes double on a Sunday.

Small plates £5.50-£8, large plates £9-£15, desserts £5-£6, wine from £26 a bottle With some restaurants, it’s all about the story. Imad’s Syrian Kitchen is one of them. Imad Alarnab, a round-shouldered man with the sort of soft smile that tells you everything is going to be OK, was a successful chef and restaurateur in Damascus. He ran three restaurants in the city alongside cafés and juice bars. It took just six days at the height of the Syrian war for them all to be destroyed. In 2015, he left to find a better life for his family. He would send for them later. He made his way to Calais where, for 64 days, he slept on the steps of a church. During the day he cooked for fellow refugees, up to 400 of them at a time. Eventually, he made it to London, where he was given asylum and was able to make good on his promise to his family, who joined him. At first, he worked as a car salesman. But he wasn’t a car salesman, he was a chef. So he started doing that instead. He ran supper clubs and pop-up restaurants and falafel bars, raising thousands of pounds for the charity Choose Love, which works with refugees just like Alarnab. Later, he raised a further £50,000 through a crowdfunder for his own permanent restaurant. It was due to open last December. Now, finally, here it is in the space off London’s Carnaby Street previously occupied by Asma Khan’s Darjeeling Express; a white-walled, floorboarded room suffused with light beneath a beamed ceiling. It gives the sense of being tucked into the eaves of a house, away from the chaos of the world. Fair enough. Alarnab knows more than enough about the chaos of the world. My job is to tell you whether a restaurant is any good. Surely that job has been done. Imad’s Syrian Kitchen represents all the good things. It’s a hell of a story. Once upon a time I would have felt like a mere observer, but as the dismal anti-immigration rhetoric has intensified, as the little Englanders have frothed at the mouth about those who have the audacity to flee war and desolation, as if the search for better was a personal insult, I have increasingly felt myself to have skin in the game. I am the great-grandchild of earlier refugees who came looking for better and gave more than they took. Or to put it in terms relevant to a restaurant column, we do not have a more diverse restaurant sector than any other country in Europe by accident. It’s the product of waves of immigration. And yes, of course, some of that is also the product of rampant imperialism; the two things are often fellow travellers. Still, the fact is that if you enjoy eating the food of the Indian subcontinent, or of China and the Middle East, or of West and East Africa, of Thailand and Japan and Poland and all other points of the compass, cooked by people schooled from birth in its intricacies, you should give thanks for immigration. You should give thanks to people like Imad Alarnab, some of whom have risked their lives to be here. I know this is all bloody obvious, but sometimes the obvious needs to be said. The menu he has brought with him is short and to the point. On the left are eight meat-free small plates for between £5.50 and £8; on the right are five larger chicken and lamb mains for between £9 and £15. The short wine list, weirdly, is less welcoming price-wise; surely they can find a reasonable red wine to sell for less than £26 or a white for less than £31, currently the opening prices. I hope so. Then again £1 from every bill will be donated to Choose Love. Few dish descriptions will startle anybody reasonably versed in the Middle Eastern repertoire, though they have their own idiosyncrasies. The hummus here is a cheerily rugged and punchy affair, topped with whole chickpeas, micro greens, dribbles of olive oil and the purple promise of sumac. There are warm, pillow-soft rounds of flatbread puffing hot air at you as you tear into them. His sesame seed-studded falafel, which brought him so much love shortly after he arrived in London, are shaped not as familiar balls, but as thick discs with a hole in the middle. An online search suggests this is specifically Syrian, but please do educate me. The result, of course, is more surface area crunch to spiced interior. More crunch is always a good thing, as are the ribbons of pickled onions with which they are topped and the puddle of tahini beneath. The star dish is the baba ghanoj, the smoky aubergine purée presented in the crisped skin and topped with pomegranate seeds and dribbles of more tahini. The only duff note is a rocket salad with “noodles” of squeaky halloumi. Turning halloumi into noodles does not stop it being the underachiever of the cheese world. There are cubes of watermelon and a dusting of za’atar, too, but it needs more of a dressing to get it moving. From the other side of the menu we have chargrilled and crisp-skinned chicken thighs, on a tomatoey mess of bulgur wheat alongside a chilli sauce that creeps in quietly then slaps you cheerily round the face. Because this kitchen roasts aubergine so well we have more of them filled with spiced minced lamb, on a bed of torn, crisped flatbread designed to soak up the juices. At the end there are squares of their own dense baklava with toffeed filo pastry, plus rounds of dense pistachio ice-cream, wearing a bonnet of candy floss. Alarnab delivers this himself. He tells me it is a Damascene speciality. It is, as the best desserts are, a childish delight. While the ice-cream may be specifically located to Damascus, much of this menu’s basics really are familiar. That same story of refugees and immigration means we are rich in experience in the UK. Lucky us. But there’s something else going on here that makes it as sweet as the tangled knot of candy floss at the end. In between serving dishes and tidying away plates, Alarnab spends time with his family who, he tells me with a sweet grin, happen to be here dining in their dad’s restaurant for the first time. It’s the simplest of stories, isn’t it? A father feeding his teenage kids. But the journey that brought them to that table, in this calming, whitewashed room, high above London, is anything but. News bites The highly regarded Sheffield restaurant Jöro is launching a very boutique hotel – it will only have four bedrooms – close by the mothership.

All four bedrooms and the table will be bookable by single groups of eight. Visit jororestaurant.co.uk.

Snacks £2-£7, starters £9-£14, mains £18-£24, desserts £6, wines from £32 Just as the Inuit are reputed to have many words for snow, so the people of Sussex, both East and West, are said to have many words for mud. A lot of them have a pleasing onomatopoeic squelch. There is “gawm”, for the nastiest-smelling kind of mud and “stodge” for the thickest pudding-like type. There is “swank” for a muddy bog and “stug” for watery mud, and “gubber” for a trench of rotting matter. I like the industrious, grinding Sussex represented by this nerdy vocabulary. People who work the land need the brevity provided by such words. Even so, I don’t want to spend much time there. I am very much happier in the version of Sussex currently trading under that name from the venerable premises at 63-64 Frith Street in London. For a long time, it was the bistro where the great Bruno Loubet first paired scallops with black pudding. For a decade after that it was Arbutus, the flagship restaurant of chef Anthony Demetre, where you would always be fed very well indeed. London’s Soho has many places in which you can eat; surprisingly few of them are the sort where both you and the kitchen are invited to take your dinner seriously. Sussex stands in the noble tradition of what has gone before. It is the fourth restaurant from the Gladwin brothers, who also have The Shed in Notting Hill, Rabbit on the King’s Road and Nutbourne in Battersea. All of them big up the fact that they source a lot of their produce and some of their wines from the family farm in West Sussex. Apparently, it’s countryside cooking in the city. Inside, there is black-painted half-wood panelling and squelchy banquettes and the general mood of being in the dining room of a Farrow &amp; Balled pub somewhere just outside Pulborough, where the air smells lightly of cow parsley and dung. It’s a conceit, of course. All city restaurants get the food they serve from outside the city, unless they’re bagging tubercular squirrels on the quiet in Soho Square or foraging down Park Lane’s fox-piss-stained central reservation. Which they aren’t. But it’s a conceit into which I am very happy to buy. For reasons of pandemic travel advice and my own settling mobility, leaving the capital has proved tricky. Here might be a way to do it. Kind of. There are clear outbreaks of Vaughan Williams Englishness; of food, from a kitchen led by Oliver Gladwin, best eaten to strains of The Lark Ascending. But there is also cosmopolitan inquisitiveness. From the snacks menu come spring onions tempura, the fat alliums presented in a lacy batter and served with a lime-spritzed yoghurt dipping sauce. Sussex chorizo turns up as rich, crunchy-shelled croquettes. And then there are Marmite eclairs: choux pastry buns filled with a truffled mushroom duxelles given a salty push courtesy of the yeast extract. It’s an eye-widener. Just one of those does the job. Or perhaps none, if Marmite isn’t your thing. It’s the starters which give a real sense of where we’re going here, which is out into the meadow. There are brilliant orange ribbons of cured trout, with proper bite and flavour, alongside diced pickled cucumber, cultured cream and dill. And then the star of the show: spears of asparagus of the deepest green, with dollops of a sprightly, frothy hollandaise made by someone who has whipped up a lot of it, and understands the mechanics of the emulsion. Many plates of these go out, a robust testament to the enduring appeal of simple things. Mains are robust and sturdy in a very good way. The specials include a hefty beef Wellington for two. There’s a thick fillet of cod with paunchy mussels in the shell, new potatoes and a ripe oyster velouté. A disc of confited, then crisped lamb shoulder with deep-fried sweetbreads comes with one of those richly reduced meaty sauces that leaves you smacking your lips. It also come with “seed clusters”. Ah yes, the seeds. They are what I’d call a recurring motif, if that didn’t make it sound more agreeable than it is. Somewhere in that kitchen there is a huge box of mixed seeds and they are damn well going to use them, a blunt signifier of countryside. The asparagus are scattered with them. The side of hispi cabbage is littered with them, like the wind just blew them off a field. For an older clientele given to cavities, it’s not always welcome. You try getting a dental appointment right now. Enough with the seeds already. All of the great dishes upon which they appear would still be great without them. The opening price for wines is £32 a bottle which, worryingly, is starting to look like the norm in the capital right now. It is entirely possible to find reasonable wines that, even when marked up by a multiple of three, puts them in the mid to low 20s. They do, however, get credit for a lengthy list by the glass. We have a bottle of the Nutbourne chardonnay from the family vineyard and it is a crisp, bright chablis-like joy. Service is slick, cheery, informative, in a minor public school way, and knows when it’s not needed. There’s an awful lot to like about Sussex. I want to be able to carry that love through to dessert, but I can’t. I was hoping for a classic Sussex pond pudding, though I can see that on a warm summer’s night, a sweet suet crust filled with a whole lemon, sugar and butter with its own gravitational pull might not sell. A squidgy chocolate and hazelnut torte with crème fraîche is fine. Honeycomb with mascarpone sounds like a great idea but isn’t. There are three huge boulders of honeycomb, like the monoliths the apes throw sticks at in Kubrick’s 2001. They are stuck to the plate by small splodges of mascarpone. At this volume, the honeycomb is a fizzing bomb of bicarb. The only other choice is a strawberry mess. Dessert feels like an afterthought. On a central serving station, I spot a selection of English cheeses; hard, craggy, buttercup-yellow cheddars and pale soft cheeses trying to make a run for it. I rarely order cheese in restaurants.

After all, it can be a cracking way to get seeds out of your teeth. News bites Game chef Max Gott, previously of Bistro 46 in Newcastle, has now moved on to the Ox in Middleton, Northumberland. As part of the food offering, he’s staging ‘Wild and Dine’ events in the grounds of the pub, promising to celebrate the ‘bounty of the season with a feast cooked over fire’. The next one takes place on 10 July and tickets cost £65. Visit wildanddine.wordpress.com. One of the big names of Italian food in America is opening in London next month. Nancy Silverton’s Pizzeria Mozza will be located on the ground floor of the Treehouse Hotel on Langham Place. California-born Silverton trained at the Cordon Bleu Culinary School in Marylebone in the 70s, before returning to the States where she became Wolfgang Puck’s pastry chef at Spago. She later opened a series of highly successful businesses. Alongside the pizzas, will be a list of antipasti including salt cod fritti, celeriac remoulade and courgette flowers with ricotta.

According to Indeed Flex, an online marketplace for flexible workers, pubs and restaurants are having to increase pay for temporary staff to fill gaps, by as much as 14% compared to May 2019. The rises are not evenly spread. While in London it’s just under 4%, Yorkshire, Greater Manchester and Cheshire are seeing those double-digit increases. • This article was amended on 29 June 2021 to correct the name of Pizzeria Mozza which we had misrendered as “Pizza Mozza”.

A sleeker, brighter, better, post-pandemic me is coming out of lockdown. Yes, “data not dates”, our prime minister did warn us, but regardless, the date I’m focusing on is 12 April, the earliest outdoor dining can begin again – and the data I see whenever I step near the scales can be extrapolated thus: “Reduce refined carbohydrate now. No more comté and Heinz sandwich spread toasties with a Frazzle garnish in bed. The new world is beginning.” This will, I fear, feature the need to wear button-up pants and to have fewer boobs on my back than on my front. If the sharp increase in forlorn, beginner-level joggers and power-walkers down at my local park is any indication, I’m not alone in this panic. One of my closest friends, also in his 40s, embarked on a strict Atkins plan as soon as the road map dates were unveiled. Or, more accurately, as soon as he realised that even his smart, lace-up shoes no longer fitted. “How … how have I gained weight on my toes?!” Some of us are intensely relaxed about the extra Covid kilos; indeed, they’ve embraced their jiggle, wobble and wattle with aplomb. By God, I wish I were one of them. Body positivity, I have argued before in this newspaper, is almost always a Generation Z and millennial notion. Then there are people such as myself, Generation X, who find photos of 55-year-old Liz Hurley in a size-6 bikini deeply triggering. We knew the calorific value of a Ryvita and a tablespoon of cottage cheese by the age of 12, and have a slightly-too-snug formal outfit hanging eternally on our bedroom door with a deadline to drop five kilos via restriction and star jumps. For us, although the pandemic has been cruel and frightening in a thousand different ways, one tiny, shining light of joy is how it has permitted us time off from trying to be better. In January, joy was scant, but hurling huge handfuls of dried penne into a pan as if carb-loading for the Marathon des Sables felt a bit like happiness. Who among us hasn’t eaten Gü chocolate and salted caramel spread straight out of the jar and mistaken it for love? And now the day of reckoning is on the horizon, for folk such as myself and my friend, who is currently able to wear only carpet slippers. We may have spent the past 12 months swapping WhatsApp messages on finish-at-home dauphinoise potato kits and the morality of drinking iced vermouth for breakfast, but now, after blaming the government, the weather and our hormones for our weight gain, we have moved on to that stage we all go through two weeks into a health kick: discussing how brilliant clean, restricted eating can actually be. A large, filling, protein-rich omelette is just as lovely, we agreed, without yummy, thickly buttered bloomer toast. And although a warm, fresh croissant filled with sweet, squidgy almond paste and gently festooned in icing sugar is the perfect mid-morning pick-me-up, it was only making us sluggish. We don’t want that because, in the new world, we must be at the top of our game. Too much time has been lost: new world inhabitants must be bright, alert and ready for anything. This is why intermittent fasting and conquering blood sugar spikes is so important. And did I mention smaller knickers? At the end of last week, carb-starved, dizzy and finding changing the duvet cover an ongoing war of attrition, it struck me that, as the world begins to open, I have been building myself a new prison. The mere challenge of emerging from lockdown like a beautiful butterfly, rather than a clomping Very Hungry Caterpillar, is only one of the many transformations and challenges I’ve set for myself. New me, I vowed, would not only carry on walking or running at least five miles daily, she would stay abundantly, vigilantly hydrated and spend early mornings manifesting growth and whispering personal affirmations. (The millions of users on the new-ish social media platform Clubhouse are obsessed with this.) New world me will pre-plan all her time off for the coming year with rewarding staycations and catch-up dinners with friends on great tables in the loveliest restaurants. New world me will drink vodka shots on the Trans-Siberian railway, play topless ping-pong in Antigua and squeeze every inch out of life, because, after all, life is for living. The new world sounds exhausting. I miss nights in with pasta already.','https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/mar/19/who-hasnt-eaten-chocolate-spread-straight-out-of-the-jar-and-mistaken-it-for-love','Grace Dent','Who hasn’t eaten chocolate spread straight out of the jar, and mistaken it for love? | Grace Dent',-2.45438910000000021,54.2776946999999907,0.750600000000000044);

Perhaps, like me, you carry from childhood an inner voice that says pleasant weather must not be wasted. As kids, on sunny March mornings, my brothers and I lived in semi-terror of our mother rumbling up the stairs into our rooms with seize-the-day vigour. This rarely involved a motion to lounge about eating Sherbet Dip Dabs and watching Tiswas. No, but it could involve being stuffed into an Austin Maxi and whisked to the Solway Coast to paddle in rock pools close to the Sellafield nuclear reactor, before sharing a pork pie brought from home and featuring a terrifying, greying boiled egg suspended in jelly. Or “potted meat” spread into sliced baps, though from which specific animal this peppery mush came remained a mystery. Importantly, it was drummed into us from the outset that a warm, bright day should be used, even if that involved a four-hour round trip to a discount furniture warehouse with a kids’ zip-slide in the forecourt. At least there was the chance of a Slush Puppie. This year, however, wasting the start of spring and squandering the sunshine is very much a legal requirement. And it will remain so for all of March, which is making me feel quite peculiar. Semi-furious and then sometimes just sad. As the temperature rose to a heady 13C in London last week and dusk stretched to almost 6pm, wasting any more time has begun to feel immoral. We have all wasted so much time in the past year. As I stare at my empty calendar, full of restaurants that might open in June, but might not, that faux-happy song Enjoy Yourself (It’s Later Than You Think), covered by Prince Buster and The Specials, often circulates in my brain. This is not merely a song about going to more parties, which was my reading of it when I was a teenager; it’s a song about mortality. And how you get only so many chances to eat cream cakes, drink cider and pour yourself into a late-night taxi while you’re still in the pink, as opposed to being, well, in the grey and carried off by a team of pallbearers. “The whole of March indoors is undoable,” I have roared more than once this week, somewhat childishly, as if there isn’t a pandemic going on and as if people haven’t lost a whole lot more than dinners. But it is warm outdoors and there is daylight and the penny has finally dropped – for me, at least – that lockdown whisked away an entire year of my lifetime when I still had semi-reliable knees. There is a strong case, I believe, that 2020 should not count on the Gregorian calendar and we should therefore have it knocked off our ages. At the bakery on the high street, I have taken to queuing for fresh bread at peak time just to see faces, hear actual human chatter and smell new things. It is one in, one out, just like an exclusive nightclub. The queue moves arduously slowly, because, once inside, every customer takes their good, long, sweet time to loiter over some actual pleasure. I don’t blame them, either; we are all in our own ways under-stimulated. I watch them examine the shelves of artisan jams, daintily iced cookies and bespoke truffles. They languish inside the baker’s for all of their five allotted minutes, because seeing new things in real life, rather than while internet shopping, is so rare these days. Outside, I stand with the sun on my face, thinking how the pavement smells different in springtime. And how this beautiful daylight lends itself to cold, gossipy glasses of wine with friends on a pub patio, and to messy, cheap and cheerful pizza lunches, from which you tumble out into the daylight at 4pm, feeling tipsy and hopeful and, most of all, replete with in-jokes and shared piss-taking, which is the cornerstone of British friendship. And how, I now have to admit, I miss paddling in radioactive algae on the Solway Coast, before the unveiling of the bottle of dandelion and burdock and the wonkily iced homemade fairy cakes each decorated with a solitary Midget Gem. Up until now, I took everything for granted. I won’t get fooled again.','https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/mar/05/i-go-to-the-bakers-at-peak-time-just-to-see-faces-and-hear-chatter-grace-dent','Grace Dent','I go to the baker''s at peak time just to see faces and hear chatter | Grace Dent',-2.45438910000000021,54.2776946999999907,0.421499999999999985);

Sea Palling Rd, NR12 9AB; 01692 581099 The Wildebeest, Stoke Holy Cross Just outside Norwich, Daniel Smith’s dining room is relaxed and pared back, all the better to appreciate the detail in dishes such as seared scallops with pork belly, boudin noir, pickled cauliflower, granny smith, burnt apple purée and pork puff. 82-86 Norwich Rd, NR14 8QJ; 01508 492497 The Unruly Pig, Woodbridge The totem animal may be unruly but chefs Dave Wall and Karl Green have things under control in the kitchen, turning British produce into Italian-inspired dishes (veal sweetbread “osso buco” with veal shin ravioli, bone marrow, gremolata), and taking the top spot in this year’s Top 50 Gastropubs list. Orford Rd, Bromeswell, IP12 2PU; 01394 460310 LONDON Home SW15, Putney The team here like to call it a “home from home”, where you can stop in for a morning coffee, post-work cocktail and dinner that is a cut above home cooking – unless your midweek dinner is salt and pepper squid with crisp curry leaves and saffron aioli, followed by iberico pork and urfa chilli butter, and strawberry shortcake. 146 Upper Richmond Rd, SW15 2SW; 020 8780 0592 The Princess Royal, Notting Hill From the bar to the beautiful gardens, this is one of west London’s prettiest, most well put together pubs. It’s open for breakfast, lunch and dinner every day, with crowd-pleasing menus, and frequently holds special dinners with guest chefs. 47 Hereford Rd, W2 5AH; 020 3096 6996 Hot Stone, Angel This is one of the only places in the UK to get a taste of kobe beef, here seared at 400C on hot stones in the Japanese ishiyaki tradition. Before things heat up, there’s sashimi and maki rolls. 9 Chapel Market, N1 9EZ; 020 3302 8226 MIDLANDS Arthur’s, Belper If you want to try the creative 10-course tasting menu (£65) at this small, casual restaurant you’ll need to make a booking. Perhaps you’ll start with their take on a fish finger butty, move to seafood chorizo sausage with mojo rojo, and finish with smoked fudge. Best of all, it’s BYOB with no corkage. 1 Campbell St, DE56 1AP; 07709 209260 The Greenman, Ashbourne Depending on the day of the week, this pub kitchen sends out smart takes on pub classics and lighter snacks – try the terrine and fermented gooseberries – but on special occasions, it brushes off its favourite cookbooks to run dinners inspired by favourite chefs, including Rick Stein and Yotam Ottolenghi. 10 St John St, DE6 1GH; 01335 346040 The Cod’s Scallops, various Fish and chips are for any night of the week at this quality mini-chain, where seafood comes in daily, then is fried, baked or grilled to order. There’s monkfish curry for something different, perhaps some cockles for while you wait, and pies for anyone who doesn’t fancy fish. NORTH Tonco, Sharrow, Sheffield Every neighbourhood should have a Tonco. Locals order a couple of small plates to snack on with a glass of low-intervention wine (they know not to miss the bread), and a couple more if they want to turn a snack into dinner. That way they don’t have to choose between squid, kohlrabi and preserved lemon, or grilled beans with crisp lamb breast, plus rhubarb and fennel bombe. Have it all. 2 Dyson Pl, S11 8XX; 0114 349 3996 The Orange Bird, Hillsborough, Sheffield This local joint brings the heat – the South African-inspired menu is cooked on a braai, and the all-SA wine list goes brilliantly with caramelised aubergine and seaweed sambal, Durban curry and peri-peri chicken. To finish, don’t miss a national classic probably not found anywhere else in the UK: peppermint crisp tart. 78 Middlewood Rd, S6 4HA; 0114 234 9330 Bench, Sheffield Friendly staff, a “daily bottle”, small mark-ups on natural wine, and a clever small-plates menu with an eye for what is in season make this a near-perfect neighbourhood joint. 7b Nether Edge Rd, S7 1RU NORTHERN IRELAND The Muddlers Club, Belfast A moody bistro in the modern style (exposed brickwork and pipes, street art) with an open kitchen, where Gareth McCaughey cooks a tasting menu that is stripped bare on the page (three ingredients) but full of skill on the plate – and there’s a vegetarian option. 1 Warehouse Ln, BT1 2DX; 028 9031 3199 Ox, Belfast By the banks of the river, it’s hard to think of a prettier Belfast restaurant to have lunch in, the accomplished kitchen sending out the best of the seasons as they change; in the evening, things get a little more formal with a longer tasting menu. 1 Oxford St, BT1 3LA; 028 9031 4121 Artis, Derry The more formal sister to next door’s Soda &amp; Starch serves upmarket modern Irish cooking from Great British Menu finalist Phelim O’Hagan, featuring the best from the local land and sea. 28 Craft Village, BT48 6AR; 028 7137 1635 SCOTLAND Haar, St Andrews Masterchef The Professionals finalist Dean Banks puts his seafood passion and expertise to the fore, although whether you order from the tasting, pescatarian or vegetarian menu, whatever is fresh and good gets star treatment in this handsome restaurant with rooms. 1 Golf Pl, KY16 9JA; 01334 479281 Dean Banks at the Pompadour, Edinburgh He’s a Scottish chef who can’t sit still – Banks’s second restaurant adds a fine-dining experience to his already fine cooking. The drinks menu features only Scottish spirits, there are vegan and fish tasting menus, and options to upgrade the classic menu with ingredients including wagyu beef, truffle and caviar. Waldorf Astoria, The Caledonian Hotel, Princes St, EH1 2AB; 07770 451668 Parlour, Dundee Staff at this beloved cafe greet guests with enthusiasm, cook breakfast and lunch with a Mediterranean hue and lots of local produce, and serve it all with a smile. 58 West Port, DD1 5EP; 01382 203588 SOUTH Five Little Pigs, Wallingford Jay Rayner went and rhapsodised over the cheese toastie and venison ragu; perhaps you’ll be as enthusiastic about the pork cheeks with hedgerow vermouth, hake with fig-leaf aioli, or French-toast fingers at brunch. 26 St Mary’s St, OX10 0ET; 01491 833999 The Small Holding, Kilndown The dining room looks like a country farmhouse; apt, as this is part of a farm. The vibe may be rustic but there’s serious finesse on the food, as this is from the team behind the acclaimed Curlew – expect seven- to 10-course tasting menus. Ranters Ln, TN17 2SG; 01892 890105 The Double Red Duke, Bampton The look of this stone pub and its bright, styled interior is all Cotswolds country class, but things get wilder in the kitchen when the chefs cook over fire. Snacks, starters and mains follow the smart, modern pub handbook but are executed with finesse – and a lick of smoke. Bourton Rd, Bampton OX18 2RB; 01367 810222 WALES The Warren, Carmarthen Locals love this welcoming restaurant, which puts ethics and community first, and also manages to serve great coffee and simple hearty cooking with an equal focus on veg-based dishes. 11 Mansel St, Carmarthen SA31 1PX; 01267 236079 Purple Poppadom, Cardiff Chef Anand George takes traditional recipes from across India and gives them a contemporary twist for Wales. Expect dishes that may be less familiar – Alleppey prawn curry with raw mango, ginger and coconut sauce, perhaps – alongside his tasting menu, which could include a Syrian-Christian take on duck. 185a Cowbridge Rd East, CF11 9AJ; 029 2022 0026 The Stubborn Duckling, Aberaeron The name is cute but at dinner time cooking skills in the Duckling are serious. Perhaps you’ll start with Duck liver parfait with malt toast and crackling, then choose local lamb, green peppercorn bordelaise and truffle-cheddar mash. The only other question is, will you stop at two courses, or try the treacle tart? 25 Sgwar Alban, SA46 0AJ; 01545 571700 WEST Yak Yeti Yak, Bath Now in the basement of a Georgian townhouse, YYY has been feeding Bath with Nepalese food for 18 years. Come for classics such as momos and saffron yoghurt; stay for its own inventions inspired by Kathmandu traders, such as the ginger and chocolate ice. 12 Pierrepont St, BA1 1LA; 01225 442299 Little French, Bristol Freddy Bird is in the kitchen and his wife Nessa is on the floor, serving his classic, simple, French-inspired food – roast scallops with sauternes sauce, tomato tart with beans and olives, strawberry and rose vacherin – and wine from a list that’s pretty big for a small restaurant. 2 North View, BS6 7QB; 0117 970 6276 Le Champignon Sauvage, Cheltenham David and Helen Everitt-Matthias’s fine-dining restaurant, refined without being stuffy, has been winning acclaim since 1987 – including a Michelin star.

Yes, I’m sure Studio 54 was pleasant, and that Bianca Jagger had a terrific time on that horse in 1977, but tell me this: did she ever feel the satisfying clunk-click of leftover soup being securely locked into a neat, sterilised box? Did she ever stack freshly dishwashered plastic boxes on a shelf, each with its corresponding lid, awaiting further practical instruction? I fear not, but it is here, within these minor victories, that the purest ecstasy lies. Well, at least that’s what I am currently telling myself. During this most recent, more gruelling, seemingly endless national lockdown, I am forcing myself daily to notice each minor moment of joy; ones I took for granted in the old world. I let them linger a while in the general vicinity of my cerebral cortex, eking out the high. “Gratitude” is what folk like Oprah and Deepak Chopra call it, although folk from Leeds and farther up north would call it “knowing you’re bloody born”. I didn’t until around March 2020. That bit me on the bum. Last Monday’s happiness, for example, included unscrewing the lid of a fresh jar of instant coffee, poking a spoon through the vacuum-packed film and causing an audible pop. I loved doing this as youth, but stopped hearing the noise at all, possibly at the same time I got reliable access to dial-up internet. Tuesday was saved by the unwrapping of a new piece of Sparkenhoe red leicester and serving it with crackers from the second, fresher tier of the Christmas Jacob’s Selection and smothered in sweet, caramelised onion jam laced with the thickest black treacle. That was nearly half the week done. On Wednesday, the sun showed its face over Derwentwater at 8.21am, giving us a few more minutes’ sunlight than it did the week before. More than five, fewer than 10, but summer, I noted, is definitely coming. I mean, that’s just science. Each day will be a tiny bit lighter until, one day, on my grey winter trudge to gain supplies – I know in my heart, if I’m honest, and some days it’s harder than others – I’ll notice snowy-white spring hawthorn blossom. Or newly sprouted daffodil bulbs. All this will pass – the sadness, the bad news – but before all that, we’ll definitely put paid to winter. But I’m getting ahead of myself, because Thursday’s blessing was the small joy of perfect, fluffy steamed rice made in my fancy, modern pressure cooker. This is not at all like the pressure cooker my mother had, which was part kitchen utensil, part nuclear weapon, with its terrifying valve and high-pitched, climactic squeal that made our cats climb terrified up the wood chip, and produced corned beef hash that felt like punishment. No, I tell myself often as I stand in the kitchen, modern life can be rubbish, but it can also be remarkable. My glorious state-of-the-art pressure cooker with its preset electronic timings makes rice so light, perfect and pleasing every time without fail. It’s like waking to fresh snow each time it hisses completion. I place the leftovers in LocknLock, because in winter 2021, a bowl of fried rice, full of store-cupboard spices and a handful of freezer peas, is the next best thing to reliably replenishing serotonin. Fried rice and fantasies of the future. “There is a beer garden waiting for us,” I told my friend Courtney this week on WhatsApp. She’s been terribly poorly and needed a pep talk. “There is gin served in goldfish-bowl glasses. And bottles of rosé, ice-cold in a bucket. We will be there in August, I promise. With bags of crisps bought and splayed open on the table. And in-jokes and snoozing dogs and chats with random strangers at other tables. There will be laughing and making a racket and ‘all back to mine for a nightcap’ without guilt, tiers or repercussions.” I was telling myself as much as her. Imaginary gin and fictitious chips got me, by and large, through Friday. “We’re all getting vaccinated and it is going to be amazing,” I declared with great certainty. Then I carried on stacking my plastic storage boxes. The trick is to keep breathing. Small footsteps. Onwards. “So far, so good,” I tell myself daily.','https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/jan/22/imaginary-gin-and-fictitious-chips-got-me-through-friday-grace-dent','Grace Dent','Imaginary gin and fictitious chips got me through Friday | Grace Dent',-2.45438910000000021,54.2776946999999907,0.421499999999999985);
INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(192,'2021-03-12T10:00:07Z','Love is turning a blind eye to squashed tea bags that don’t make it to the bin | Grace Dent','As a peace-keeping mission, I spent last Sunday deep-cleaning the kitchen. Sharing a cooking space with a loved one is an unending test of patience, and we should all be more upfront about it on the first date. “Hello, I’m Grace,” I would say before even taking off my coat. “I always own at least six jars of stale mint sauce and I leave a trail of cumin seeds wherever I go. Oh, and just a heads-up, I don’t put the lids back on jars properly.” Charles, meanwhile, should have been more specific, before I fell in love with him, about his frankly unhinged belief that runny things – mayo, hot sauce, marmalade – have to be kept refrigerated. This means that every cubic inch of the fridge is stuffed with ketchups, jams and mustards, with no space for any actual food. This position is both berserk and untenable. “But jam doesn’t go off!” I say 10 times a month. “It’s a preserve!” “Well, it wouldn’t go off if you screwed the lid back on properly and stopped putting a buttery knife in it so it grows mould,” he invariably replies. His expression is weary, and of having lived through so much. Real kitchens are full of these endless, everyday ructions. In fact, ignoring how annoying we all are to share space with is the bread and butter of real love and friendship. Love is turning a blind eye to squashed tea bags that don’t quite make it to the bin and instead sit forlornly on the breadboard. Or tolerating the mystery teenage sandwich maker who leaves the bread out to go stale at 3am and the kitchen lights ablaze. Love is bin bags that aren’t secured properly, veg peelings on the floor and smiling sweetly at those among us who put empty milk cartons back in the fridge and never refill the pepper grinder. Love is tolerating that person who rarely, if ever, fills the dishwasher, yet holds strong feelings on exactly how it should be stacked. “Forks go upright in the fork drawer,” they’ll tell you, over your shoulder, while somehow missing the fact that you load the machine 14 times a week without their instruction. One of the chief reasons we adore cookery shows, I believe, is that they’re not filmed in real kitchens. Well, they are, but they’re not; it’s very clever. The lights are on, but there’s no one at home. On Saturday Kitchen and Sunday Brunch, each time the cameras turn off, a small army of food technicians rush in with sprays, mops and sponges. They ferry in trays of ingredients all neatly chopped for the chefs’ next work of art, then disappear, but not before neatening and dusting the rows of spices in the racks in the background. It is not a real kitchen in which anyone leaves a pile of used underwear in a shrine in front of the washing machine, having meant to begin a wash, only to realise the machine’s still full from two days back. When Simon Rimmer makes bechamel sauce, there’s no one standing behind him with the nozzle of the squirty cream in their gob. When the guests drink wine, the glasses are never gritty because someone forgot to add salt to the dishwasher, which leads to an argument over who last unblocked the filter. In these make-believe spaces, which we all love so much, all the spats and bad feeling are removed, and all that’s left is a place where the chef can be charismatic and play with a six-burner Bosch cooktop. I, too, am guilty of this make-believe: on a recent ITV programme, I made “homemade” fudge in my million-pound, state-of-the-art kitchen on gleaming quartz worktops and surrounded by playthings such as my avant-garde sous-vide machine, double-fronted, American-style fridge and automatic hot-water tap, all with the backdrop of a perfectly kept autumn garden. But this was not my life. It’s the life of a woman called Julie in Islington who rents out her home for £800 a day. It costs extra to pay the food stylists who measure out the sugar and the person who spends hours plastering on makeup to make me look as if I do this every day. We couldn’t film it in my actual kitchen – there’s no room due to my antique mint sauce collection – but I’ve watched a version of me on television, and that Grace’s kitchen – in fact, her entire life – is perfect. She wears a bra before noon. There’s not a cumin seed anywhere. She pours sugar on to scales, and returns the jar neatly to its shelf. “Why can’t I live with that woman?” Charles asks sadly. “She replaces lids.”','https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/mar/12/love-is-turning-a-blind-eye-to-squashed-tea-bags-that-dont-make-it-to-the-bin','Grace Dent','Love is turning a blind eye to squashed tea bags that don’t make it to the bin | Grace Dent',-2.45438910000000021,54.2776946999999907,0.648599999999999954);

Forgive me, it was delicious. So sweet and full of plump vine fruits. I ate the Mrs Botham’s landlord fruit cake steeped in Timothy Taylor pale ale, too. It’s a riff on Christmas cake, but brazenly tipsier, and apt: the Christmas season made almost no impact on me, but sweet treats are abbreviating these long, cooped-up January days. In the Lakes, the nurses who check in on my mam cannot accept fruit loaf or restorative cups of tea: their plastic head shields over face masks prevent refreshments. Not even a tempting square of Lathams’ blackcurrant flapjack with its claret-coloured jam lying slickly across the bottom of the traybake, transforming sugary oats and syrup into something fleetingly joyous. Each day, I promise myself: “Less sugar, fewer carbohydrates”, but I am yet to measure out mam’s morphine at 2am and then crave a rocket salad with an oil-free dressing. My mother, 84, and with more comebacks than Status Quo behind her, feels similarly. Occasions such as this need the big guns. Hot buttered toast laden with enough marmalade to make Paddington rethink the chest size of his duffle coat. Baked rice pudding smattered with cinnamon, and with crisp patches of caramelised skin. The sight of forced rhubarb on the shelves at Booths invites me to make a rudimentary crumble – an off-piste, recipe-free crumble made from a wonky Brownie guide memory. The results are claggy and stickily indulgent, and served with a pint of mascarpone custard that is, essentially, pourable happiness – a quick machine-gun-fire of teeth-rattling happiness, temporary, but nevertheless valid. I’m unsure what your personal pain is, but there’s a lot of it about at present. The sadness seeps quietly from all of us. If you find yourself in an argument, the chances are your opponent is not actually angry with you personally. They were merely carrying their anger when they happened upon your person, and you are merely collateral damage. And in that moment you are the embodiment of another three months of home-schooling or their father’s missing second vaccination jab. You are their forthcoming rent, their vanishing career and their dwindling savings. You are their patchy broadband or the fact that their teenager spends all day not learning but cavorting on social media, while in America a person in charge of nuclear codes is no longer deemed stable enough to have social media. Or perhaps they’ve just not had any fresh air for a long time, because it’s currently a bit tricky to tell what enough fresh air actually is. How long outdoors is acceptable until your need for fresh air is deemed wanton? I often go to Booths after 9pm, when I’m almost the only customer in the store. I pop wet wipes, butter or eggs into my basket, too, but those 10 minutes in the wine aisle with my headphones on while choosing a bottle of gavi or a crémant de Limoux feel, just for a moment, like 1992 on the terrace at Space in Ibiza. A long stare into the chiller cabinet while selecting ice-creams that might soothe a sore palate feels momentarily carefree and hedonistic. I am older and greyer and resemble one of The Flumps more and more, but in my mind’s eye, for these few brief moments, I look like Lady Miss Kier and I’m dancing at 6am in a crowd of sweaty strangers. Sometimes I head back to the veg section to languish for a while by the reduced-price brussels sprouts, just so I can shamelessly enjoy a few more moments of music and hide from terms such as “comfort care” and “palliative”. My iPhone is my slenderest outlet of joy, yet even that has begun sending me warning messages about headphone volume. One odd feature of living, at least for the time being, in the remote north is that supermarket supplies are uneven, which means shortages of the likes of bread when the roads freeze over; but it also means there is just as often a glut of frivolous, luxury items, because there are no longer any tourists to buy them. Banoffee pie was yellow-stickered down from £3.80 to £1.20 yesterday. So pleasing with tea and Tipping Point. I have trouble believing in an interventionist God lately, but I do believe He offers small mercies.','https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/jan/15/sweet-treats-are-abbreviating-these-long-cooped-up-january-days-grace-dent','Grace Dent','Sweet treats are abbreviating these long, cooped-up January days | Grace Dent',-2.45438910000000021,54.2776946999999907,0.700300000000000033);

It was somewhere between the vanilla-flavoured mashed potato and the moment when I realised French celebrity chef Cyril Lignac was not, in fact, cooking in his kitchen during this heavily hyped launch, and was instead jazz-handing about the place in casual clothes and allowing the predominantly French clientele the sumptuous treat of meeting him. “Non, Cyril,” I thought, “ce n’est pas OK. How about putting on some whites and popping backstage to handle more important matters? Perhaps starting with some sort of judicial inquiry into that purée de pommes de terre à la vanille?” Et voilà! There she was, the old pre-pandemic Fenella The Kettle Witch in me. Not dead, after all, just lying dormant. All it took to reawaken her was an eight-quid side of mash that tasted a bit like Birds Eye arctic roll. For this, I should probably thank Cyril. Being relentlessly nice and supportive in restaurants, while secretly planning never to darken their doors again, couldn’t last for ever. It certainly isn’t the fault of Bar des Prés that so many restaurants are run poorly and wasting my lipstick right now. The most serious issue is either a dearth of staff or, worse, a plethora of untrained staff let loose on a dining room floor near you, with no natural flair for the magical fairy dance of hospitality. Meanwhile, anyone with even a modicum of interest in making sure glasses are refilled, orders get to the chef, tables wiped and loo rolls replaced in the ladies seems to have been swiftly promoted to manager – and left to sink or swim. Or poached by the one good place left in town, and on far better wages. As both a customer and critic, I’ve done a lot of smiling graciously in 2021. Because this is all – depending on who you ask – down to Brexit, or the pandemic, or the droves leaving hospitality to rethink their futures, or those others who are re-opening their venues when, if they were honest, they’d rather be at home doing star jumps with Joe Wicks. Or at least a distance-learning reiki healing course, rather than having to make me lunch and endure my cat’s bum tight mouth when they tell me that eight of the 10 items on the menu are unavailable, before leaving a mop bucket in the middle of the aisle for customers to trip over and traipsing off to smoke a fag right outside the window. None of these things, I hasten to add, happened at Bar des Prés. The service is that attentive, smiley, full-eye-contact type; at times, there were as many as four front-of-house staff around me at once, like a barber’s shop quartet, smiling and telling me how wonderful everything is at Bar des Prés, to the point where I began to wonder if I was being softened up to join Cyril’s cult. No, Bar des Prés is actually a beautifully staffed, well-run joint with so much toilet paper I could have made a nest. Its main problem is that it is also a lavishly funded, Franco-east Asian restaurant that began life in Paris and is headed up by a chef who has been called the French Jamie Oliver (but who is largely unrecognisable over here). This means that, to the naked eye, it’s just another fancy Mayfair cocktail bar that serves perfectly OK £17 “margarithais” made with tequila, mezcal and lemongrass, and has a menu that’s part-Japanese – obsiblue prawn sushi, yellowtail and otoru sashimi, spicy tuna tataki; and part-French-Asian – langoustine ravioli with yuzu, or artichoke salad with yet more yuzu, this time in a truffle vinaigrette. The sushi and sashimi are made behind the sit-up bar by skilled chefs and are definitely as decent as an £18 plate of seared tuna Californian roll with nori, Korean spices and, ahem, yuzu soy sauce should be. The few French-ish items on the menu, meanwhile, are many levels of curious. Take “spicy prawn, cos lettuce, sesame seeds”: a bowl of generously dressed, one-note leaves in a sesame oily dressing and a blink-and-you’ll-miss-them garnish of chopped, crisp-coated prawns. Or the duo of excessively sweet slider-style lobster rolls, or those vanilla potatoes that tasted like when your mum bought you a Mr Whippy and you kept hold of it for a bit too long and it dripped warmly down your hand, or the really rather burnt, but still a signature dish nevertheless, millefeuille with pecan nut praline. That last featured three of the ingredients I adore most in the world, but here it was a plate of punishingly sweet tooth glue. Yes, I am aware that I am whinging about my not very nice pudding hell. And, yes, I can hear the world’s teeny-tiniest baroque violin playing for me and my distended gullet as I push another dinner into my spoilt cakehole. But I just want to say that, for the first time since the pandemic, I am openly narked about a not-very-good restaurant. I won’t lie: feeling this bad feels quite good. • Bar des Prés 16 Albemarle Street, London W1, 020-3908 2000. Open all week, noon-11pm (Sun 10pm).

Starters £4-£9.50, mains £7.50-£20.50, pastel de nata £1.50, wines from £14.99 Sometimes restaurants call to me. Sometimes I just don’t listen. Casa Madeira is one of those restaurants. I have driven past it hundreds of times. It is on my route home from the centre of London: south over Lambeth Bridge, right along Albert Embankment, and there it is tucked into the railway arches under the line from Waterloo. The pavement here, in the shadow of the MI6 building, edges a wide terrace given over to outside dining. Over the years I have glanced at the tables beneath the umbrellas as I have passed, at clusters of people leaning in over their plates, and thought that it looked like fun. I’ve thought I should go there. Then I haven’t gone there. Still, I’ve eaten some of Madeira’s food. You may well have done, too. These arches were originally occupied by the Madeira Bakery and Café, which opened in the 1980s and specialises in pastéis de nata, burnished Portuguese tarts in their cups of pure flaky pastry, which always make life better. Business boomed and by 2005 they had to move to a dedicated production site in Wandsworth. On a good day they can make 30,000. If you’ve ever eaten a pastel de nata in London, it probably came from them. They converted the arches into a trio of businesses. To the left is a spartan café. To the right is a well-stocked deli. In the middle is the restaurant. They also have a bar a short distance away on South Lambeth Road, the heart of London’s Portuguese community, but this is the mothership. Needing somewhere by which to mark a particular moment in my life, I book a table for six. The fact is I love the most familiar bits of the Portuguese repertoire. I was once properly addicted to the food served at a grill house on Brixton Hill, originally called the Gallery. They did the best piri piri chicken, a spatchcocked wonder of smoky char and chilli and salt. They did fabulous grilled ribs and chorizo, a denser, meatier version than its Spanish cousin. They did a small number of things very well. Back behind the takeaway was a hilarious, windowless restaurant, with a minstrel gallery and kitsch murals where they served ludicrously good value mixed grills, and dishes of clams and thumb-thick prawns. One of the owners died, the remaining owner sold up, the quality deteriorated and then a fire closed them altogether for a year or two. I miss the Gallery. So instead, here I am at last, on the outside terrace at Casa Madeira, beneath umbrellas equipped with heaters that cast a ripe orange glow and then cut out for a minute of gloom, before suddenly reilluminating. Around us sits a mixed crowd – suited and booted men who I decide are spies from MI6, a younger set in serious puffas against the cold rippling off the Thames just over the road, a few families. Uniformed waiters work these tables, vigorously. The service has a sweet and solicitous air to it. There’s a lot of opening out of stands at the side of each table for trays from the kitchen. While there are certainly enough waiters, there may not be quite enough people working the grill out back given a couple of lengthy waits. Cultivate patience. But the food, when it arrives, is everything. I feel foolish for not having been here before. Rugged bread arrives with little foil-lidded pots of a salty sardine or mackerel pâté. We all dig in. I remind the other elders at the table that it’s a snap for the fish paste of our youth. We conclude that’s why we like it. We place an order of dishes to share. Thick lengths of taut-skinned chorizo arrive perched in custom-designed terracotta dishes with a well of booze at the bottom to be ignited. Broad blue flames gutter and spin for a good few minutes at the end of the table. It lends hunks of the chorizo a welcome char and splits the skin so the juices run. We have a deep bowl of thumbnail-sized white clams, in a garlicky broth which demands to be finished off by the bread, and grilled prawns which have been split open and generously smothered with piri piri sauce. Mains are variations on the same theme, which is what we’re here for. There is very little in the way of flummery coming out of that kitchen. It is solid ingredients, treated with due care and attention. There are mixed grills, with chicken and pork escalopes, a little more chorizo and the stars of the show, expertly trimmed lamb chops. We have grilled sardines, their silvery skins blistered and curled, so that the flesh comes away from the bone, and a stew of pork with more clams which provides further opportunities for bread moppage. Chips are hot and crisp. Salads are fresh and vinegary. We finish, of course, with a pastel de nata each and they are still warm, so everything is perfect. The pastry flakes down our coats. The sweet, set custard coats our mouths. Prices are reasonable and in places extraordinary. The specials blackboard offers a whole turbot for three or four people for £55. I’m told it needs to be sold today and that normally it would be around £75. I tell him about the £135 at Brat at Climpson’s Arch. He laughs. “We couldn’t charge that here,” he says. I’m sure they couldn’t. That’s not a complaint. At the end they bring us each a thimble glass of a dark, caramel-coloured madeira and we toast what is, for me, a last night of freedom. As restaurants are finally opening up, I am closing down. The next day I will begin two weeks of self-isolation ahead of the hip replacement I’ve been banging on about elsewhere in this newspaper. It’s also one of the reasons, alongside the small matter of a raging pandemic, I’ve not been leaving London. I will start reviewing again across the whole of the UK as soon as I can. So enough with the complaining emails already. Magazine deadlines being what they are, this piece was written before it happened, but you’re reading it after the deed has been done. I will already have been fitted with a spiffing new ceramic hip. I will be part man, part crockery. So no swanning around those restaurants for me for a short while. Instead, some fabulous people will be keeping my seat at the table warm, by telling you about restaurants they love. See you very soon. News bites The news of new openings keeps coming. Edinburgh-based chefs Sam Yorke and Tomás Gormley, with experience between them working with Tom Kitchin, the late Andrew Fairlie and at the Lookout by Gardeners Cottage, are to turn their pop-up supper club into a permanent fixture. The high-end Heron will open this summer on a site on The Shore in Leith, and will have an à la carte menu that will change every few weeks. At the other end of Britain in Lewes, East Sussex, chef Richard Falk, who spent five years at Robin Gill’s highly regarded Dairy in south London, is to open Fork. He’s describing the modern British menu as ‘innovative yet accessible’, which is a phrase broadly open to interpretation. The opening menu promises flank steak with salsa verde and smoked bone marrow, lamb rack and offal with wilted gem, anchovy and capers and English strawberries with whipped yoghurt, elderflower and feuilletine. Visit fork-lewes.co.uk. And (kind of) between the two in Manchester, the Deansgate Square development has just welcomed the arrival of Atomeca, an all-day venue with a drink offering from the award-winning bartending brothers Joe and Daniel Schofield and wine expert James Brandwood. To soak it all up there’s a short Spanish-inflected food menu of cheese and charcuterie plates, tostadas and habas fritas.

Starters £13.50-£24.50, mains £23.50-£56, desserts £8.75-£10.50, wines from £35.50 Looking up Swallow Street from a deserted Piccadilly, the current incarnation of Bentley’s presents as a warm, glowing pool of light amid the darkness. As we get closer, we can hear a babble of voices. I want mine to be a part of that babble, a murmur of basso profundo to bottom out the high notes. Happily, that’s about to happen. I have bagged a table and I did so courtesy of a cunning ruse. I texted the chef and asked for one. Stop scowling. Much has been said recently about the arrival of outside dining; about the thrill of the regathered herd, of food cooked by others and the joyous subcontracting of washing-up. Less has been said about the savage battle for bookings. People have been grabbing for slots like addicts desperate for a fix – which, in a way, I suppose they are. The tables are few. The diners are many. The struggle is real. Drastic measures are called for. In any case what scant anonymity I have is useless here, not because I do this job, but because I am a regular. I even have a favoured stool at the marble-topped oyster bar and I’m not ashamed of the fact: it’s the one three in from the door to the kitchen. As we emerge from the worst year for the restaurant business in living memory, I wanted to write about a classic restaurant – the kind of place I daydreamed about in the depths of lockdown; the one that always makes me think everything will be OK. That had to be Bentley’s. It first opened in 1916, standing proud on an L-shaped lane that runs between Piccadilly and Regent Street and which, some years ago, was pedestrianised, making it ideally suited to outside dining and not getting run over. I last reviewed it in 2005 when the chef Richard Corrigan had just taken over and restored it to its classy seafood glory. The night I visited he was behind the bar, furiously shucking oysters, apparently oblivious to the blood dripping down his meaty forearm from where he had stabbed himself multiple times. He was suffering for our dinner. I have returned often to that downstairs bar and sat, elbow to elbow, slurping oysters off the half-shell, while squinting at the eccentric handwriting on the specials chalkboard listing dishes that never feel forced. Corrigan long ago withdrew to the kitchen leaving the oyster shucking to Helio Garzon, a sardonic soul with half a century’s experience prising recalcitrant bivalves open. I have spent ages watching him, while sipping something cold and crisp. Dinner and a show, and so on. There is a softer-edged dining room upstairs, but I’ve never felt the need to visit. I want the bustle here. Mostly I want the great seafood, treated with respect. I love the treacly soda bread, and the green-flecked seaweed butter to go with it. The lemon is always muslin-wrapped. The classics are always executed properly. The innovations are always considered. The fizz is cold. Just hold your nose when the bill comes. Great seafood costs. Perhaps get yourself a government contract you are completely unqualified to deliver. That should pay for it. Throughout the pandemic, I spoke often to Corrigan. I heard the agony in his voice as he described negotiating with landlords or dismissed the idea of taking government loans as a fool’s errand. Now, after the stop-start of the past year, they are back. We’re not allowed inside, of course. Garzon may well be in there, working his blade into hinge after hinge without flinching. We must be out here seated amid the longer director’s cut of their patio-dining operation. It has, I’m told, been an uneven re-entry. We often describe great restaurants as finely oiled machines. But the cogs in that machine are human beings and sometimes they take a little while to slip into gear with each other. Tonight, however, this version of Bentley’s, beneath umbrellas and heaters, is running on well-oiled tracks. Orders are taken. Trays appear, held high. Here and there a crab limb dangles casually over the edge of a silver bowl, like Tallulah Bankhead’s leg draped off a chaise longue. We choose both British classics and dishes with the flavours of elsewhere. From the classic side of the equation, we get the English shellfish cocktail. It’s essentially a compact fruits de mer, in which all the hard work has already been done. Atop shredded lettuce, there are generous amounts of both white and brown crabmeat side by side, spun through with nutty brown shrimps. There are finger-thick Atlantic prawns and a lobster claw and, resting across the top, eyeing you down, a butch, sturdy langoustine, its hinged claws cupping the bowl, as if shielding the contents from pilferers. Hands off. Our classic main is the Bentley’s fish pie. A piped and golden mashed potato top gives way to smoked haddock, salmon and prawns, all bound in a mustard-boosted sauce. It is a fish pie made by someone who understands the engineering of the dish. It is the essence of a PG Wodehouse novel, enclosed within a ceramic dish. It is not my first Bentley’s fish pie. It won’t be my last. From the other side of the coin comes what they call their “Vietnamese” dressed raw oysters, with a rosé-pink broth punchy with sweet citrus and salty fish sauce, and topped with coriander leaves and tiny battered rings of deep-fried shallot. There is a sprightly ceviche of thinly sliced scallop and gurnard with lime and chilli, and then a Goan-inflected curry of prawns and monkfish with vigorous vinegary notes. It is the same language of seafood, only with a modulated accent. Here, the ingredients are king. To finish there is a choux bun, with a crunchy caramel glaze, back-filled with a hazelnut cream. There is also a set lemon cream so pointedly citrus-sharp it makes you shiver, but in a good way, topped with splodges of gooseberry purée and meringues like nipple tassels. Or maybe they’re just like my nipple tassels. A great restaurant experience is all about the self, isn’t it? Late in the evening, Corrigan appears from the kitchen. He will not pretend. It’s been a bruising year, and he carries those marks upon his back. But Bentley’s is still standing as it has stood for over a century. The wine is still being poured. The food is still coming out of the kitchen. The pandemic didn’t deal the knockout blow. We give thanks for all of that and drain another glass. News bites The Sri Lankan street food operator Hop and Roll has branched out into hopper kits, providing everything you need to make the famed Sri Lankan fermented rice batter pancakes at home. A hopper kit including the pan, with enough ingredients for 20 hoppers, is £39.99 and it’s £25 without the pan. You can also add the makings of pol sambol, the island’s great coconut-based condiment, devilled potatoes and cocktails. Delivery is across much of Britain, visit hopandroll.co.uk. Land, the excellent plant-based restaurant in Birmingham which I enjoyed enormously when I visited last summer, has launched a modest crowdfunder to enable them to relocate within the Victorian shopping arcade they already call home. As they say they have managed to get through the pandemic by selling meal boxes and gift vouchers, but are a little short. Rewards for pledged funds include cooking lessons and various discounts and vouchers. You can donate here. And the big news from the London restaurant world, first reported by Marina O’Loughlin, late of this parish: Russell Norman, famed for his role in setting up the Polpo group, has announced his next move. He says the food at his forthcoming Trattoria Brutto will come from the heart of Italy but ‘with a Tuscan accent’. It should open sometime in the summer.

Or, more accurately, when The Parkers Arms’ “at home” quince pudding with custard was left at my front door. My choice was between giving up sugar for 40 days in a bid to re-learn the concept of sacrifice and self-discipline, or letting this structurally perfect, moist, delicate, syrupy masterpiece go to waste. “What would Jesus want?” I wondered while snaffling the entire tray like a Hungry Hippo. Soon after, I ate a piece of handmade, extra-thick millionaire’s shortbread at Tebay on the M6, which is less a service station than a delightful artisan farmshop and organic beeswax moisturiser boutique with added petrol pumps. I love Tebay because it is so wilfully bizarre. You cannot buy anything as gauche as a Krispy Kreme donut, but you can get a ukulele and an Easy Ukulele Party Classics songbook. Supporting Tebay Services at a time when few people are travelling also felt very holy on my part. “Remind me again what Lent is?” asked my partner Charles, who is Jewish, as I shook the bag to dislodge all the particles of chocolate stuck inside, then straightened the edges to pour that delicious bounty down my gullet. “Lent,” I began confidently, “is a period of abstinence to commemorate Jesus spending 40 days and 40 nights in the, um, wilderness.” My last Lent refresher course was at Sunday school in 1977, where my parents sent me so they could glean two hours of glorious silence in which to read the Sunday Post and eat toast. “Why was he in the wilderness?” asked Charles, having never read as far as the New Testament. “He went to the wilderness to prepare for, er, something,” I replied, “so Christians give up things like sugar or meat, or rollerblading. Although that was in Father Ted, so it’s not really a thing.” Neither my partner nor I is staunchly religious, yet there is enough floating about in our noggins from our respective childhoods to influence how, when and what we eat. For him, that means never pork and fasting on certain holidays. I’ve even made raspberry jam hamantaschen for Purim. But it wasn’t until I lived in an inter-faith household that I realised just how weird my side could sound, or how much I liked my own framework of eccentric dos and don’ts. Whether or not you believe in God, they just seem to make the year feel more neat, and give you a little path back to a place that was once safe. “This Easter, I’m making Pace eggs,” I announced recently. (With another matriarch now gone from my family, I feel pressure to step up to the plate.) “I’m dying boiled eggs in their shells, using onion skins, to make natural fractal patterns. Then we can roll them down a hill on Easter Sunday.” Admittedly, this felt a lot more sane inside my head, because now it sounded as if we were extras in The Wicker Man. Didn’t everyone’s household chase boiled eggs down a steep bank to pay tribute to the resurrection? What about eating pigeon peas with malt vinegar and butter on the fifth Sunday in Lent (leading to some frankly unholy gastrointestinal explosions)? Does this not all make perfect sense? Of course, the lead-up to Easter runs parallel with the lead-up to Passover, which has its own restrictions, recipes, and things to be gathered and done. I will never be Jewish, but I have felt the high tension of trying to locate the last box of Rakusen’s “Kosher for Passover” matzo crackers within the M25 on the Thursday before Pesach. Believe me, when I saw that solo box on the ransacked shelf in Buckhurst Hill Waitrose, it felt like a religious experience. Less so when I tried to turn them into matzo cracker lasagne – they do not substitute for pasta; do not believe the hype. Within this lifetime, I hope to get to the bottom of why Charles can but can’t eat kidney beans during Pesach, even if a rabbinical assembly in 2014 said it’s OK, probably. “Jesus went to the wilderness to fast and prepare for ministry,” I said, checking Google while picking caramel out of my fillings, “which is why I’ve given up sweet things.” If it turns out there really is a heaven, I hope God isn’t into details.','https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/feb/26/doesnt-everyone-chase-boiled-eggs-down-a-hill-to-pay-tribute-to-the-resurrection-grace-dent','Grace Dent','Doesn’t everyone chase boiled eggs down a hill to pay tribute to the resurrection? | Grace Dent',-2.45438910000000021,54.2776946999999907,0.340000000000000024);

On the day we were finally allowed to gather around an outside restaurant table, we awoke to find it was snowing. That TS Eliot knew a thing or two; April really can be the cruellest month. Still, where dogged fun is concerned, we are a stubborn if ludicrous breed. Just ask anyone who has ever sat on a British beach in a howling gale, with bare, vein-mottled thighs like corned beef, pretending it’s summer. We regard it as character forming. Anyhow, I had a plan to mitigate the chill. The outdoor rules demand that whatever form of cover is in place, at least 50% of the sides must be open to the elements. The solution for these early, tentative steps was to go somewhere that barely had to adapt to comply with the rules. Hence, I booked into Brat at Climpson’s Arch in London’s Hackney, where wood-fired grills flick blood-red sparks into the night sky. The covered space here is a large but temporary shed, a rigid-framed marquee that looks like it wants to be a proper building when it grows up. Roll up the sides. Take the doors off the hinges. Job done. In 2012, before making his name as head chef at Kitty Fishers, Tomos Parry ran a pop-up at Climpson’s. In 2018 he opened his own restaurant in a wood-panelled space in Shoreditch, and won gongs aplenty. It’s called Brat, an old English word for turbot which, slow grilled over smouldering embers until the vinegar-spritzed skin somehow both crisps and softens, became the menu’s star turn. Last summer, with various restrictions in place, Parry decided to return to Climpson’s Arch. It was meant to be a temporary residency, but is now looking permanent. So here we are on our first night out of captivity, trying not to be feral. We are endlessly pleased with ourselves simply for having booked a table. We are overcome with gratitude for the ministrations of these cheery waiters in their loose denim uniforms. Fairy lights are strung overhead. There are wobbly tables and a scribbled blackboard menu full of dishes that read like sweet promises. There are patio heaters, some of which even work. The air smells of smoke-grilled seafood; a deep and encouraging seashore funk wafts around, here by the north London train lines. I loved the bricks-and-mortar version of Brat. I swooned over seemingly effortless cooking of a sort that takes deep wells of patience and skill. I liked the modernist cafeteria vibe. But I love this space a little more. It has a rackety, freestyle vibe. And oh, how the food sings. At the heart of the menu are big, showy wood-grilled sharing items, at big showy prices. Those prices will make the comments section below this piece online froth and bubble like a fart-filled bath. If you’re going to look, take popcorn. But if you want a whole turbot, you shouldn’t expect it to be a cheap. Get the large one for four people and it will cost you £135. The beef rib for four is £120, or two of you can dismantle a vast wood-grilled Cornish crab for £55. These prices include sides: grilled hispi cabbage and smoked potatoes, awash with butter and bursting from their skins. Tonight, there are many takers for all this. We see the crabs and turbots parade past us like headliners for Sunday Night at the Palladium. We go another way, heading into the smaller plates, priced at between £6.50 and £16. After we’ve placed our order, our lovely waiter says, “That’s all quite rich.” We ask if there’s anything that isn’t rich. He nods. “Fair point.” Our first dish is lightness itself: brilliant green spears of asparagus cooked so they still have bite, with a thick puddle of fresh, creamy cheese for dredging. Despite this morning’s snow, it is proof that spring is here. We have a plate spread with both rust-coloured velvet crabs, broken into body and leg, and large, shiny mussels, opened over wood smoke, alongside discs of rough-textured chorizo. Prepare to get your hands sticky. Indulge in suckage and slurpage. Use the napkins. We are advised to order a Bible-thick slab of their grilled and buttered white bread for sauce-mopping purposes, for all these good things have given the best of themselves to the plate. It is a very good steer. There’s also a fearsomely hot cast-iron skillet with a soupy mess of white beans laid with a spicy morcilla-style blood sausage and split langoustines grilled until the tails have just emerged from translucent. Dribbles of a strident salsa verde bring it all together. It is deft, sensitive cooking in the service of seriously classy ingredients. A mutton chop is enthusiastically fire-grilled but still the pink of a Provençal rosé within. Buried beneath a sweet, taut-skinned tomato salad is a boisterous sausage made from the offal. We also have a shatteringly crisp fritto misto of hake, squid and courgettes, with fronds of deep-fried green herbs. It is all sigh- and swoon-worthy. Around us happy chatter rises and so does the smoke from the open kitchen; I know that the next morning the coat I have worn against the bitter cold will smell of the night before. I am warm in so many ways. Desserts are engineered for a restaurant with a lot to do on service: a caramel cream or baked cheesecake with rhubarb, both of which can be made earlier in the day and dished up as needed. That cheesecake is the ideal sweet-soft foil for the pink, glossy sour-sweet rhubarb. The wine list has lots of natural twist and turns. Just tell your waiter you don’t want anything that smells like it’s been filtered through the arse end of a pig and they’ll find you something crisp and friendly – in our case a bright white from Crete. You thought lockdown might have changed me? Nah. I still don’t want my glass filled with a liquid that suggests the winemaker hates me. A restaurant is never the sum of its dishes, however good they are and these are very good indeed. It is a mood and a sensibility; it’s the babble of voices, the clink of a glass and the chime of cutlery on porcelain. It is a sense of wellbeing and it can’t be forced. Brat at Climpson’s Arch has it. I leave with the glow of a man who knows he’s chosen well. It was the right place to begin this restaurant reviewing business once more. News bites Like many people I have spent the past year cooking in culinary traditions I hadn’t previously investigated at home before. The biggest challenge, especially with east Asian dishes, is obtaining ingredients. Happily, there has been an expansion of the online shopping options covering much of Britain. The newest and perhaps most niche is C&amp;R Marketplace which offers a small range of Malaysian ingredients including instant rendang sauces, laksa pastes and even durian cakes (cnr-deli.com). Korean ingredients are now served by the online arm of Osyeo, the UK’s largest Korean retailer. There you can find over 1,100 products from whole cabbage kimchi and gochujang through to bulgogi marinades and seaweed snacks. You can even get a K-Pop CD to entertain you while you cook (hmart.co.uk). Finally, the magnificent SeeWoo Chinese supermarket in London’s Chinatown has an online shop offering a massive range of products including frozen dim sum, chilli oils, pastes and instant noodles (seewoouk.com). And finally, another new opening. The five-bedroom Glebe guest house in Colyton, East Devon has been taken over by Hugo Guest, son of the original founders, and his partner Olive. From 17 May it will have a small restaurant offering both ‘simple suppers’ – cassoulets and pies and so on – throughout the week, plus a four-course £48 Italian-inflected menu from Thursday to Sunday. Ingredients will come from close by including their own smallholding. Expect house salamis, wild garlic tortellini in brodo, smoked eel tartare and a rhubarb and custard tart (glebehousedevon.co.uk).

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(202,'2021-03-26T10:00:41Z','If we must eat outside, I won’t let a bit of trench foot spoil a picnic | Grace Dent','After the initial burst of glee that many of us felt on seeing the roadmap to recovery back in February, a quieter realism has set in. All dining until mid-May at least – which is an arduously long period – will involve eating outside. Notice that I did not say “eating outdoors”, which is that first, delicious mouthful of Cornish pasty on a windswept beach or a sandwich pulled from a plastic box halfway up Scafell Pike. In these cases, food tastes better outdoors. Eating “outside”, on the other hand, is very different. This is when your local landlord assembles a £25 Dunelm gazebo in a loading bay and passes it off as a “deluxe dining terrace”. Eating outside is what London’s fancier restaurants are actually promising, with their VIP rooftop greenhouses, bottomless champagne pool cabanas and heated pergolas. All of this is a fig leaf over the cold, hard truth: it’s likely to be 11C out there, so pack a bobble hat and wear thermal knickers. Still, if outside is all we’re permitted for now, and it’s a way to kickstart the economy, then I’m committing to the cause. We ponder a lot about British values – these days, they are mysterious, contentious and ever-moving – but one I will suggest is a defiance in the face of bad weather, and an in-built determination not to let a bit of trench foot spoil a picnic; to keep buggering on regardless of soggy bunting, flooded lawns and rain-battered marquees. If anything, in fact, we have as a nation trained all our lives for 12 April 2021, when hospitality can at last reopen, at least outside. From childhood, we are honed to expect any seaside trip to involve at least one hour cowering from hailstones in a bus shelter while eating foil-wrapped luncheon-meat baps. At Alton Towers, it is almost imperative to enter the log flume already soaked to the skin, while Glastonbury works almost as well when it is a mud bath, because a spirit of dogged, cider-fuelled joie de vivre sets in. Godspeed to the families I’ve observed this week picnicking on lino draped across puddles of mud in Crystal Palace Park and passing around a Cath Kidston cake tin with quiet stoicism. Sandwiches had been made, sandwiches had been packed, so sandwiches would be eaten, and at any cost. This is partly why, I feel, hospitality premises across the land are currently hammering up lean-tos and investing in outdoors heaters. The roadmap to freedom isn’t exactly as we’d prefer it – southern France’s temperatures, say, would be lovely – but we’ve been indoors too long, we miss each other, so build it, and we will come. Of course, by now you may be thinking, “Grace is right, perhaps we should make a reservation for April. Frank at the Bull &amp; Bush is opening a sun terrace.” Well, I’m sorry to inform you that you’re too late. Britain is already booked up, and will be until late autumn. While everyday polite and cautious folk have shilly-shallied about thinking they should probably make a booking, be aware that a hyper-organised element of society has for the foreseeable future reserved every patio seat, every afternoon tea sun terrace, every weekend dinner table and, for that matter, every holiday cottage in the British Isles. There are two ways of looking at this. The first is that it is incredibly positive for hospitality that all booking platforms have been swamped by diligent pre-bookers dying to throw money at our cash-starved pubs and restaurants. The other is to be concerned that British hospitality, for the last two weeks of April, is now fully at the mercy of punters who are sitting on dozens of reservations, hedging their bets for nice weather, and those who make multiple reservations on the same night and simply choose where they fancy on the day, leaving all their other tables empty. Sometimes, these diners also cancel at the last minute and, when told a deposit will be taken, retreat to TripAdvisor to bleat about the manager’s cruelty. As I catapult around restaurant reservation platforms, what I see tells me that Britain is open and I’ve gone from having nothing in my diary to having missed the boat already. At the park, thank God, walk-ins are still welcome, so I’ll meet you by the seesaw and I’ll bring some lino. Mine’s a can of gin and tonic. No ice needed.','https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/mar/26/if-we-must-eat-outside-i-wont-let-a-bit-of-trench-foot-spoil-a-picnic','Grace Dent','If we must eat outside, I won’t let a bit of trench foot spoil a picnic | Grace Dent',-2.45438910000000021,54.2776946999999907,0.421499999999999985);

Starters £10, mains £14, desserts £10, wines from £24 On the wall of the space housing this week’s restaurant is a sign which reads: “A brilliantly cheeky twist on classic British food.” There is a lot to unpack here, not least the second word; I’ll be the judge of that and so on. Even before you get to that sign, you have to confront the name of the restaurant. It’s called Only Food and Courses. That’s boss-level punnery right there, but just about excusable, I think. The restaurant is located inside Pop Brixton, the loose-limbed food-and-drink market built out of converted shipping containers that is only a couple of miles from Peckham, the setting for John Sullivan’s sitcom Only Fools and Horses. Geddit? Sure you do. Let’s step back for a moment: a punning name; a cheeky twist; a shipping container. I can well imagine certain people getting quite cross and sweary. At various times those people might well be me. In the face of cheeky twists I have, in the past, come over all Charlton Heston at the end of the original Planet of the Apes, dropping to his knees in despair before a shattered Statue of Liberty. Although only metaphorically. With my hip issues, it can take a while to get up again. The saving grace here, I think, is the setting. It is impossible for chef Robbie Lorraine and manager Martyn Barrett, who mostly manages himself, to get too serious and up themselves when their home is a shipping container. In another life, it could quite easily have been part of an intestinal blockage on the Suez Canal. I peek inside. It’s nicely done out: clean, white tiling and an open kitchen at the back. But none of that disguises its true nature. When we visit it is, of course, outside eating only. There is space for a dozen of us just beyond the doors on a raised wooden platform up above the rest of Pop Brixton. We eat off tables of the purest plank and are shielded from the spring sunshine by thick, transparent plastic screens the colour of boiled sweets. The filtered light plays havoc with my Instagram pics. In normal times they will be operating as a supper club serving six courses to just 14 people, in two sittings inside, for £65 a head. The menu will change on a monthly basis. As a stopgap, they have devised a short daytime menu of just 10 dishes, which will continue: four starters, four mains, two desserts. This means the bill can mount up, but then there is both serious attention to detail and hard work on show here. Just expect every dish description to be gently misleading and, at times, wilfully so. The business part of a bloody Mary, for example, arrives in the form of a boozy, fiery granita, the ice shards looking like something chipped from Superman’s fortress of solitude. It’s a neat trick given the low freezing point of vodka. It comes with long-roasted tomatoes, chickpea chips and a dill oil that has, through a bit of old-school Blumenthal-esque modernism, been processed into a powder. Not so much an annoying deconstruction as a reconfiguration. Ham, egg and chips has all those things. Except the ham element is a compressed tangle of piggy terrine, the eggs are just the cured yolks and there are more of those chickpea chips. Whorls of pea purée and rings of sweet pickled onion complete the plate. Ignore the title and what you have is a cheery, well-executed dish. And so, to the prawn cocktail that both is and isn’t. The Marie Rose sauce has been put through a nitrous gun so it sits in aerated pillows around the prawns. It’s dotted with tiny spherifications of balsamic vinegar, another old-school technique developed by Ferran Adrià at El Bulli back in the 90s, when playing with your food like this was all the rage. There are ribbons of pickled cucumber and some charred lettuce. It is indeed a prawn cocktail, just not your prawn cocktail. Let’s finish this round with slices of extremely good treacle-cured salmon, laid with puffed wheat, fronds of green herbs and a Jenga block of crème fraîche formed into a jelly. Our first main, a smoked short-rib hash, is the closest to a familiar dish and, being formed into a tower, has a sweet 90s nostalgia to it: there is a pedestal of crushed potatoes upon which sits the long-braised beef, all of it drenched in a slowly reduced jus, the last dribbles of which I chase around the plate with fat finger pads. Is that only me? After that, it’s pure whimsy all the way. There’s a perfectly made scotch egg, in which the pork has been replaced by white crab meat. The yolk is running and there is a sizeable spoonful of glistening caviar to make sure it’s dressed properly for the occasion. Duck eclairs are fairly described: slices of crisp-shelled choux pastry bun are split and filled with shredded, salty duck confit and glazed with a jus, then decorated with edible flowers. There are three of us at the table and three eclairs on the plate. I ask if it’s the normal portion. I’m told the standard portion size is two, but if there happen to be three people at the table, they send out a third. They do the same with the lobster doughnuts, which are indeed deep-fried doughnuts, filled with mayo-bound lobster, and dusted with beetroot powder. Do I need to tell you that both of these are delicious? Desserts bring the only misfire. In a Bakewell slice the cherries have been replaced with beetroot. This does not make it a better Bakewell or even an intriguingly different Bakewell. It just makes it weird and disappointing. Beetroot may be sweet, but it can still have a vegetal, musty edge, pointed up by the pieces of golden beetroot on the plate. Far better is an extremely well-made lemon meringue tart with toasted meringue peaks and fat spherified pearls which burst with a sweet, lemony syrup, the very essence of a sherbet dib dab. Did the repeated mismatch between dish name and contents, the cheeky twistiness of it all, make your palms itchy? Fair enough. I understand. But I direct you to how seriously I’ve taken this cooking because, for all that whimsy, it deserves to be taken seriously. Only Food and Courses is a careful exercise in misdirection. But it’s a sweet and benign one. Plus, it results in duck eclairs and lobster doughnuts. How could anyone seriously complain about that? News bites Chef and restaurateur Mike Robinson, known for the game-focused Harwood Arms in London, is opening a third restaurant inside a newly launched Indigo Hotel. Following on from the Woodsman in Stratford-upon-Avon and The Elder in Bath (which I reviewed last summer) comes The Forge, in Chester. It launches next Wednesday, 19 May. The opening menu includes a wood pigeon salad with bacon and black pudding, grilled haunch of wild fallow deer and a cherry bakewell souffle. At theforgechester.com. The chef Mark Greenaway, who made his name at a number of well received restaurants in Edinburgh, has branched out into pie and mash. The first outpost of Greenaway’s Pie and Mash has recently opened on Villiers Street next to London’s Charing Cross station. The pie options cost £6 each and include a beef short rib with pearl onion, a confit duck with lentils and orange, and a vegan mince with red wine and rosemary. Toppings, including mash, mushy peas, gravy and parsley liquor, cost about £1 extra. Visit greenawayspies.com. Nico Simeone, the chef behind a group of tasting menu-based restaurants called Six by Nico in Edinburgh, London, Belfast, Manchester and Liverpool is to open a second venture in Glasgow, with all profits going to the Beatson Cancer Charity. The Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre treated Simeone’s wife, Valentina, when she was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 2015.

I’ve watched agog on Instagram as an ambitious timber pergola with a corrugated plastic roof was hammered, glued and hoisted together at Mike’s, a brand new pizza place in Peckham, south-east London. Think Noah’s ark, but with slow-fermented, twice-baked dough festooned with ostentatious toppings and served with cold bottles of Breton cider in the back of a business park/artistic space. Mike’s intends to cope whether it rains, snows or shines. I went last Thursday lunchtime, in its opening week, dressed for both Club 55 in St Tropez and Captain Scott’s 1910 Terra Nova expedition all at the same time. Well, it pays to be prepared. And, gosh, I wanted lunch, too, and the team at Mike’s (who are also behind Frank’s Cafe, also in Peckham, and the Camberwell Arms) were offering a wooden refuge from all the pain of the past 12 months. Everything about Mike’s is deceptively down-at-heel. There’s a humble, single-sheet menu written up in a bright, ketchup-red font on a stark, white background. It looks more like a flyer, to be honest, while mini-cab offices have gone bigger on the branding. There are a couple of starters, six or seven pizza options daily, and a beguiling wine list of rossos and biancos that also features five low-intervention, skin-contact choices by the glass. OK, yes, there are those alarm bells. We’re not in Pizza Express now. You won’t get a glass of warm primitivo with a dishwasher tidemark here. Mike’s is clandestine fancy, even if it is down a back street and opposite a CrossFit gym. The lupe pizza, for example, features sweet, pale pink Tropea onions on a bed of mascarpone, mozzarella and pecorino. It is utterly delicious, almost cake-like, unforgettable and clearly antagonistic, because much of the text on Mike’s website is devoted to placating those who want to argue about what should or should not be on a pizza. “At Mike’s, we’ll be making a style of pizza all of our own,” they say, while serving pineapple on pizza with scotch bonnet pickled onions. The menu changes frequently, and when I went last week there was a pizza with radicchio, gorgonzola and walnuts that was really quite incredible. Plus a pork belly and chard one. The slices of pizza are served on long, wooden boards, but fear not, plates are available, as are chilli oil, aïoli and anchovy ketchup, if any of those floats your boat. I’d suggest ordering three slices per person (or more, if you are especially hungry or greedy), because this is serious, rather heavy-going pizza that aims to leave you stuffed. The dough has been laboured over, tended to, checked, re-checked and loved dearly. This isn’t Chicago Town or Dr Oetker; no one is hitting the Hut. Mike’s pizza is secretly posh and definitely ever so pleasing. Even the humble gem lettuce side salad, dressed heavily in more Tropea onion, herbs and crumbs, is a delight. During those long, cooped-up March days, as I geared up for Mike’s, I read and re-read the menu, drooling unattractively over their promise to make me supplì. This is a sort of Italian croquette, or an arancino on steroids, that you rarely see on British menus, which is a shame, because it’s perfect with a cold glass of vermouth and soda in the spring sunshine. The hot, deep-fried bullets served at Mike’s are stuffed with scamorza, fregola and saffron and formed into delicate balls. This is a dish that’s a strong example of why we bother to put on pants with zips and leave the house to eat out at all: because life is simply too short to make your own supplì. Not that it’s an insurmountable task, but I’ve tasted chef Andrea Angelini’s crumbly, oozing handiwork, and here is a man who can raise the status of “crunchy, cheesy, fried thing” into a sort of noble art. Order at least six supplì. In fact, I’d consider even going for these alone and have them with a side of shaved grezzina courgette with a blood orange and mint dressing. For pudding, we shared a structureless bowl of mascarpone with pistachios and rhubarb, which felt a bit like nursery food, but I wasn’t complaining. I am in the marketplace to be treated like a cosseted child in numerous establishments for the remainder of 2021, being spoonfed delightful, made-from-scratch morsels by people, nay, angels, who have made it their actual career to make members of the public happier.

Not that Soreen doesn’t make a fine emergency snack: I could hurl that dark, squidgy goodness down my gullet by the yard. The fact is that, in normal times, finding food on the go is never difficult. Airports are especially adept at removing money from my wallet, catering to my whims and lulling me into that hazy sweet spot when mealtimes are irrelevant and it seems perfectly normal to be slurping Wagamama ramen and drinking sake at 7am. Because why not? It must be dinner time somewhere. But on this particular day at City Airport, almost everyone involved with the country’s food industry was furloughed, on very reduced hours or had been let go in the latest round of downsizings. Travelling around Britain for work during the pandemic, I’m reminded constantly of how curious and muted a land is without restaurants, bars and cafes. Love or loathe the likes of Pret, Costa Coffee and Yo! Sushi, but their neon lights would glow as I walked along high streets, through shopping malls or to my aeroplane, signifying that human life was here and that everyday life was functioning. Lights on in a distant Pret have saved my sad soul on more than one occasion, as I’ve fallen through the door and taken the last pea and mint soup. I now often wonder if normal will ever happen again. Perhaps not if the only people permitted to travel are individuals such as myself, who are providing “vital services”. I know, stop laughing. My family has been in light hysteria about this for weeks now. It’s almost as if they do not take seriously the notion that filming television shows for the Christmas schedule is akin to, say, performing open heart surgery or tending to the Large Hadron Collider. Yet it appears I am a vital service, so sleep easy, Britain. I set off to Belfast with paperwork permitting me to spend meaningful time with both John Humphrys and Joe Pasquale (yes, really), while still lacking the go-ahead to visit my own father in a care home. In normal times, of a Saturday in Belfast, I’d head to Ox, Coppi or The Muddler’s Club for dinner, taking full advantage of this beautiful, burgeoning city, which, over the past decade, has grown into a prosperous, joyous place with a thriving food scene and a youthful population. Instead, I pocketed two boxes of Graze’s chilli and lime cashews in case my Belfast hotel was legally unable to serve me dinner. On the Saturday I arrived, the Northern Irish hospitality industry was awaiting guidance to see if they could reopen in six days’ time, as had been tentatively planned. As it happened, almost the whole of the following week ticked by with landlords and restaurateurs begging for clarity as to whether they should stock pantries, fill cellars and put staff back on rota, with no word coming until, on Thursday, they were told no. It’s a similar tale wherever I go. At Belfast’s Grand Central Hotel, it turned out that a chef was allowed to be on site, and he made me a wonderful sweet potato curry with rice and a vegan chocolate brownie. It felt like love on a tray. “May I have a glass of red wine, too?” I asked when I placed my order. “No alcohol is being served in the hotel,” I was reminded, very sweetly. “But, but… I am alone, in my room,” I mewled. “What can I possibly get up to?” But rules are rules, and I duly respected them. The following day, like a naughty child, I took matters into my own hands and bought my own supply from a WineFlair, an old-school offie I found down a side street, which had a glorious, tin can, spilled vodka and crisp packets smell. It took me right back to the 1980s, when, being the tallest of my teen friends, I’d be despatched to buy Cinzano Bianco wearing Panstik and high heels. Now here I was, many, many years later, the restaurant critic for the Guardian, buzzing on WineFlair’s bell to be let in to buy what ended up being a warm bottle of Blossom Hill merlot. I grabbed a bag of Frazzles and a double Snickers to add to my emergency suitcase larder, too, because what I’ve learned while travelling about Britain is not to assume there will be food everywhere, and to buy willy-nilly whenever you need it. As I tried to leave WineFlair, I realised the manager had locked the doors while I was perusing. “Stops folk robbin’,” he explained deadpan. Sometimes, as an extremely vital key worker, I just don’t get the respect.','https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/nov/20/grace-dent-key-worker-get-me-out-of-here-restaurants-bars-cafes','Grace Dent','I''m a key worker get me out of here! | Grace Dent on restaurants',-2.45438910000000021,54.2776946999999907,0.4753);

Essex folk doing “Essexy” things – winebars, brunch, nail appointments, wearing leather leggings – is the winning formula for multiple award-winning TV shows. Rarely, however, do we see Essex’s fancier fine-dining side, which is a shame as the county excels at fantastic, old-school, multi-course, finesse-in-heaps hospitality, with places such as Dunmow, Dedham, Chatham Green and Bell Common all being destination dining spots for earnest foodie types. Essex hospitality’s bigger problem, of course, is it’s just too darn close to Soho, where the fine-dining scene transmogrifies weekly, overshadowing the likes of chef Jahdre Hayward, his wife Amanda and his small, friendly team. This is a great shame, because since Haywards opened in 2013, people who love a good lunch have pointed me there, talking of a renovated coach house and skittle alley, close to a 17th century pub, serving ornate plates of venison with parsnip and quince or fig with Pedro Ximénez souffle. During the grimmest days of the pandemic, I wondered if independents like Haywards could remain afloat, so it was pleasing to enter its dining room of a Friday noon and be reminded how many ladies who like a three-course lunch live in the environs of Epping Forest, because it was fizzing with the kind of gossip about errant grandchildren and neighbourhood disputes that makes me want to pull up a chair and say things like: “She didn’t?” and “Not with those ankles”. Stylewise, Haywards felt, and I mean this in the nicest sense, like being on the set of MasterChef: the Professionals – a pale room with strategic pops of tasteful marine blue, a wooden floor, single flowers in rectangular mini-vases, unframed aerial friezes of the countryside on the walls and a grey menu where the modern-European fine dining is revealed with scant clues as to how it may look; eg: “monkfish, leek, mussels”. On telly, this gives Jay Rayner and me the opportunity to explain airily how we expect the dish to look, only to be heroically wrong when our lunch finally bowls in. We opted for three courses from the small, yet meaningful à la carte, kicking off with a very good, fresh-from-the-oven sourdough loaf and a plentiful wodge of salted butter, plus a surprise of veloute of pumpkin and a crisp, aerated cod-skin cracker dotted with delicate taramasalata, perched on rocks. By this stage, I knew Haywards was a great choice. It may not be as throbbingly of-the-moment as the newest multi-million-pound London or Lake District venture, but it has assured, ambitious dishes, using stellar produce, served by warm-hearted ladies whose feet never seem to touch the floor. A starter of glorious cured mackerel arrived, skin glossy, flanked by puddles of mackerel tartare in a clear dashi broth, made pretty with radish. A starter of quail was both roast breast and confit leg with crisp skin, a poached quail egg arranged dreamily around heavenly artichoke puree and deeply moreish pickled mushrooms. Things only got brighter over mains with a beguiling plate of roast lamb rump, crisp belly and croquette of shank, with aubergine puree. Unusually for restaurants like this, Haywards offered a plentiful side dish filled with steamed carrots, baby potatoes and hispi cabbage, lest anyone grumble that they left hungry. Oh how I have quietly pined for a potato at some world-class restaurants. Not here. The hero dish was a roast loin of venison, with a homemade venison sausage surrounded by satellites of quince puree and shooting stars of roast artichoke. A further mini-saucepan of venison ragu appeared to spoon over the buttered baby potatoes and add to the fun. Having eshewed booze and drunk only quince and ginger fizz, I had the perfect right to order a souffle all to myself. Tired of souffle, tired of life, I say. There will never be a time anyone presents me with one of these wobbly, featherlight highlights of pudding architecture and I don’t react like the Queen if you show her a racehorse. “Souffle,” I will gasp, as I did when a cream-coloured fig-flavoured souffle with caramel quivered as it neared my table, bringing along its friend, fresh almond ice-cream. It was five spoons of ecstasy that will rule me out of ever wearing leather leggings – without having to be cut out of them two minutes later in a changing room – but it was absolutely worth it. Haywards wasn’t the coolest, newest or the most experimental place I ate at during that week, but it lives on in my memory as fantastic, and that makes all the difference. • Haywards, 111 Bell Common, Epping, Essex CM16 4DZ, 01992 577350.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(217,'2020-10-09T09:00:25Z','Big Jo, London N7: ''A bit of genius'' | Grace Dent on restaurants','Good news being slim on the ground right now, I greeted rumours of Big Jo’s arrival with a sense of joy. Big Jo may sound a bit like a terrifically handy neighbour with massive hands who you could trust to hammer up a flat-pack shed, but is actually a capacious new pizza parlour that opened up late last month in Hornsey, north London. OK, it’s not just a pizza parlour. It’s a pizza-selling, croissant-flogging all-day bakery with its own flour mill and grain silo, plus your own personal Jesus on every table. Every table – and the loo – is lit ethereally by a kitsch prayer candle featuring Christ’s beatific face. Or at least that tousled surf-version of Christ when he looks like one of the Kings of Leon (other takes on Christ are available). Anyway, whoever thought to smatter Lourdes-style tat tastefully throughout this big old bare space is a genius, because on a cold Saturday October evening, with the rain hammering down outside, the restaurant felt buzzy, vast and cosy all at the same time. Our leaders’ latest Covid-thwarting brainwave – in case you’re lost - is to close all restaurants promptly at 10pm and send packs of not remotely sinister inspectors to peer through letterboxes lest they can hear people masticating after the deadline. It is unclear how forcing everyone on to public transport at roughly the same time, while simultaneously slashing the profits of every hospitality outlet that has survived thus far, is helping us combat the virus, but still, I trust those in charge implicitly. Also, this has all been a positive boon for the taxi service Uber, which now seems to be pushing the x2.6 surge button to coincide with the new kicking-out time. I do wonder if, by around Christmas, anyone will be leaving the house at all, but if anyone can survive this, I’m thinking Big Jo can. It’s a new venture by David Gingell and Jeremie Cometto-Lingenheim, who already run Westerns Laundry in Highbury and Primeur and Jolene in Stoke Newington, and this time they’re serving deep-fried calzone that’s heaving with melted cheese, comes with a blisteringly hot chilli dipping sauce and is literally an extra pant size on a plate. But who cares when we can all wear track pants all week long anyway? Gingell, I reckon, is a bit of a genius. I love Westerns Laundry for its never-ending ability to take simple, wholesome ingredients and make them table-thumpingly orgasmic. He’s done it again here with sardine escabeche: sharp, fresh and joyous. Or a plate of soft, sweet, skin-on baked pumpkin with mild ricotta, crisp sage leaves, hazelnuts and seeds. The menu at Big Jo, as at all this duo’s places, changes daily, but here expect small plates, pizza by the slice and then pudding. On this particular Saturday, we ate large, plump scallops served in their shells and doggy-paddling in the most garlic-laden herb butter that a mortal human could stand. Also among the small plates was a rich, slow-stewed beef cheek with sweet, melting carrots and radicchio leaves. I am aware that none of these dishes truly “goes together”, but then, Gingell is very much a what’s-in-the-fridge-today sort of chef, and it all makes sense after a couple of glasses of Xarel·Lo, anyway. I’m not sure that I’d describe what Big Jo is doing with bread and toppings strictly as pizza, however. Servings are smaller, richer and much more bespoke and luxurious than you’d find at Pizza Express, say. Around £7, for example, will get you a slice of, cough, regeneratively farmed local grain, economy-supporting, sustainable food-system-enhancing sourdough topped with top-notch organic smoked schiena (AKA back fat), new potato and fresh rosemary. This slice will be oily, buttery, herby and satisfying. It is neither a crisp, meagre pizza or a Chicago Town pizza or that Italian pizza that’s swept into trendy London in recent years, where everything sits on the top, unmelted and unloved. Instead, this is a Gingell spin on pizza, where the loveliest things imaginable are chucked at very good bread. The puddings, similarly, are a Gingell take on soft-serve ice-cream, served in small glasses and filled with caramel sauce and almond praline, or warm, utterly un-Italian and decidedly Alsatian apple tart: fresh, delicate, decadent and served with creme fraiche. We left before the night-time inspectors arrived and ticketed us all for wanton nocturnal laughing. I love Big Jo and want it to survive the apocalypse. Winter is coming, and the only thing I know for certain right now is that people will always like pizza. • Big Jo 318–326 Hornsey Road, London N7, 020-3915 6760. Open all week, 8am-10pm (4pm Mon).

If I could do Zédel, I could face the world. It has the largest dining room I know, just off Piccadilly Circus in London, and I’d booked for 1pm on what the media was waggishly calling “Super Saturday”. If anyone could sprinkle an air of jocundity over all this havoc, and keep everyone safe in the meantime, it would be restaurateurs Chris Corbin and Jeremy King. I’ve been a repeat customer here for the past seven years, more recently favouring a quick, pit-stop meal of their pithivier d’épinards au beurre de cerfeuil – let’s not stand on ceremony here: it’s basically just a puff pasty pie stuffed with creamed leaves. I start with celeriac rémoulade and a glass, or perhaps two, of Crémant de Loire. The truth is, however, I never went to Zédel purely for the food. This cavernous basement is part restaurant, part cocktail lounge, part cabaret club. It is faux-French, stopping just short of ’Allo ’Allo territory, seats about 200 and turns all its tables roughly three times every night. If you sit here long enough, Melvyn Bragg will probably walk in, looking curiously ageless and fresh from dissecting the Picts on In Our Time. Normally, Zédel thrived by serving decent-quality, Cafe Rouge-style French classics at Cafe Rouge prices to pre-theatre crowds, tourists, and retail and media workers. You may have noted several clanging chimes of doom during that previous sentence, because, currently, there are no thrice-weekly coach trips from Huddersfield to see Jersey Boys. There are very few tourists at all, while many of Soho’s post-production studios, PR head offices and ad agencies are not just working from home, but pondering whether to come back and face steep rents again at all. I mean, why bother? Isn’t everyone happy on Zoom? And as for Cafe Rouge, last week, its parent company folded. Similar scenes are playing out in every city centre across Britain, with footfall down everywhere. However, I worry especially for Soho, which is, to my mind, merely a handful of theatre and restaurant closures away from becoming first a wasteland, then rebooting as several rows of shadowy, money-rinsing kiosks called things like The Rainbow Egg Bubble Waffle Shop. Here, customers could descend their sterilised coach steps, wearing visors, swooshing themselves with disinfectant, then posing to create Instagram content while eating a waffle next to somewhere Sid Vicious once vomited, before scarpering off towards Bicester Designer Outlet Village. With this in mind, I aim to use Soho, rather than lose it. Things cannot be the same, so one has merely to embrace the different. Zédel, for example, was working with a third fewer tables than usual, and with hand sanitiser gel packets now part of the place settings. A heat-seeking, infrared thermometer at the maître d’s desk revealed I was 36.2C and chimed merrily to say I was cool enough to have lunch there. Earlier, in the cocktail bar at Folie, where we went for apéritifs, the wine list was available only via QR code. Still, after 104 days of staring into my fridge and trying to find interesting new ways with reheated Puy lentils, the act of unfurling a napkin and being offered a bread basket felt magical. Our server began by checking whether we were fine to have our wine served, deftly trying to gauge the boundaries of our fears without himself appearing too casual or too paranoid. These new tricks cannot be remotely easy for staff. Every customer they meet will have an ever-so-slightly different attitude to risk. Few of us wish to eat anywhere that looks, feels or smells like a clinic, but, just as football fans are finding they don’t quite love the game as much without the noise from the terraces, diners will need to learn to love restaurants that are kept purposefully music-free in order to keep chat quiet. Say it, don’t spray it. Or perhaps: the Vengabus is not coming, we do not like to party. In Brasserie Zédel’s case, no music means, for the time being at least, no live jazz in The Crazy Coqs bar. This made for a more sedate visit all round, with no need to stay vigilant during my îles flottantes lest my Observer counterpart Jay Rayner suddenly appeared and began plinky-plonking his way through Fly Me To The Moon on the piano. Every crisis is an opportunity. • Brasserie Zédel 20 Sherwood Street, London W1, 020-7734 4888. Current opening times Mon-Fri 5-9.30pm (last orders), Sat &amp; Sun noon-9.30pm (last orders).

Still, it’s one of the most seductive emotions, which is why, when restaurateurs Noble Rot took on the former site of The Gay Hussar – founded in 1953 – on Greek Street in Soho, they promised to preserve some of this infamous Hungarian restaurant and former political lunching haunt’s former glory. It’s also why my first thought was: “Lord God, why?” The Noble Rot gang, if you’ve ever had the sublime pleasure to visit their original Bloomsbury restaurant, are people who do things correctly, offering inventive, modern European food, a clever, considered wine list and soothing, diligent service – plus a dining room bubbling with the scarlet-nosed food scene cognoscenti. The Gay Hussar, on the other hand, when I last visited in 2013, was barbaric on many levels, from the chilled cherry soup that tasted like Nesquik mixed with Lidl Bull’s Blood and the sludgy bean cholent stew served in a potato-lattice fortress to the sticky carpets, dusty bookshelves, laminated menus, whiff of the fryer and the staff who used to stand in the kitchen peering at you through the chef’s pass like the cast of Meerkat Manor. The best thing Noble Rot could have done for this spot, if they’d asked me, was to fill it with dynamite and stand well back. Thankfully, they did not ask me. Instead, they have lovingly rejigged this old dear into something really quite lovely, and in the process invoked a gorgeous memory of something that didn’t actually exist. Noble Rot II – the sequel – is an elegant, softly lit, old-school dining establishment, all slick brown leather banquettes, flattering bordello lamps and cut-glass decanters, with two inviting dining rooms, a creaky, dark staircase and political cartoonson the wall, in a nod towards its past, along with goulash on the menu. More importantly, however, they’ve also installed the talented Alex Jackson, formerly of Sardine, at the stove. When I say that the new Noble Rot is heavenly, it is not poetic frippery; this is more or less what the big dining room in the sky is for me: an informal yet ostensibly formal, louche lunching spot with posh roast chicken and chocolate mousse. Though, of course, I am underselling both of these things: the whole chicken is for two and is served with a rich, memorable morel and vin jaune sauce and a tureen of soft, fragrant pilaf rice, while the firm yet wobblesome chocolate mousse comes with a brandy prune and a warm hazelnut biscuit. It’s a joy to see Jackson flourishing in this new setting. He takes eggs casino – humble boiled eggs stuffed with an anchovy, butter and cream gloop – and elevates them from Abigail’s Party fodder to something quite wonderful. The Hungarian-style cabbage leaves stuffed with stewed game, meanwhile, would certainly win no beauty competitions, but are rustic and moreish and all the better for it. The vegetarian option was buttery girolles with grilled polenta, creme fraiche and parmesan. This is not a menu for dieters hoping to shift that 10 or so pounds of lockdown “upholstery”; it is more a place to embrace the new you and gain extra cladding for the long winter ahead, with choux buns (let’s just call them profiteroles) stuffed with rich, duck liver paté and decorated with Tokaji jelly, or bowls of clams in a sweet riesling sauce, with a side of freshly baked, buttered bread for mopping. Their baba is sodden with armagnac and served with whipped cream, and the cheese plate featuring Langres, St Nectaire and Selles Sur Couffy is available with its own sticky wine flight of Alsatian and German sweet things. Wines run from quaffable, dependable, pocket-friendly stuff such as the house vinho verde, Chin Chin, at £3 per glass, to labels such as Emidio Pepe, Cecile Tremblay and Lynch-Bages that geeks genuflect towards. Since my lunch, I’ve told several people to stick this place up their sleeve for a time when they’re not scared of London, or of dining out, or of people. Noble Rot Soho is a birthday or special-occasion place, true, but it is also a place for any given Tuesday when you wish to remember that life is worth living. It isn’t harking back to 1953; rather, it is reminding us that there are still reasons to leave the house in the winter of 2020. If anyone can keep the old place ticking over for another 67 years, it’s this gang. Noble Rot Soho, 2 Greek Street, London W1, 020-7183 8190.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(224,'2020-10-23T11:10:12Z','The Grand Hotel, Brighton: ''Afternoon tea is where it''s at''– restaurant review | Grace Dent on restaurants','In the foyer of the Brighton Grand Hotel, I spied details of their afternoon tea, served in their rather pretty Victorian terrace lounge overlooking the prom. Twenty types of loose-leaf teas, they promised, and scones, freshly baked. I peered at the rain outside, I looked at my watch and found myself hovering by the reservations desk. We all need an emotional pick-up right now; especially ones we can have mid-afternoon, to be safely off home before the 10pm Covid fairy looms. Perhaps, these days, afternoon tea is actually where it’s at. The sedate terrace with its bottle-green velvet chairs, offsetting a tropical mural, was peopled by small tables of jolly, chattering over-60s refusing to be kept indoors and a group of five girlfriends arranging helium balloons, waiting for their final, main guest. Life on the terrace felt gloriously adrift from the unfolding news cycle. Yes, all the usual plans are in place, but it was upbeat and normal, almost. Ten minutes prior to sitting down, I’d liaised with a shadowy figure – a mobile medic working for a TV company – in an alleyway, to do nose and throat swabs, in order to tick insurance forms so I could taste-test mince pies with Phillip Schofield days later. Nothing is normal right now. I judge afternoon tea with completely different parameters to dinner or lunch, but rest assured, I am judgmental. In fact, if you seek to find yourself down a conversational cul-de-sac with me, from which your only escape is to feign death, merely ask about my various quests to take my mother for a “nice birthday tea”. Be aware: it is a litany of opaque booking systems, sullen staff, dry scones, leaky teapots, miserly jam and bills for £75. I shall not forgive The Sharrow Bay Hotel in the Lakes snootily stuffing us in a chintzy room littered with dead and dying flies, nor a tearoom on the Lizard peninsula, where service took so long I had to cut my fringe between the sandwiches and sweet treats. Perhaps bad afternoon teas rankle me more than poor dinners or lunches because I need them so badly to be good. Few people pre-book a three-tier cake stand served in a bay window casually. No, the afternoon tea is often for special circumstances. It’s something we book for Gran who doesn’t leave the house a lot, or our very pregnant friend for her last hurrah, or someone with a birthday who isn’t quite up to dinner, but eyes nevertheless light up at the thought of a mid-afternoon sugarfest. Afternoon tea is a curious event – more of a ritual than a meal – full of decadent titbits and pots of extra hot water and perplexing tea strainers. It should feel olde worlde, elegant yet never off-puttingly posh. It should send you off feeling stuffed in an ever-so-slightly nauseous manner, but overall as if you did yourself a favour. The Grand are doing lots of little things right. Service was prompt and chipper. We were not treated – and this happens a lot with afternoon teas – as if this shift was a chore for the staff that the hotel’s financial bods insist on to rake in cash. One server, spotting we’d asked for no pork, quickly checked without prompt on the gelatin content of the cakes. This rarely happens even in Michelin-starred joints. The enormous, nerdy tea selection is a lovely touch, too. The Blue Lady loose tea by the Kent &amp; Sussex Tea &amp; Coffee Company is magical. It’s sort of turbo earl grey with sweet citrus notes. I ordered boxes of the stuff afterwards. The Grand’s full afternoon tea consisted of a tiny, delicate individual goat’s cheese tart the size of a coat button (totally forgettable, serve a slice or don’t bother) and then a plate of nothing-to-write-home-about, crusts-off “finger sandwiches” of poached salmon, egg and, of course, cucumber. Nobody of sane mind has ever longed for a cucumber sandwich, yet between 2pm and 4pm, it is de rigueur. Talking of sanity, I ate the delicious, warm scones with the clotted cream slathered on first, before jam, because cream is most akin to butter, so therefore makes a good base for something sticky. There were two scones per person, but, having noted the Grand’s excellent policy of dishing out pretty takeaway boxes, I saved one for the car home. Cakes verged more on the side of the stonking “get them across your chest” variety – chocolate brownies, white chocolate profiteroles, moist pistachio cake – than those painfully fancy, “designer” limited edition creations one finds in London tea rooms. Gosh, I loathe a gimmicky afternoon tea “collaboration” conjured up by a fashion designer and served without conviction by the bemused staff. The Grand does not do this: the piece de resistance was a whopping slice of glorious world-class orange-infused polenta cake, which I ate in bed when I got home, out of the box – laptop on knees, The Haunting of Hill House on the go, wearing a new pair of pyjama bottoms I bought to celebrate London going into tier 2. I’ll take my joy where I can get it. And my afternoon tea right up until bedtime. • The Grand, 97-99 King’s Road, Brighton, BN1. 01273 224 300. Afternoon tea Mon-Thu 2pm and 4pm, £24.95.

Starters £5-£9, mains £12-£17, desserts £5, wines from £18. From September, The Royal is going to be open from Tuesday-Saturday for dinner and Wednesday-Sunday for lunch Imagine you could DNA test the recently reopened Royal in St Leonards on the East Sussex coast. Perhaps you’d start by taking a sliver off the dark polished bar and mix that with a dollop of their sweet, lubricious pork rillette. Add a few of the borlotti beans off the monkfish dish. Blitz it with some of the mirabelle tart with crème fraîche. Dissolve the sample in a solution, ideally a mixture of crémant and Italian merlot, before spinning it through a centrifuge until the unique gastronomic genome revealed itself. I can tell you exactly what you’d find: that this venture is but the latest branch in a delicious restaurant family tree stretching back almost 30 years. That tree began in 1991 with the Eagle, the early, sanded-down gastropub in London’s Farringdon which I wrote about in the first weeks of lockdown. The Eagle managed to gene-splice itself, through the people who worked for it, with the abattoir chic of Fergus Henderson’s nearby St John. Along the way those two restaurants have trained up people who have gone on to launch the much-loved Anchor &amp; Hope, the Canton Arms, the Magdalen Arms, the recently opened Clarence, the Camberwell Arms, the only recently closed Great Queen Street and a bunch of other places besides. They do not share a menu, though a lot of braised shoulders of lamb have come out of their various kitchens over the years. Instead, what makes them family, other than the fact that the personnel have all worked with each other, is an approach. The dishes they serve are never pretty, but they are damn attractive. They’re built around sturdy, reliable ingredients. Pies may feature. There might be outbreaks of piccalilli or shepherd’s pie, which would suggest a British sensibility. But it’s all filtered through an understanding of the eternal verities of rugged French and Italian country cooking. It’s food that lubricates conversation, rather than trying to be the focus of it. James Hickson, who runs front-of-house here, and chef Sam Coxhead have indeed worked at Green Queen Street, the Canton Arms and St John. They are clearly not attempting to escape their birthright. According to my companion, a Hastings and St Leonards lifer, the Royal was once one of the roughest pubs in town. Not any more. Hickson and Coxhead have stripped the space back to the very best of the wood and painted it in calming shades of pea green inside and what colour charts tell me is called “ocean blue” without. The walls are hung with vintage French aperitif adverts. They make a non-pub-goer like myself feel I’m in a safe space. There’s a blackboard for guest beers. It’s all extremely civilised. Doubtless this will infuriate some locals who liked it when it was the other type of pub. It’s not my culture. I can’t get involved. The menu is short and tightly written. There is a big scoop of soft, melting pork rillettes that could double as a face cream when the Olay has run out. Or you could just rub it straight on to your thighs to deal with the cellulite. It’s going to end up there anyway. The nearest thing to cooking among these starters is a buxom fillet of mackerel, which is what you’d hope to find down here on the coast. Its skin is bubbled and crisped. It perches atop fat, roasted plum tomatoes and a surging landslide of pesto. Behold the beauty of bright red on brilliant green; of sweetness and acidity and spankingly fresh fish. A rainbow of baby beets and leaves comes dressed with yogurt and the Middle Eastern burst of cumin, sesame seeds and za’atar. It’s a plate of food that’s checking on your welfare. There are a couple of non-meat dishes like this among the mains: a tortilla with peppers, tomatoes and olives, or new season coco beans with spinach and artichokes. Servings are generous. Many kitchens look at a duck breast and see two portions. Here, you get what looks like the whole thing, the fat rendered, the skin crisped, the meat blushing. It comes with green beans and an Iranian-influenced sweet-savoury walnut sauce. I could raise an eyebrow at their decision to call monkfish wrapped in crisped pancetta a “saltimbocca”, because raising an eyebrow is part of my skill-set. To qualify for the title there should be a sage leaf and a marsala sauce. When I asked whether all that was present James Hickson described it, wearily, as a “non-traditional” saltimbocca. Honestly, I’d hate dealing with me, too. It’s a very good roasted monkfish wrapped in pancetta and comes with nutty borlotti beans and a sprightly Sicilian lemon salmoriglio sauce. You could probably guess the dessert list: something involving chocolate, a tart, meringues. This is not surprising, but no one comes here to be surprised. They come to be fed. That plum and almond tart is a deep-filled beauty, with a thin case, and a soft, light filling. Sour cream sends it on its way. The meringues are crisp shelled, but gooey within and come with strawberries and cream, because it is the law that they must. There are “feasting” menus available at around £27 a head, ordered in advance, if you can get a larger, Covid-observant group together. They sound extremely encouraging. The pork feast, for example, starts with that great Tuscan soupy stew ribollita, goes through suckling pig shoulder with choucroute and finishes with tarte tatin. Sometimes my job requires me to do peculiar things, like getting on a late-afternoon train from London to the coast just for an early dinner, and then getting back on the train home again. I always discount what us old Jews call the schlepp involved with accessing a restaurant, when reviewing it. But as I sat on that train home, through the fast-falling evening light, I concluded a trip to St Leonards to see the latest addition to this particular extended restaurant family had been a delightful and entirely rational thing to do. News bites We’ve become used to new food take-away services. Norma, the Sicilian-inspired restaurant on London’s Charlotte Street, has gone one better with the launch of Norma at Home.

It will feature both a deli and restaurant and, Khan says, will enable her to continue training a generation of female restaurant owners, managers and chefs through her all-female brigade.

Some of us had never left in the first place. Others, me included, had made an earnest effort, acquiring a semi-regular habit of pulling on newly snug clothes that require buttons before dining in public places, wriggling around the restrictions, and sometimes even clutching a spiral-bound jotter to show that I was definitely “on business”. I ate in deserted restaurants, in church courtyards, in pub car parks and under hastily hammered-up gazebos, and along the way I tried to count some of the tiny blessings of the new world. And there were a few, such as how restaurants had got much more amenable to wrapping up leftovers in classy doggy bags because they needed to clear you out before the inspectors arrived at 10pm. So, although your night out was more or less scuppered before your bum had really warmed the seat, at least you had a cardboard box of pommes dauphinoise ready for breakfast. Waste not, want not. In the new world, you didn’t dine crammed on to a table next to strangers any more, forced to earwig on their chat, rapid table-turning was rarer, and loos were sparklier and more scrubbed than I’ve ever known. But these were just rare Pollyanna moments in an otherwise burning landscape, and now, as of midnight last Wednesday, we’re all confined to barracks again, ordering Aldi booze deliveries, bidding on eBay jigsaws, doom-scrolling on social media and staring into the fridge at least six times a day. At least this further span of lockdown has come at that point in the calendar when I find my pressure cooker riveting. That is not a euphemism. My Sage Fast Slow cooker has an exhilarating steam release that makes knocking up some lentil dal feel as if you’re riding the space shuttle. From the onset of November’s dark nights until around mid-January, merely loading the pressure cooker with legumes, some type of allium and a few cups of stock feels like an actual achievement, whereas from February to March, there is not one recipe (aside from Nigella’s quadruple chocolate loaf served to me by a shirtless Cillian Murphy) that could cheer me up. Which is why, come February 2021, I’m hoping to be able to make another pilgrimage to Fourth and Church, which turned out to be one of the greatest restaurants I’ve been to in the past few years. This is a small, independent labour of love – imaginative small plates, dizzying wine line, fabulous service - that I found out about only after several of its regulars got in touch feeling rather rattled that Sam Pryor and Paul Morgan’s neighbourhood joint was being ignored. “OK, I’ll pop by for a few plates,” I thought, expecting something perfunctory and ending up with egg all over my stupid face because the place is joyous. The menu is a riot of ideas. Confit duck beignets with a puddle of piquillo pepper ketchup from the snacks list, to munch with your first, very good martini. I dream of Pryor’s crunchy fried chicken thighs in breadcrumb with kimchi remoulade, and his trout cured with pastrami-style seasoning and arranged prettily on crisp bread with pickled onion and cream cheese. Fourth and Church is an example of why we will always need restaurants, no matter what, because I love to be at the absolute mercy of such flights of culinary fancy. Warm lamb shoulder croquettes arrive with pickled quince and rosemary-infused aïoli, while mackerel is served on freshly made blue corn tacos with pickled jalapeños and a heavenly marjoram slaw. Charles wittered on for days about his grilled duck heart brochettes, which came with wilted greens festooned in an earthy, pistachio-based slant on dukkah. “These people are kind of maniacs, and I love it,” I remember saying as we decided to ditch the car and order a bottle of wine from the thousands stacked on the heaving shelves behind us. Puddings were a fantastic lemon posset, served in a glass and loaded with chunks of almond streusel, and a pretty much perfect chocolate marquise with cultured cream. We were making plans to come back for a forthcoming birthday before we even asked for the bill, which is the highest compliment you can pay any restaurant, though of course that may well now have to be rethought as the rug is pulled out from under all of hospitality once again. All we can do right now is pencil in 3 December, hope for a miracle and support places such as Fourth and Church by ordering from them online while looking ahead to Christmas. Even if I can’t have that kimchi remoulade, I’ll settle for a box of fine British cheese and a bottle of Ditchling gin. Into the breach again, dear friends.

Starters £11-£14.50; mains £24-£30; desserts £10-£12 and wines from £48 If wealth has any purpose, it is to make things easier, which is to say less effortful. The Garden at the shiny Corinthia hotel on London’s Whitehall Place has this sewn up. There, they have been offering a spendy après-ski experience, only without the tiresome bother of any skiing, what with mountains being in short supply on the Thames Embankment. As a man with weak ankles, no balance and a reasonable concern about the impact of gravity upon what, given my job, I should call my critical mass, this strikes me as a top idea. At the point I visit, London is a few days off being plunged into the sudden darkness of tier 3. While still in tier 2, members of different households are allowed to dine together, but only outside. Some restaurant operators, looking to keep themselves afloat, have grabbed the opportunity. The Corinthia is one of them. No matter that it’s winter. No matter that it’s the coldest evening of the year so far. We have booked. Into the great outdoors we must go. The Garden occupies a deep, curving gash of a courtyard in the middle of the building, strung with evergreen garlands intertwined with fairy lights, twinkling merrily in the darkness. It’s planted with huge patio umbrellas, their edges almost touching. At one end there is a marble fireplace, guttering with fat yellow flames. It’s clearly the prime spot in this brave new alfresco world. Otherwise, warmth comes from towering electric heaters with orange, glowing oval heads that peer down upon you, as if modelled on ET. There’s one to a table. We find ourselves willing the next table to finish up and leave so that we might get their heater, too, like prisoners in a gulag looking to inherit a dead man’s shoes. Albeit a gilded gulag, with patio heaters and mac ’n’ cheese at £25 a pop. We need not fret. The lovely waiters are a study in stoicism and grace in this chiller, and genuinely don’t seem to mind that they’re working here instead of inside Kerridge’s Bar &amp; Grill elsewhere in the same hotel, which has outrageous luxuries, like central heating. They are on hand with blankets and practically tuck us in, like we are patients at an upmarket sanatorium, colonic irrigation optional. For good measure, they give us each a small tumbler of something warm and very boozy. I neck it eagerly. We are brought a brown paper bag bearing the legend “You bake me happy”. It’s a small, warm loaf of chewy sourdough. There is good salty butter with which to slather it. I now know that we will live to see the dawn. The courtyard is full of glossy people looking comfortable in their skins, some of which once belonged to small furry animals. This is a place where the wearing of fur coats is considered entirely reasonable. Being furless, I pull my blanket tighter and peer at the menu. It’s Alpine cooking by way of Mayfair, at Mayfair prices. The Garden is very much all fur coat and many pairs of bespoke silky knickers. They may call it a parsley velouté, but only because calling it soup when it costs £11 might make some people really cross. Like you: it might make you really cross. But not the people who have chosen to be here in this courtyard tonight. The starters provide the one poor dish. It’s a flabby, undercooked rosti, of a sort that should inspire a delegation from the Swiss embassy to troop along to the nearby Foreign Office to register a polite, clipped complaint. The cured salmon and dollops of soured cream and caviar with which it’s topped are better, but also help to dampen what should be lots of crisp potato. Now you understand the depths of my struggle. My caviar is simply ruining my rosti. A warm salad of duck breast, roasted pink and sliced thinly, with sweet, sugar-crusted walnuts, bitter endive and apple is much better. The main courses are belters. They’re designed to help you slip gently into a polite stupor, until rescue comes. Think venison stew with cheese dumplings, or fish pie with cod, trout, boiled eggs, cheese and mustard mash potato. A braised octopus cassoulet with morteau sausage is topped with golden crisped breadcrumbs that seem to shimmer, even in the darkness. Dig in to find a mess of darkly sauced white beans and piggy parts, all of it with a rich seafood umami kick. It’s a dish you scoop away at until you think you’re done. You put down your spoon only to pick it up again and have another go, and another until, oh look, it’s all gone. That £25 macaroni and cheese for two, made with Beaufort and Tomme de Savoie, is clearly intended, from its menu billing, to be the main event. It’s mac ’n’ cheese that’s been to Swiss finishing school. Have it with slow-cooked beef, or mushrooms and truffles or, as I do, with lobster and shellfish. The bronzed, herb-flecked surface is pitted with opened mussels, like black-winged butterflies about to take flight. There’s a light frothy cheese sauce, and boulders of lobster which, despite the heat of the dish, retain their bite. It’s luscious and comforting, rich and luxurious, intense and compelling. It’s what the ruling classes will be eating as western civilisation finally collapses around them. We finish with kaiserschmarrn, a cheery dish of torn, icing-sugar-dusted pancakes with plum compote. Naturally, being the Observer’s man, I order the cheapest wine on the list; naturally, that’s the vinho verde at an “are you serious?” £48. They are serious. There’s not quite enough alcohol in vinho verde to soften the blow. At which point I should acknowledge the obvious: I am not for a moment suggesting you should actually go to the Garden for dinner, should Covid-19 restrictions allow. Heavens no. Sure, most of the food is, of its type, very good indeed. The staff are delightful in the face of a short straw, gallantly pulled. And it’s weirdly fun to eat outside when it’s 4C. But the pricing redefines brutal, which means many of the other diners are of a sort that would make you suddenly forget you knew how to perform the Heimlich manoeuvre, if you saw one of them choking. Then again if you’re feeling robbed of your annual skiing trip, and at least want the après bit, you now know where to go. Or not. Your call. News bites We all need something to look forward to, so mark 12 February in the diary. It’s Chinese new year. To mark it, chef Andrew Wong, of the always brilliant A Wong in London’s Victoria, is putting together a New Year’s feast for home delivery. It will be available through Star Chefs, a new restaurant food delivery platform which has also pledged to contribute a proportion of profits to food education in primary schools. There’s no information yet on the cost of the Wong offering. To find out more, sign up to their newsletter at starchefs.co.uk. The pan-Asian chain Wagamama has launched a new menu for what we’re meant to be calling Veganuary, including meat-free versions of pre-existing dishes. There’s a vegan version of chilli squid using king oyster mushrooms and ‘No Duck Donburi’ utilising shredded seitan and shiitake mushrooms. More eye-catchingly, they have pledged that by the end of 2021 50% of their main menu will be meat free. After the review in this column of their delivery option a few weeks back, Northcote in Lancashire took around 1000 extra orders. Now their sister hotel, the Stafford in London, also home to the Game Bird, is launching a delivery box available to most of the UK. It will change weekly but the first, at £95 for two, included a game sausage roll, lobster vol au vent, maple glazed duck breast with a potato and onion pie and sticky toffee pudding.

Starters £4-£12, mains £10-£34, wines from £26 When Jay Rayner asked me to step in and take care of his beloved column for a week, it felt as if he’d given me the keys to his sports car or entrusted me to breastfeed his firstborn. The jammiest job in the business only requires the answer to one big question: which restaurant brings me joy? Well, I scoured the Michelin Map of Great Britain, deliberating over fine dining and cafés alike. I thrashed out ideas of train journeys to cottage kitchens in the country and posh show-off dining rooms in faraway cities, but ultimately I boiled it down to another question: where do I really want to eat? And there, at the bottom of my street, is the honest answer: the Bull and Last. It’s a pub – according to those who care about pubs. Also, once a week, it’s a shining light for quiz enthusiasts. Most recently, it has opened up six sumptuous rooms to stay in, and even offers picnic baskets for local walkers. But I am heading there with my husband of 20 years (he is not 20, the marriage is), because I love their grub. It’s date night and Jay Rayner is definitely not invited. We are given an early table because they’re like gold dust – and I’m not the first to discover this 300-year-old inn nestling on a busy bus lane on the east side of Hampstead Heath in north London. The east side being the wrong side of Hampstead Heath, according to local author Hunter Davies and the suckers who pay double the price for the same size house only two roads over to the west. The Bull and Last’s appeal lies not just in the oak-panelled open bar and restaurant, but in the staff’s warm and familiar greeting. It’s almost as if they know you. And, let’s face it, that’s the skill of a gold-standard front-of-house. I’d rather presume they’ve seen me on the telly or admired my cooking on Instagram, but the truth is they may well be pretending to remember me. To ask how the family is doing is vague enough to cover themselves and welcome me with a regular’s special treatment. I don’t care either way, as I know that there is a chocolate brownie with my name on it and a second sitting expected in two hours. So with no time to waste, I order a gimlet, to share. My husband looks at me as if he’s about to get lucky. I break it to him that a gimlet is not a sexy piece of Victorian underwear, but a gin and lime cordial aperitif. Homemade lime cordial with a sprig of rosemary turned out to be sexier than undies any day. I’m a cheap date, so at this point I’m already drunk. I also need the Dutch courage, as we decide bravely not to order the same thing we go for every time we come here. You see it’s their buttermilk chicken that I’ve been having a food affair with for a number of years, but we both know it’s time to sow our seeds elsewhere, and I’m trying to eat less meat and no fish. Yes, I’ve seen the same documentaries you have. So when my starter of charred tenderstem broccoli arrives, adorned with roasted pistachio dukkah, bejewelled with pomegranate seeds on a smooth lining of tahini, I vow I will never stray from my new vegetarian mission. Unfortunately, my husband’s fried chilli and black pepper chipirones with aïoli has other ideas. Little crispy baby squid nuggets sent from the Devil, well, from the kitchen that make me certain there should be rules to this new way of life. The first rule being that if I didn’t order it, then it is OK to eat it. Squid in a pub can be the floppiest, chewiest let-down of all, but dear God of calamari… (I can’t use the octopus word because I’ve seen that documentary, too). Here is a kindergarten of seafood so good, I start planning our next visit before our main course has even arrived. All this washed down with a crisp French rosé on the rocks, ranging from a glass at £4.50 to a bottle at £27. My husband is quietly ordering a beer that can only be enjoyed by Bull and Last customers: So Solid Brew, a 4.4% pale ale that is apparently both pale and ale. I glaze over a little at beer chat because I basically only drink rosé, a shared sexy gimlet aside. FYI, this alcohol rule has kept me out of AA due to the lack of a good pink option when I want it, especially during the winter months. Usually at this point on a rare night out à deux, I’d be happy to pack up and get back home to some elasticated clothing and a box set, but the excitement of not picking the buttermilk chicken for the first time keeps us wanting more. Their main courses are known to be a reflection of the stuffed, mounted animal heads watching us dine; they were early pioneers of nose-to-tail, and I’ve definitely eaten a pig’s ear or two here in the past. But changing tastes and a passion for ingredients show up in the middle courses, which range from £15 to £34, offering fish-and-chip classics to pies and steak. I, however, have my eye on one of the two vegetarian options, both with celeriac at the heart of each dish. I lie and say I’m so full I couldn’t possibly fit another morsel in, suggesting I’d need something light. It arrives as a picture of peashoots and zucchini adorning a roasted steak of salt-baked celeriac on a sweet broad-bean relish. Hearty yet delicate, it confirms to me that I was right to think outside my chicken box. It is like eating a garden. My husband, an all together more meaty fella, has a sirloin steak and triple-cooked chips to rival any. Produce and suppliers are key to the success of this place and it elevates each dish that arrives. I’m a confident cook who loves being in my own kitchen, so I need to walk away from a night out knowing I could not have done it better. Well I couldn’t, and that is confirmed with the arrival of the warm chocolate brownie and soft-serve vanilla ice-cream. I mean, what genius allows me to enjoy my childhood favourites at Michelin-starred taste levels? It is unnecessary to order a side ball of Malteser ice-cream but hell, it’s date night and seeing as these good people have returned the Bull and Last to its hostelry roots, as my kids often suggest, maybe we’ll get a room after all.

At Smith’s of Wapping, a fancy fish restaurant close to Tower Bridge, there were many tables doing just that. The original Smith’s was established in 1958, as, apparently, were many of the clientele on this swelteringly hot Saturday, who were all having a merry old time, blowing out birthday candles for a friend or celebrating an anniversary. It’s that type of place: a pristine tablecloths and crisp-shirted staff calling you sir or madam spot; there’s none of that waiters squatting on their haunches and calling you “guys” here, or dishes coming in any order “when they’re ready”. The restaurant world moves quickly, but Smith’s has stayed rooted, serving the same style of pescatarian offerings as its well-loved sister restaurant in Ongar, which, incidentally, is the perfect place for dinner after riding the exhilarating Epping-to-Ongar track, the longest heritage railway in Essex. Yes, I have done this. No, I didn’t realise that travelling 10.2km in a Class 205 Thumper DEMU could be so thrilling, but there you go. Smith’s of Wapping, which opened in 2011, is similarly old-school yet pleasing. It’s proper, slightly posh, but without even a scraping of Michelin-star mimicry such as butter on rocks or bread in hessian sacks. You can, however, have scampi in a china basket. It’s served delicately, of course, and the basket is lined with a mocked-up sheet of newspaper, but still, no wag has attempted to call the scampi Dublin Bay prawns or arrange them into a fragile tower or dress them with a Jackson Pollock-inspired tartare sauce. Similarly, a large, oval plate boasting theatrically large king prawns with a 280g sirloin of prime Scottish beef and a ramekin of garlic butter is called “surf and turf”, which is the sort of parlance to make the modern chef weep into his sous-vide. The same goes for for the menu note that reads, “All steaks are garnished with grilled tomato and field mushroom”. Despite the Hungry Horse, fun pub-style fayre, prices at Smith’s are high enough to make it an occasional splurge type of place: a whole buttered native lobster will set you back £46, while the surf and turf is £50, which makes that one very expensive field mushroom. Still, Smith’s is reliable and really very easy to spend three hours in, especially if Tower Bridge stops working so you have to linger with a glass of chablis premier cru and enjoy the mayhem. They’re also working jolly hard to keep everyone safe, allowing plenty of space between tables. Frankly, Covid-19 has obliterated one of the best things about my job: earwigging. And I regretted not bringing an ear trumpet to Smith’s to enjoy all the post-lockdown catch-up sessions. And although I’ve given up marking restaurants, I am grading complimentary hand sanitiser supplies, and the one at Smith’s I classed as “comfortingly vicious”. My new rule of thumb is, if nothing is hurting, is it really working? We ate yellow fin tuna sashimi with Loch Duart salmon, daikon, soy and wasabi, which was pleasant enough, though it all felt a bit as if the chefs’ hearts weren’t really in it. A main of nicely judged monkfish with langoustine in a subtle, katsu-style sauce with steamed rice was instantly forgettable, while the side of “seasonal vegetables” was diced in a manner that reminded me of the stuff they used to foist on us at school dinner. Charles had octopus in a rather delicious smoked chilli and garlic sauce, but then started telling me about a study in which five California two-spot octopuses were given ecstasy and then wanted to cuddle, which rather took the shine off eating it. Ordering things with a back story is Charles’s way of getting more of the dinner. He learned this during the Galician cow trend, when no meal was complete without a potted biography of Daisy. We finished with a glazed Tiptree strawberry tart with clotted cream ice-cream, which was lovely if not exactly memorable. But the room was heaving with laughing, tipsy sixty-somethings having a nice time and enjoying their freedom. Smith’s doesn’t need to change a thing – it has found its winning formula. • Smith’s of Wapping 22 Wapping High Street, London E1, 020-7488 3456.

Midweek, mid-afternoon, downstairs, alone – much as I have done for the past 25 years. For a while in the mid-noughties, I converted to Leong’s Legend – yes, other Chinese restaurants are available in this square mile – but Wong Kei always stands a revisit. It has existed for so very long, and fed so many, that it is less of a restaurant and more part of the capital’s folklore. Everyone, so it seems, has a story about this gargantuan space on Wardour Street – tales from the 1980s, the 1990s and so on. Sprinkle the name Wong Kei into a chat, and folk seem to whiplash back to simpler times in their personal histories, to when they were single or dating, when Friday nights in Soho always involved some crispy duck served over rice or dry fried beef ho fun in this multi-floored canteen, all served by staff who would abruptly chivvy diners along, and who would bicker among themselves, and sometimes even physically fight. Whether these scraps ever actually occurred, I have no proof, but it all adds to the legend. The staff here certainly put up with no nonsense about requests for a nicer table, or not to sit communally, or for a fork, or trying to pay with anything but hard cash. We used to eat here before going to the Wag club on a Friday, and if you were lucky, you’d see Steve Strange totter past while you were slurping your wun tun soup. Whenever I tell people that Wong Kei is much more affable and sleepy these days, they seem quite disappointed. The fact is the modern day Wong Kei competes with so many other large operations that they’re just not turning tables as quickly as they used to. Along Gerrard Street these days, waiters stand outside restaurants armed with menus, luring in tourists with money-off deals, which I don’t recall happening even 12 months ago. Chinatown is certainly scrabbling to stay upright in a London depleted of tourists. All this makes the atmosphere at Wong Kei all the more dreamy. Plus, the staff nowadays are teenagers in T-shirts who’ll even acquiesce if you ask nicely to sit downstairs and will serve your food on semi-pretty, plastic, branded plates. Pleasingly, that’s where the changes end. Wong Kei did close in 2014 for a grand overhaul, but to my mind this amounted to little more than applying 10 litres of marigold to brighten the downstairs ladies’ loo. Wong Kei will never be lavish or ornate. If you want to spend £57 on a duck, be called madam and feel the three-ply softness of quilted bog roll, please head to Hutong in the Shard. Of an afternoon, Wong Kei is steeped in a peaceable semi-silence of scraping bowls and gossiping grans. I worried that recent times might have put the older generation off eating in Chinatown, but these people are made of stronger stuff. The staff served me a large plate of soft, sticky-skinned aubergine with sliced fish over rice. The fish is wrapped in batter, the aubergine rich and meaty. I’m a huge fan of the deep-fried bean curd, pleasingly bland yet fluffy on the inside, scorched on the outside and carpeted in fierce chilli and minced garlic. The ma po bean curd with beef is also heavily decent, the stewed brisket beef hot pot dependable, while the Hong Kong-style pork chop seems as popular now as it was in the 1990s. And Wong Kei’s menu remains a broad church: deep-fried intestine, bitter melon and stewed ducks’ webs sits close to lemon chicken and Singapore noodles. Service is always super-rapid and dishes always turn up far too hot to start eating straight away. And that’s a line I’ve not written about any restaurant in more than 20 years. On the day I returned to Wong Kei, after six months away, there were reports that the ravens at the Tower of London had begun to stray because of boredom, which was a jolly news snippet, but also a portent for societal meltdown, with Tower Bridge crumbling next before the monarchy topples. On the ground floor of Wong Kei, I took a pew and poured tea, ordered bean curd, some aubergine and extra dry noodle in oyster sauce, plus some takeaway cold roast duck and soya chicken on rice for Charles for when he got home from work, as well as a chow ho fun mixed seafood. “Can I keep hold of the menu?” I asked the waitress, who immediately went to take it off me. “No, you can’t – you’ll get it dirty,” she said, snapping it away in a delicious burst of semi-rudeness. That made my day. The world might be sliding to hell in a handcart, but my beloved Wong Kei is alive and kicking. • Wong Kei 41-43 Wardour Street, London W1, 020 7437 8408.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(243,'2020-11-08T06:00:32Z','The Elder, Bath: ‘A brilliant beam of sunshine’ – restaurant review','Editor’s note: this review took place before the current lockdown was imposed The Elder at the Indigo Hotel, 2-8 South Parade, Bath BA2 4AB (01225 530 616). Three dinner courses £45, three lunch courses £35, two dinner courses £37.50, two lunch courses £27.50, wines from £25 Recently, in a restaurant in Bath, I got indecently excited about a soufflé. To be fair, at The Elder I got excited about a lot. God, it felt good, experiencing this raging bubble of happiness rise up inside me. And all because of what a clever man called Darrell had done with whipped egg whites and sugar, damsons and stupid amounts of perseverance. I forgot that the waiters were wearing masks, and that the tables were set wide apart, and that the government is run by a bunch of sweaty-cheeked walking prolapses who are making it up as they go along. That’s what great cooking does. It makes the world seem better, even if only for as long as it takes to scrape the ramekin clean. No, you can’t make this at home for a quarter of the price. To try it you have to come here to The Elder, the restaurant of the newly opened Indigo Hotel. Even that last line is thrilling. Right now, everything is closure and “God help us.” Depressingly, it’s all justifiable closure and “God help us.” There’s very little in the way of a bright side upon which we may look. And yet here’s Mike Robinson, the chef renowned for his game cookery; for dishes involving words like haunch and faggot and shin, opening a new restaurant into the gnashing teeth of a pandemic. It’s surely madness. If so, it’s welcome madness, a giddy expression of optimism. Apparently, they’d spent five years working on the project, and finally it was ready. They decided to unlock the doors anyway. The result, located within a terrace of those Georgian honeyed townhouses that Bath has in shameless number, is a beauty: a series of linked rooms, their panelled walls painted a deep-sea green and hung with hunting prints. There are globe lights and dark wood floors and banquettes of leather the colour of the best butterscotch. Down the hall on the great trek to the loos are murals of pretty woodland creatures of the sort the menu will soon invite you to eat. This is a feature of game restaurants. They enjoy sentimentalising their ingredients. Still, few chefs know as much about the business of well-managed, sustainable hunting as Robinson. He made his name at the Pot Kiln in Berkshire before opening the Woodsman (also inside an Indigo Hotel) in Stratford-upon-Avon. He co-owns the Harwood Arms in Fulham, which turned the venison scotch egg into a luxurious culinary fetish item. Along with his executive chef here, Gavin Edney, he plays to the gallery, as long as that gallery is full of game lovers. For the record there’s also an evolved vegan and vegetarian menu. Think coffee-roasted carrots with dukkah and salt-baked celeriac with onion juices. But I can’t lie. I’ve not come to The Elder for coffee-roasted carrots, however lovely they might be. Dinner starts with a grandiose nod to huntsman culture: their version of bullshot tea. It’s a glass of lip-smacking venison stock enriched with sherry, served hot and, on the side, a crisp-crusted mini-loaf of still-warm granary bread and salted butter. I have no interest in shooting woodland creatures. It’s not part of my skill-set. I can play a mean version of Cole Porter’s Love for Sale at the piano. Killing my dinner? Not so much. But if it always began like this, with a grown-up’s version of Bovril, I’d be there, if only to wave off the hunt. Among the starters is a warm crab tart, which has me blinking and grinning and hunting around for useful comparisons. Let’s try this. It’s the Judi Dench of crab tarts: classy, technically brilliant, compelling but also moving and hugely satisfying. The next-door table of four all order this. Normally I’d judge them for so doing, because I’m horrid. Couldn’t they have mixed it up a bit so they got to try a few different things? With this piece of culinary magic, I don’t blame them at all. There’s a crisp, golden pastry shell, secured on the plate by a disc of lemon mayonnaise. There’s a layer of white crab meat and a layer of the brown meat for punch and, on top of that, a brassic, hot and sour chimichurri, like a neatly mown lawn. It’s that rare thing: immense precision in the interests of appetite. All of those qualities are also there in a tartare of sea bream with tiny cubes of apple and oily smoked eel, under a puffed rice cracker flavoured with squid ink and dotted with whipped cod’s roe. There’s a lot going on with the mains. too: a partridge breast partners a ball of stuffed savoy cabbage and a sweetcorn tart with black pudding; deep pink venison comes with red cabbage purée and beetroot, and so on. Both have intense sauces. Bravo. But I’m distracted by a side dish of what they call “dirty mash”. It’s a pot of Joël Robuchon-style pommes purée, as much butter as potato, flooded with a copious amount of a reduced venison jus bobbing with shards and tangles of meat. I don’t much hold with giving food moral labels like clean or dirty. People have morals. Food doesn’t. But if they regard this as dirty, please never let me be clean again. And then the desserts. There’s an exquisitely made lime meringue pie, again with the requisite crisp pastry, the zingy lime filling and so on. But it’s that beautifully risen damson soufflé that fair takes my breath away. For baked into its surface is a perfect, sugar-dusted shortbread biscuit. Pastry chefs live in fear of their soufflés not rising. And yet this one has put a bloody biscuit on the top, which can surely only weigh it down. I ask our waiter how it’s done. Darrell Rolle-Jackson, the brilliant pastry chef, comes out to explain. It took years to perfect, he says. It’s about getting the biscuit as thin as possible and then freezing it. Don’t bother trying this at home. You’ll fail. In last week’s review of Townsend, I talked about the joys of undistracting food. Here at The Elder it’s all about the joy of engrossing food; of cooking that demands you look down; of a kitchen under Edney which knows exactly what it’s doing. They charge £45 for three courses (£35 at lunch) and you can see exactly where that money is going. The opening of a new restaurant in the current circumstances is reassuring enough. The fact that it’s such a good one is a brilliant beam of sunshine breaking through a bruising, cloud-deadened sky. News bites As the new lockdown kicks in, we return to delivery options. First up, a reminder that the subject of last week’s review, Townsend at the Whitechapel Gallery, has been running a nationwide delivery service throughout. It includes not only their own dishes, in a set of varied recipe boxes, but also a lot of basic products through the quality supplier Natoora (townsendrestaurant.co.uk). In a similar vein, the terrific Spanish produce company Brindisa, which supplies both its own restaurants and many others with top Iberian produce, has a nationwide delivery service. They also run various promotions; recently it’s been cheese week (brindisa.com). And finally, chef Adam Handling’s Hame service – the Scottish word for home – lists some seriously high-end delivery boxes starting at £130 for two for Sunday lunch and topping out at £305 for two for the “Who Are You Trying To Impress?” box. Good question. It includes wagyu and caviar tartare, beef wellington and a tarte tatin. As ever I am only the messenger, so don’t shoot me (adamhandling.co.uk).

No ETA on stocks, either. Cumbria is prepping. I ponder the merits of tinned mushy peas instead – always a touch tasteless – then wonder if I can placate with fig rolls. My mother, in her 80s, is being guarded like a rare Fabergé egg, albeit a furious egg that finds this enforcement ridiculous. House arrest is a very strong term, but I am not above a rugby tackle. “No marrowfat peas in west Cumbria?” she gasps down the phone. Now this is a dire situation. This week’s column was meant to be about a jocund lunch at The Dorchester Grill in Mayfair. Oh, wasn’t the lobster thermidor tart delicious? Boy, life came at me fast. It came for millions and millions of people, now bombarding supermarket online sites and hoping, praying, for a delivery slot. Each time I try to amend the order, the website falls over, punch-drunk and exhausted. For a few terrifying minutes, it flounders. Then it stands up again and refreshes, suggesting frozen petits pois and mint Viscounts as alternatives. Seven hundred people died in Italy today, another window on my laptop says. A whole generation is fading. “Don’t worry, they were probably all auld bodies,” mother says. “It’s done a lot of us buggers a favour.” I check out her order quickly, adding some Cornettos, which we used to eat together in the 1970s when the ice-cream van came before Corrie. My order being accepted is a tiny glint of positivity in what has been a very odd day. Millions will be in my position right now, choosing groceries for the isolated. It’s a delicate process. What we eat at home, behind closed doors, is personal. Our secret snacky peccadilloes do not bear scrutiny. When I was young enough to work at the Guardian Guide, we once covered our go-to TV dinners; my love of cheap tinned soup with marge-slathered Ryvita and mini pickled onions was shameful to admit. Similarly, it takes days of gentle questioning to reveal the things the isolated actually want, once they’ve got over refusing help or being grateful. “A jar of beetroot, sliced, not whole,” she says eventually. “Some microwave meals for the freezer, but none with fish. Heinz chicken noodle soup, but not cream of chicken.” “No fish,” I write on my whiteboard, where, via columns of to-do lists, I aim to ride out this planetary blip. I began gathering three weeks ago, in tiny stages, surreptitiously, ashamed of being seen as dramatic. Some chickpeas here, some rice pudding there. I bought these as they quarantined Lombardy. By the time they closed Spain, I was shredding and freezing spring greens and putting individual anchovies in ice-cube trays, which felt incredibly proactive but was, I know now, merely displacement activity. “I’ve never really liked fish,” my mother tells me on one of our now twice-daily phone calls. “But I do like sardines in tomato sauce.” This is totally new information. What else do I not know about her? When the madness passes, which it will, because all things do, I hope we remember how the supermarket staff really served us. It’s ironic how many of us slagged off these places for decades, told the masses to avoid them. Let’s all eat risottos of foraged acorns made with small-batch artisan butter from our bi-weekly farmers’ market! And then this happened, and the Aldi car park is full of Audis jam-packed with Super Noodles. It’s almost as if River Cottage never happened. I hope we remember the selfless hard work of the till workers and midnight shelf-stackers, the people on self-service checkouts who sort our unexplained item in the baggage area problems without maintaining a safe distance. Forever touching the screens we’ve just touched, keeping the queues moving and, by default, breathing in our germs. As shoppers ransacked the pasta and fought over UHT, they had no time to plan for their own families or to watch rolling news or to think too hard if their sweat was the mark of hard work or a fever. I would hug, if I could, the team at my Sainsbury’s Local, who open at dawn every day, always jolly, with the shelves restocked with small amounts of almost all vital items. I’m especially indebted to the drivers whom I’m trusting to get to my mother. They’re taking up the slack on what is now my biggest life problem. I’m trusting total strangers to feed her, not upset her, not frighten her, to keep their distance and to leave the boxes somewhere handy. And to explain to her why there are no rich teas. I wouldn’t call that job unskilled at all.','https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/mar/27/grace-dent-my-mother-in-her-80s-is-being-guarded-like-a-rare-faberge-egg','Grace Dent','Grace Dent',-2.45438910000000021,54.2776946999999907,0.648599999999999954);

The pair grew up in Ilford, and talked constantly about food, trying to figure out how you distil a cuisine eaten by 200 million people, yet in the UK understood by relatively few, into a delicious, life-changing crash course in moi moi, suya and sinasir. Bringing a dream to life with your sibling, I imagine, must be extra-specially magical, because the creativity doesn’t come from stiff breakout meetings or formal planning sessions; it is, rather, honed over several thousand conversations, in-jokes and dinner-table rants. Chuku’s in Tottenham, north London, has about it the sense of a blue-sky dream turned into bricks and mortar. From the moment you step in off the street into the vivid, modern, coral-pink interior – a nod towards adobe clay – to find Emeka being charming as heck at the door, Davido and Dice Ailes on the stereo at a triumphantly loud volume, and mango coladas and zobo sangria on the cocktail list, you’re no longer on Tottenham High Road but in a tiny slice of sleek, contemporary Lagos that serves a taste of Ibadan, Kaduna and Kano in a manner that will make newcomers to moi moi (a savoury, steamed bean pudding) wonder why they left it so long. At Chuku’s, the moi moi comes in small, inconspicuous squares that, at first mouthful, are comfortingly bland, but then, like all the best carbohydrates, reveal themselves to be compelling. Those moi moi sit on the vegan side of the tapas list, alongside five other dishes that lose nothing at all by being animal-free; in fact, to my mind, you could treat Chuku’s as a vegan restaurant and not limit the experience. Fried plantain dodo is soft, crisp-skinned and tossed in cinnamon, sugar and coconut, while the rich adalu – honey beans and sweetcorn slow-stewed in fresh red pepper and tomato – is the perfect foil to a bowl of cassava fries topped with ata dindin, a gloriously fiery, hot pepper dressing. The recipe for ata dindin varies by chef; some are hotter or sweeter or more thyme-based or curry-scented, but here it is vividly red with scotch bonnets. Since I went to Chuku’s, I’ve thought many times about their chicken ata din din – the bird shredded in an even spicier version of that sauce – which I could not finish because the capsaicin levels were quietly, determinedly assassinating me, but which was also far too delicious to stop picking at, because I knew that once the plate disappeared, I would not taste its like from any local takeaway. The folly of any chilli fan is that we never quite know when to quit. For lovers of more mellow propositions, the folk at Chuku’s take plump king prawns and pan-fry them in a sweet, honey-based sauce, and they gloss chicken wings in a caramel and crushed peanut kuli-kuli-style marinade. I went with two friends on a Saturday lunchtime, and we ordered everything. The lot. All of it. There is no better way to deal with Chuku’s – just sit back and let them feed you. Begin at the top of the list with the fresh, crunchy okra in a sharp, sweet, honey vinaigrette, nibble your way through fat, crisp ojojo (yam and mackerel croquettes), and definitely order the beef ayamase, which isn’t remotely pretty, because it’s just stewed beef in dark, fermented locust beans, but which packs a warm, enveloping punch. This is certainly a modern spin on Nigerian tastes and traditions, and there will no doubt be some customers looking for a taste of home comfort who will find Chuku’s loud, tangential and puzzling. They’ll wonder why the egusi bowl with yam dumplings is presented so prettily, or why there is chin chin cheesecake on the pudding section when Nigeria is not especially famed for cheesecake, or even for puddings at all. But if the Fredericks’ mission was to celebrate, trail-blaze and speak loudly the truths of what modern Nigerian-British food looks like in 2020, they’ve certainly achieved that. “You did it! You finished the whole menu!” Emeka said with genuine joy as he collected a dozen empty bowls. “Could you do us a favour?” he added quietly when he brought us the bill. “If you, y’know, liked it, could you maybe tell someone? Maybe on Google?” By this point, there was a queue of hopefuls snaking out of the door. They had been re-opened only a few weeks, but were already on a roll. Chuku’s motto is “Chop, Chat, Chill”, and I honestly can’t think of anything I’d rather do after the last six months of distinctly unchilled existence. “Sure, I’ll tell people,” I promised as I finished off a yam brownie and waddled out into Tottenham. “Maybe not on Google, but somewhere …” • Chuku’s 274 High Road, London N15 (no phone).

Or at least I ended up there, after fitting three restaurants into the first 48 hours post-lockdown. Frosty walks through an underpopulated city, spotting “open” signs and freshly chalked menus, have been joyful, as has the warmth of semi-bustling dining rooms to thaw out my cold posterior. I had very much missed the familiar famished totter from the maître d’s desk to the table, followed by those fantastic first 10 minutes of fondling the menu, surveying the clientele, choosing an aperitif and settling in for some scattergun gossip with a friend. And all this before food even comes into the equation: what the last year has underlined to me is that, often, the cooking isn’t half as important as the togetherness. That said, at Cafe Deco, a brand new, European-style casual restaurant, I suspected the food would err on the side of remarkable. That’s because the place has one of those restaurant-world pedigrees that makes food scene folk go all dewy-eyed. This is a project co-parented by the owners of 40 Maltby Street. If you’ve never heard of this small wine bar and restaurant (and, recently, wine shop, sandwich-maker and vegetable stall, too) that operates out of a railway arch in Borough, it is because food obsessives don’t want you to know. They’d rather you stayed over in touristy Borough Market, instead of taking their spot at the counter of this relentlessly brilliant place with a kitchen the size of a child’s cupboard. A seat for lunch on a Saturday here makes you feel like one of life’s winners. Cafe Deco’s other “parent” is the much-lauded chef Anna Tobias, formerly of Rochelle Canteen in Shoreditch, where you’ll often find me in the courtyard in summer of a mid-afternoon, having popped in for breakfast of sourdough toast with jam and tea, before becoming wildly derailed by the clientele, a bottle of Le Clos Domaine Boudau and a plate of brill with leeks and bottarga butter sauce. Both Maltby Street and Rochelle Canteen are that specific sort of London fancy-relaxed – frelaxed? – which means there’s no need to wear shoes with heels or a tie that makes you feel like a bank manager, but they’re still very much an event. Cafe Deco is also the epitome of this airy-fairy elegance. It is a small, pale room with minimal decor save for the appliance of a large bucket of Farrow &amp; Ball Skimmed Milk and a blackboard menu that the server will carry over and balance by your feet while you choose. This list is not remotely challenging to the casual diner, but the standard of ingredients and preparation elevates it. Egg mayonnaise sounds like nothing much, except here it is a fresh, sunset-yolked boiled egg with earth-shatteringly good homemade mayonnaise topped with a fabulous anchovy. The smoked salmon blini is a large, fresh, warm, yeasty Russian pancake generously laden with fine-quality fish, a hefty dollop of creme fraiche and a pretty scattering of chives. Blinis are so often something and nothing; this mega-whopper-blini, however, heavy with topping, was what I’ve been searching for all my life. Next, a plate of marinated fresh artichokes are titivated, stripped and shaped to a painstaking level that I imagine took at least half a day, and served in an ocean of excellent olive oil. This is clever, finely judged, nicely eccentric cooking with a strong undercurrent of country-house living. There was a very decent beef bourguignon on a bed of thick, buttery mashed potato, and a slab of architecturally beguiling root vegetable pie that took the likes of celeriac and swede, sliced them finely, steeped them in butter and stock, then stuffed them into pastry with handfuls of Lancashire cheese and baked them, to serve warm with a cold dressed salad. Cafe Deco will certainly leave some people puzzled. For one thing, it feels much more like a cafe than a restaurant, with chairs that don’t lend themselves well to sitting in much longer than an hour. In fact, at first glance, it looks a bit like a sandwich shop with lofty aspirations. Still, I’m more than happy to be able to add it to my little black book of places that serve interesting, exceptional food. The warm treacle pudding arrived theatrically in excellent custard that almost overfilled the bowl. Merely the memory of this wonderful, sturdy pudding makes me feel giddy. I made short work of it with some rather powerful muscat eau de vie – vicious stuff, served in tiny, egg-cup-sized vintage glasses – that made me temporarily lose the power to see straight. If they lock us all up again in January, at least I’ll have some good memories. • Cafe Deco 43 Store Street, London WC1, 020-8091 2108. Open lunch Weds-Sat, dinner Tues-Sat.

And yes, I know the last thing residents of bucolic, semi-anonymous villages need is some gob at the Guardian blowing the whistle about their freshly painted gastropub: when I wrote about the Fordwich Arms in east Kent a couple of years back, one local channelled an Orwellian two-minute hate session directly on to Basildon Bond paper. Most enlivened, he was. Regardless, I must tell you about The Curlew, a restaurant by Will and Matt Devlin, the same brothers who opened The Small Holding in Cranbrook on the Kent-Sussex border last summer, which I reviewed at the time. The Devlins seem to have honed the formula for painting big, barn-like pubs in tasteful, taupe shades, festooning them with flowers from their farm, then offering the locals lovely things without a jot of pretension. They deserve a bit of smoke blown up their trouser legs for everything they and their excellent staff have achieved in the past 12 months, too. It’s not easy to do clever, complex, locally sourced dining in rural places without coming across as overly earnest and saintly. Many fail, because they turn the whole thing into a bit of a slog. Not that it isn’t adorable to be given a rolling lecture on arable crop rotation and beehive maintenance over 17 courses, but sometimes I just wish to eat. The Curlew, on the other hand, has 10 different locally made gins on its spirits menu, to have in your aperitif with warm, freshly baked tarragon focaccia with sweet apple balsamic. They act as if these little things are no big deal, but they really are, as is their selection of English sparkling wines, of which I’m a big fan; Dermot Sugrue 2014 is now my brand new favourite. On a very warm, midweek August evening, with only a handful of customers in and joys such as smoked mackerel and bronze fennel paté, and crispy duck farm salad on the menu, my two hours at The Curlew was almost as lovely as this job gets. Good, diligent, passionate yet unobtrusive service. Tables spaced so gloriously far apart, I felt a bit like I’d bought the pub. A little, sedate birthday dinner for an older matriarch in the far corner involved a surprise brownie and lots of family stories and laughing. For a short while, everything felt quite sane in the world, which is precisely the point of hospitality. While The Small Holding has a set menu, The Curlew’s is a single-sheet, ever-shifting, à la carte affair divided into plain-speaking groups: snacks, meat, fish, vegetables and “whole”. When they say “whole Creedy Carver duck”, they really do mean it, gizzard fans: you get everything but the quack laid out on a slate. Despite Charles’ protests, I steered us instead towards the monkfish tail, which came with a heavenly jug of curried butter sauce. We ate this with a delicious, earthy bowl of spelt steamed in stock with fresh broad beans and peas and a side of baked squash. The cooking is precise, balanced and generous; if The Curlew has a signature dish, it’s the miso roasted cod, which tastes of blissful umami caramel and comes topped with samphire and the rather ominously named leaf salty fingers. Pudding was a warm cherry bakewell-style tart with clotted cream. The cheese selection, if you’re a fan, is possibly the most highfalutin offering being served in Great Britain today, though I am willing to be advised otherwise. That evening, it included Golden Cross goat’s cheese, Lord London, Winterdale Shaw, Mayfield, Burwash Rose and Sussex Blue, and it came with some warm, just-baked buttery digestive biscuits, crackers, a tiny loaf of fresh bread, quince preserve, pickled walnuts, leaves, truffled honey and some homemade chutney. After all that, you’ll need a lie-down, and we stayed at Meadow Cottage just down the road, which changed my mind about B&amp;Bs: it offers spotless, modern, white rooms, gorgeous gardens and they’ll make you chipotle beans on toast for breakfast. I know we have our moments, but Britain is really rather brilliant. • The Curlew Junction Road, Bodiam, East Sussex, 01580 860531. Open lunch Thurs-Sun, noon-2.30pm, dinner Thurs-Sat, 6-8.30pm.

In a godforsaken world, this feels like good news – or at least it does to me, because I consider the French all-day brasserie to be one of the high points of modern civilisation. It doesn’t live by earthly time constraints or dress codes; you can pitch up whenever, looking elegant or dishevelled. You can order a pichet of burgundy at 11am and the staff will treat you as if you’re Brigitte Bardot in 1973, taking a breather from feeding donkeys at La Madrague. The menu is generally vast, often flappy, laminated and will contain celeriac remoulade, four types of fatty spud and a decent paris-brest. I wish they’d made more of brasseries in the Tricolore 1 textbook, rather than its arduous passages on babyfoot table football and son et lumière. Opening any sort of restaurant in central London right now is like willingly putting your head into a lion’s cage and hoping it might merely rearrange your fringe. Maison François has more of a fighting chance than most: Matthew Ryle, an ex-MasterChef 2018 finalist, is chef, having trained at the Dorchester and then worked at Isabel; the founder is the affable François O’Neill, formerly of Brompton Bar &amp; Grill; and the rather brilliant Ed Wyand, ex of Scott’s and then Clapton’s Verden, is front of house. In fact, there are traces of all these aforementioned restaurants at Maison François. Service throughout is well-drilled and observant, the wine list sweeps you around 250 vineyards, and the basement bar, Frank’s, is so low-key deluxe, I’ve been in two minds about telling anyone that I’ve got it pencilled in as a place to go full Antoinette and sit out the current woes with a glass of white burgundy, a plate of 32-month-aged comté, some radishes and a bowl of cervelle de canut. Or perhaps I’ll just lurk in one of the corners of the restaurant, where the staff will determinedly sabotage your plans for washboard abs with their multi-drawered pudding trolley featuring shelves full of chocolate eclairs, tarte tatin, canelés and macarons. This is a trick that could spark joy in the saddest heart. I mean, come on: they trundle a sort of ever-giving box of sweet treats to you, brimming with fresh madeleines, rum baba and frangipane tart, all baked in-house. It is impossible not to grin foolishly. This, after all, is a restaurant’s chief role right now: offering brief, intense, shallow, but thoroughly welcome moments of minor magic. I’d swap six and a half days staring at news reports for the good three minutes when Maison François rolled that trolley up to me and my friend Courtney, and we threw back our heads and laughed. So, long story short: Maison François is a good shout if you’re braving the West End. The food is generously, memorably seasoned, and oil-, butter- or garlic-drenched. A humble flatbread, sitting inconspicuously at the top of the menu, arrives laden with melted taleggio, wilted spinach and soft potato. I have similar warm memories of a plate of soft cabbage, sweet with an anchoïade sauce and encrusted with breadcrumbs and chilli. A thick, porky, homespun slice of paté en croute maison arrived with crisp cornichons in their own wooden pot. There were two types of pasta: a wildly decadent, sunset-yellow ravioli du dauphin stuffed with comte, and fresh strozzapreti matched half and half with a ragout of Toulouse sausage and chanterelles. The menu also boasts entrecôte de boeuf, poulet rôti and côte de porc with sauce moutarde, and even john dory with pig’s trotter, but we nibbled instead around the vegetable end of the list. Soft leek vinaigrette came with a neat jacket of bottarga and croutons, lest anyone tries to skip on calories, plus a portion of dark, glossy, multi-layered, architecturally impressive pommes boulangère. It would be possible to eat here many, many times and never order the same thing twice. You might stick to small plates with friends, or do a sturdy, old-school three courses. Yes, Maison François has the definite backbone of classic French cuisine, in the course of a few dishes whisking you around Alsace, off to Lyon and then along to Paris, but there is also a modern, future-facing feel with the likes of red mullet with fennel perched on a punchy, bouillabaisse-style sauce and Instagram-friendly ouef en gelée. You can eat these while Earth Wind &amp; Fire and Bobby Caldwell play on the stereo, which contrives to semi-convince you that, although life is really rather rubbish right now, there is a cream-coloured corner banquette in St James – quite near Fortnum &amp; Mason, so you can have a shufti through the stationery department beforehand – that is still actually, if you relax for just a moment, really quite wonderful. • Maison François 34 Duke Street, London SW1, 020-3988 5777.

Some people will be upset you’ve even suggested it; others might expect you to provide it. But joy is exactly the emotion I crave right now. When I saw my friend Hugh marching through Joy last weekend, I was overcome with giddiness. It was six months since I’d last seen him. Now, here he was, strutting past a large table of organic farm produce from The Goods Shed in Kent for sale in the entrance, all set out like a 1980s methodist primary school harvest festival. Or at least how a harvest festival table was supposed to look: at my school, there would have been much more tinned rice pudding. “At last,” Hugh said, then we picked up our menus and began gossiping, picking up from where we were pre-Covid. Joy is a different thing from happiness, and is much less oppressive in its demands. Joy is a momentary burst of feel-good – a menu, a glass of wine, friendship – that reminds us life is worth living. The fact that Joy sells fresh vegetables, as well as offering a chance to order organic meat, is highly symbolic of hospitality land right now. This is the year for ripping up rulebooks and flying by the seat of your pants. Anything goes, so long as it means you can afford to keep the lights on, and we’re going to see more and more of it as time goes on. This new venture by Stevie Parle and Tom Dixon feels more like a hub, making all the use it can of a gargantuan space on Portobello Dock in Ladbroke Grove, west London. Joy is home to a take-home bottle shop by Uncharted Wines and Biercraft, plus a honey store selling the backlog of fresh London and Kent produce not used by Parle’s other locked-down restaurants. On the weekend I visited, thousands of dahlias, rescued from the compost heap after Hampton Court flower show was cancelled, had been sculpted into a temporary, bee-friendly garden. Flora – the name of the actual restaurant within this mayhem – sometimes lives outside on the cobbles, alfresco, while at other times it’s dragged indoors to avoid downpours, or to stop the wind taking your hyper-seasonal plate of spray-free crudités with cod’s roe and blowing it into the canal. It’s worth reminding people that all British restaurants that have managed to stay afloat this summer by using terraces, gardens and rooftops are now being hit with autumn temperatures, downpours and a whole new set of challenges. That cod’s roe is feisty stuff, by the way, with vegetables served Bugs Bunny-style, whole and raw. The menu changes rapidly, according to what is fresh, and on the evening we dined, there was a watermelon salad with crumbled feta, mint and a bombardment of chilli, a classic Tuscan tomato-and-bread soup and a large bowl of fresh clams with guanciale (cured pork cheek) all steamed with fino and butter. Flora offers imaginative, assertive Mediterranean cooking to be shared or gobbled up separately – fans of one of Parle’s previous restaurants, Sardine, which announced its permanent closure over lockdown, will not be disappointed. Plentiful slabs of moist Loughton Farm chicken breast, stuffed with ricotta and cooked over wood, came on juice-soaked sourdough toast. A plate of rare wood-grilled beef came courtesy of the award-winning Duncan Anderson’s Hole Street Farm in Kingsdown, Kent. “Lockdown lobster” with lardo and rosemary butter arrived with a story about an industrious lobster fisherman who, as the restaurant world shut up shop, began selling his wares via Twitter. Vegans and vegetarians will do well here: grilled courgette with green wheat, roast tomato and tahini was marvellous, and you really must order the fresh, earthy borlotti beans; there are also vegan “meat” balls with judicious inverted commas, plus a lush, Kentish tomato salad with basil, and glorious new potatoes served with smoked butter. Pudding was a bowl of strawberries with cream and meringue. “I couldn’t call it Eton mess,” Parle explained. “Not now. It just didn’t seem right.” The chocolate cake is a dark, rich slab of twice-cooked deliciousness served with fresh raspberries and creme fraiche. They tend always to have a fruit pie on the go, too, sometimes cherry, sometimes peach, but always locally grown fruit, served warm with cream. Actual happiness is slim on the ground out there right now, but there is joy in Portobello. • Flora at Joy Portobello Dock, 344 Ladbroke Grove, London W10. Open Weds-Sun, noon-late (4pm Sun).

Or at least that was how Ian Astbury screamed the word in full Bradford-via-Los Angeles hair-metal mode, which, being a fan of boldly incongruent things, I loved. Which brings me right back to Wildflower, where chef Adrian Martin has taken a shipping container in Camden and turned it into a prim, slightly chintzy space with tablecloths, teal velour chairs and otter-grey shagpile that serves a tasting menu featuring scallops with miso, wild garlic and onion. Wildflower is on the new Buck Street Market, close to the hot-pink terrace designed for selfies and street-food kiosks with names like Killa Waffles, Studmuffin and Lord of the Wings. So far, 2020 has offered me a rich glut of awry dining experiences, but Wildflower trumps them all with its attempt to meld Eleven Madison Park with a corner of Zeebrugge shipping port, let alone opening during a pandemic, meaning the staff are masked and footfall is obliterated. Adrian Martin, sir, I salute your courage, strength and indefatigability. Martin, from Cavan in Ireland, is 28, has been cooking since he was 16 and his website claims he was recently dropped in a forest in Dorset by a TV crew and challenged to roam free and cook using only found items. In the olden days, we simply called this ancient art Wombling. Wildflower’s seven-course evening tasting menu began with “snacks” of a slightly dry parmesan choux “profiterole” and an oyster strewn with cubed cucumber and purslane. Soda bread was served with butter perched on a rock. “I’ll leave you guessing what the secret ingredient is in the oyster,” the server said, like an MR James character. He never did tell us. This already felt as if it could be a rather long meal, despite a cold glass of côtes de gascogne, while Smooth Operator by Sade blared over the stereo before merging into Bon Jovi’s Livin’ On A Prayer. “What we have done with the hen of the woods is to serve it classic, but with a twist,” the waiter informed us while revealing the said fungus smothered in viscous oozings, foamy puddles and grated truffle. (The speedier lunch menu seems heartier, with slow-cooked pollock and raspberry soufflé on offer.) Still, we’d committed to the full yahoo. Summer minestrone was my favourite course: a sharp, joyous, well-balanced bowl of fresh tomato, broad beans and peas with a dressing of yarrow, which grew abundantly in the north when I was small and never struck me as something to cook, though I suppose that’s exactly the point of this restaurant. The main event – a generous chunk of salt-aged lamb rump – arrived sitting on, we were told solemnly, “last year’s plums”. After almost five months of not laughing much at all, I think the phrase “last year’s plums” has finally given me back my sense of humour. I sat rocking with laughter, attempting to enjoy the bitter slices of red fruit. “I can see why they had some left over,” Charles said sadly. A pudding of caramel tart with dandelion root ice-cream was delicious – it was simply proper home cooking; a tiny pre-dessert of beetroot, white chocolate, yoghurt and pistachio was similarly delightful. Still, Wildflower is a bumpy ride. After our first glass of wine, no one asked if we wanted another. This is the folly with offering exciting new slants on fine dining: it either is or it isn’t, and Wildflower doesn’t even have a bathroom of its own. There is a communal loo for all the shops and kiosks outside and up a set of stairs. It was spotlessly clean and guarded by a gang of bouncers, but as I’ve written before, about places such as Wapping Wharf in Bristol, this kind of thing lends a different edge to dinner. Wildflower is peculiar, but it’s a night I won’t forget. • Wildflower Buck Street, Camden Market, Camden High Street, London NW1, 07799 357396.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(252,'2020-11-15T06:00:27Z','Chishuru, London: ‘Show it some love’ – restaurant review','Editor’s note: this review took place before the current lockdown was imposed Chishuru, Unit 9, Market Row, Coldharbour Lane, London SW9 8LB (07960 002 150). Starters £5-£6, mains £12-£15, dessert £6, wines from £26 In late 2018 I was approached by a PR representing the property company that had recently bought Brixton Village and Market Row, two covered markets in the heart of my corner of south London. Both spaces, traditionally home for retail businesses serving the needs of the local community, had gone through a decade of major change. From a period of low occupancy and dwindling footfall they had become hubs for small cafés, bars and restaurants slipping in alongside what remained of those original traders. Once upon a time, you went there to stock up on great-value yams and mooli, tilapia and cow’s foot and the rest; now you could also go for a cracking bowl of tom yum soup, and a heat-blistered sourdough pizza. The change had been brisk and with it had come justifiable concerns over untrammelled gentrification. Were the excellent flat whites at risk of pushing out the supply of things that locals, often on low incomes, actually needed? Now here was Hondo Enterprises headed up by Taylor McWilliams, who is variously described as a wealthy Texan socialite, a DJ and a property developer. Did I want to sit down with their executives for a coffee, and would I help judge a competition to find a new cooking star who would be awarded their own space within the markets? I declined. I was wary of Hondo. As I saw it, they weren’t the owners. They were the custodians of a vital neighbourhood asset and I wanted to see how they discharged that duty before I considered getting cosy with them. I think it was the right call. Hondo was soon locked in a battle with the community which involved attempting to relocate and raise the rent on Nour Cash and Carry, an extraordinary family-run food shop selling cheap ingredients to the many BAME families that have long lived in Brixton. After a sustained community campaign, Hondo changed tack. During the row, one of the chefs who had signed on to judge that original cooking competition felt the need to apologise for having got involved with the company at all. Well he can relax. Because the winner, Nigerian-born Adejoké “Joké” Bakare, has just opened her restaurant in Market Row, and it’s one of the good things to come out of the current ownership. And because I wasn’t a judge, hurrah, I can write about it. Chishuru started out as a supper club, focusing on what Bakare felt were the lesser-known dishes from West Africa. Now Chishuru has become a small restaurant with peach-coloured walls, and an open kitchen where she cooks with the help of just one assistant, amid the occasional billow of flame and the shout of “service”. The menu is short and full of heat and vigour and zest, in some cases with the latter, literally so. Cassava is here shredded and deep fried to produce an intricate, knotty bird’s nest of a fritter with boundless crunch and crack. Two of them are perched on a salsa of grated coconut and lime, waiting to be scooped into its nooks and crannies. It’s food you must play with. In another starter, meaty chicken gizzards are roasted with tiny cubes of plantain, all of it under a boisterous chilli and citrus sauce, giving heft to a humble part of the bird that, as the French might say, only an idiot would leave behind. Both starters are a fiver. For £6 there’s grilled king prawns, wallowing in a seafood broth that’s heavy with cracked black pepper and nutmeg. I tear at the tails, drop the heads into the liquor, then return to them for spice-boosted suckage. Our napkins become properly stained and sit on the table beside us like badges awarded by the Brownies in recognition of effort made. Goat has been stewed on the bone, in a deep, lightly oily sauce of green peppers and onions. It’s no looker. After all that stewing there’s more than a grey-brown tinge to the bowl. But we all know the best foods are not necessarily the prettiest. The meat is just waiting to leave home. A whole sea bass is glazed with a caramelised onion sauce and served with more of the same on the side, the pearly flesh slipping away to reveal a perfect film-fun skeleton. What makes all this fly is the trio of sides for a tenner: the brightly dressed green salad, the toasty slices of caramelised plantain and best of all the atassi rice: a huge bowl of “come home and let me look after you”. The rust-red, pillow-soft rice and beans are topped with a sweet-sour escabeche of slow-cooked onion and peppers. I pair the rice with the goat as expected, but really, I just want the bowl in front of me so I can bow my head in supplication and disappear into its comforting, non-judgmental depths. Thank you, Joké for taking care of me. At the start I have a cocktail of rum, lime and blitzed plantain that turns out to be a shade of duodenal brown. Ignore the colour and enjoy its sweet, boozy kick. At the end there is peanut ice-cream, with lemony meringue. In between there is almost a handful of serviceable wines. As in there are just the four of them. The entire front-of-house team – a lovely chap in plaid shirt and mask – works the room with vigour, like he has a huge bustling brasserie at his feet. He has good reason to be cheerful. For all the distancing of the tables, which spread out into the arcade beyond the door, tonight Chishuru is proper bustling with Brixton locals, happy to be out with each other. In normal times I rarely review on my own doorstep, despite the many terrific possibilities that are stacked up around me. I just don’t relish one local restaurateur getting all pouty at me for reviewing a competitor rather than them. But these are not normal times. I ate at Chishuru just as the dizzying and confused Covid-19 tier system had been introduced. Since then this lovely new restaurant has been forced to close by the current lockdown. Sooner rather than later, I hope, Joké’ Bakare’s Chishuru will reopen and, when it does, like all our most beloved local restaurants, it will need the support of its neighbours. It’s a portion of the community on a plate, and one that has all too often been overlooked, including by me. It deserves to be shown some serious love. News bites Beder, a charity raising awareness around mental health issues and suicide prevention, has just published a cookbook. From Beder’s Kitchen, named after Beder Mirjan who took his own life aged 18 in 2017, contains contributions from a number of chefs including Atul Kochhar, Yotam Ottolenghi and Romy Gill who have provided both recipes and reflections on how food can help us look after our mental health (beder.org.uk). Rick Stein’s restaurants have relaunched their Stein at Home range. The boxes, which require some preparation at home, start at £40 for the hake menu for two which includes mackerel paté to start, followed by grilled hake piperade with serrano ham and minted potatoes and a sticky toffee pudding to finish. It tops out at £85 for the Cornish lobster box for two. Delivery is nationwide and takes place on a range of days through November (shop.rickstein.com). At the other end of the country Simon Rogan of L’Enclume in Cumbria has launched a range of delivery boxes which now includes a five-course Christmas lunch targeted at 25 December itself. It starts with his truffle pudding and goes through a roasted onion broth and cured trout before the main event: Norfolk black turkey with a rye, bacon and sage and onion stuffing and a whole bunch of other things besides.

I’m back in the game. I can return to using my posh pans purely for decorative purposes and opening my fridge to find just a two-day-old doggy bag and a kilo of dissolving carrots. Phew. I can even eat dinner in three specific courses, rather than loading a plate with colliding items: a Quorn sausage, some olives from a jar, leftover takeaway flatbread and hummus that has a partial beard. Dinner will have shape again and, afterwards, the plates will be whisked away. Also – and this will be the best part for some – we can dine with other people again. Sure, there may be bits of Perspex and face masks dotted about the place, but overlook that: 4 July has the vibe of Whitehall slapping the opening chords of Thin Lizzy’s The Boys Are Back In Town on the jukebox. Clearly, there are new rules, so I began digesting the 47 pages of government guidelines that will allow us this freedom. Then I realised that’s all they are: guidelines. Yards and yards of them, and none of them obligatory or legislated for. Instead, restaurateurs have been put in charge, with a little help from the local authority overlooking the grand comeback in much the same way as they check food hygiene standards. This feels like chaos, but at least it’s chaos with a serving bar, which is the epitome of Britishness. Our fine nation is built on centuries of wild ideas, blind optimism and half-baked plans fuelled largely by daytime drinking. Obviously, the more delicate, touchy-feely question – the one we’re possibly too scared to ask each other – is: “Are you brave enough to come out?” Brave, foolhardy, nonchalant, keen to get back to normal – whatever you wish to call it. These people will be the first bums on seats, buying marked-up wine, ordering extra fries for the table, paying service charges and flourishing their wallets in myriad ways that may keep some restaurants afloat over the summer. I worry more, however, for the other camp, the quietly-staying-puts and the possibly-too-embarrassed-to-say section of society. All those people who have been scared witless for months by stark thoughts about mortality, germ spread and second waves; the diners for whom restaurants will never again feel safe enough. Nor will any journey to dinner on public transport, let alone the return leg home accompanied by strangers swaying tipsily. As I booked a table for the big comeback, in central London, where the roads will be closed off and the government seems to have set the whole vibe to that of the 2012 London Olympics’ Super Saturday, the emails I sent my friends were open-ended and tentative. They were less, “When are we having dinner?” and more a gentle, “If you would like to join me, this is where I will be, and possibly you could come along? If it’s too early for all this, I understand.” Some people replied with alacrity, champing at the bit for a couple of bottles, a proper entrée, a pudding and a good gossip, while others were more furtive. I have daily conversations with my mother – 105 days in the house now, and counting – who demands to be set free to eat scones, but also rejects my every suggestion as too cramped, too large or too prone to coach parties. Her freedom has been granted, but in her head I fear she’ll be forever trapped. As a restaurant critic, I’ve decided, possibly controversially, to live without fear and to treat death as an occupational hazard. I’ve hidden for months, but it has given me time to think. Death bothered me little in my youth; there was danger all around, but I went out every night and just assumed I was probably immortal. I rode mopeds across Ibiza and set out for -1C, sideways-sleet nights in Cumbria in a mini-skirt with bare legs. I spent years on smoking terraces breathing in everyone’s fumes, drank way more than the recommended daily units of alcohol a day and survived a quarter-century of using the bathrooms – hand sanitiser? Ha! – at some of London’s most venerable fleapits. I’m still standing, as Elton said. If the next six months kill me, I want you to know that, when the grim reaper finally caught up, I’d had a lovely three-course lunch beforehand.','https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jul/03/the-reopening-of-restaurants-feels-like-chaos-but-at-least-there-is-a-bar-grace-dent','Grace Dent','The reopening of restaurants feels like chaos, but at least there''s a bar | Grace Dent on restaurants',-2.45438910000000021,54.2776946999999907,0.476700000000000012);

Small plates £4.40-£8.80, mains £8.90-£15.80, desserts £3.80-£4.20, beers £3.50, wines from £17 The stretch of North Street that Wen’s calls home, just up from where arterial routes snake around the city centre, is not one of Leeds’s loveliest. Although there are other destinations here – the much-admired Reliance, the idiosyncratic Swine That Dines – it still feels like it’s competing with the traffic. Even so, when my cab pulls up outside numbers 72 to 74, I feel a flutter in my chest, which I quickly identify as a sweet burst of nostalgia’s butterflies. In 1986 a restaurant opened here called Hansa’s, serving the vegetarian food of Gujarat. The head chef, Hansa Dhabi, had never before worked in a professional kitchen, but people loved the Gujarati snacks she cooked for fundraisers. With the support of her family, she decided to give it a go. Many decades before Asma Khan’s much-lauded Darjeeling Express, Dhabi opened here with an all-female staff. I was a third-year student at Leeds University at the time, flirting with the notion of being a grown-up. A year or so before I had leaned over from bed and retuned the transistor on my bedside table from Radio Aire to Radio 4. I was clearly now a man. I needed eating opportunities which reflected that. Hansa’s had a deep green frontage and a fancy, wood-floored dining room which set it apart from the sturdy, flocked-wallpapered curry houses opposite the university. Because it was entirely meat-free it was relatively cheap, but the food was anything but basic. I recall intricate thalis, stacked with potent, complex curries and dals; salads and chutneys, presented in small, stainless steel cylindrical dishes, fitted in turn on to a circular metal tray. On the side there were puffed and flaky breads. It was a revelation and I felt like an adult simply for enjoying this food. I went back repeatedly until finally I left Leeds a couple of years later. I missed Hansa’s but Hansa’s didn’t miss me. It endured for another 30 years. Dhabi closed the restaurant last year, retaining only the cookery school she had earlier opened as her retirement project. I’m aware I’ve written a love letter to a restaurant that no longer exists. No apologies. Hansa’s fully deserves it. But there is also context. Because the Chinese venture which has replaced it represents continuity. It too is a family affair. And the matriarch also plays a big part. “All our dumplings and xiao long bao are homemade by Mrs Wen,” the menu declares. This is worth knowing. The ready-made Chinese dumpling market in the UK has become extremely sophisticated. Often, the ones you eat in Chinese restaurants will have come in bags from the local Asian supermarket. Some can be very good. I have a freezer full of them. But Mrs Wen’s are so much better. The spicy, minced beef pan-fried dumplings have gossamer and silky skins, which are precisely crisped on the bottom. They hold a dense, spiced filling, leaking enough juices to mimic soupy dumplings. I could come here and just give the dumpling list a very good seeing to. The Wen family are originally from Shandong, though the menu ranges widely across many Chinese traditions, with vigorous nods towards Sichuan. In truth, the options are double the size they appear, courtesy of a note saying they can cook you pretty much any Anglo-Cantonese classic. Choose the sauce – sweet and sour, say, or black bean – and the protein. Do that if you wish, but you’ll be missing the fun. The nearest thing to a standard we have is their pokey salt and pepper baby squid, a pert heap of almost shockingly crisp but tender golden tentacles. From the less familiar end of things there is also, listed among the cold starters, a salad of julienned potato, cooked so it still has bite, then dressed with enthusiastic glugs of chilli oil. I see it on menus rarely and have to order it when I do, because it is unlike any other potato dish I have ever come across, in any culinary tradition. It manages to be both a warm hug and a cheery slap around the chops at the same time. A whole seabass arrives on a classic, gold-rimmed plate, of a sort that Alan Bennett would have recalled a relative in Leeds keeping on the cabinet in the front parlour for best. The substantial fish lies in a bold, deep sauce of minced pork and chilli, which is an unapologetic Trumpian orange. The white flesh falls away from the bone with a nudge so that it looks like a tan line against the mess of that chilli. Somehow the subtlety of the fish is not overwhelmed by this high-octane action. Then there’s “crispy sliced lean pork in special made sweet and sour sauce”. The specialness is not so much in the sauce, which is basically a lightly spiced syrup which will set on the plate if you don’t get in quickly enough. It lies in the whole outrageous, roaring, blistered and curled confection. Thin slices of pork have been thickly battered and deep-fried until bubbled and glass-like, then drenched in the caramel. When it arrives, we can still hear it fizzing and crackling. (I’ll post a video to Instagram, where I am @jayrayner1.) Oh lordy. There’s no point pretending. This dish is built on the infantilising qualities that fast-food corporations have made billions from: deep-frying, sugar, carb-rich batter, sugar, a surfeit of protein and sugar. It’s an utter, shocking disgrace. It is also fabulous. I suspect you knew that. We are not oblivious to the call of vegetables. A dish of sweetcorn and pine nuts is not something I’ve seen on a Chinese menu before. It’s exactly as described: a heap of sweetcorn and pine nuts, with a few peas and chopped carrots. Hilariously, it recalls the mixed veg from 70s school dinners. Happily, a heap of steamed broccoli with copious sliced garlic is the enlivener we need. There are desserts, including banana fritters coated with crispy shredded potato, and homemade pumpkin pancakes. Our sweet tooth has been more than satisfied by that pork, so we decline. I leave with a sense that I have barely scratched the surface of what the kitchen at Wen’s can do. More pleasingly, I leave knowing that I have a very good reason to keep going back to this site on North Street; to the place where my independent restaurant going began. It’s an extremely comforting thought. Newsbites As Covid-19 restrictions tighten it’s worth looking at delivery options once more. Chef Robert Thompson, of Thompson’s on the Isle of Wight, was delivering meal bags close by, throughout lockdown. Now he’s moved to a more evolved offering, delivered nationwide. Menus might include a terrine of smoked eel, duck liver and ham hock to start followed by a wood pigeon “wellington”, with a dark chocolate delice to finish. It’s from the top end of the market at a pokey £45 a head, but Thompson does come with a bunch of awards to his name. Helpfully, the website lists menus a few weeks ahead. ubchef.com The hospitality industry response to the government’s new 10pm curfew, to reduce cases of Covid-19, has not been universally positive, with industry bodies arguing it’s unfair given there was no uptick in cases during August, when the industry saw a boost to business due to the Eat Out To Help Out scheme. Charlie McVeigh, founder of the Draft House restaurant and bar group, has called on colleagues to write to their MP ahead of a vote in the House of Commons next week to renew emergency lockdown powers, asking them to oppose the move. And positive news.

Small plates £6-£14, large plates £17-£32, desserts £4-£6, wines from £23 The area around London’s Old Street roundabout tells us a lot about where we are now. For all the modish apartment blocks, their balconies stacked with top-of-the-range bikes, this is where many people come to work, or did. For now, lots of those offices remain empty. Accordingly, many of the cafés and bars that served them are still closed. Above the door of the coffee shop Shoreditch Grind, one of the few around here to have reopened, is the legend “Alexa skip to 2021”. It’s a slogan we can all get behind. But here, on City Road, just south of the roundabout, is a pulsing sign of life. Even on a quiet weekday lunchtime, when custom is thin on the ground, everything about Daffodil Mulligan – the food, the staff, the well-spaced sunlit room with its polished concrete floors and olive-green banquettes – thrums with a certain optimism. It’s a slap on the back. It’s a splash of cold water on the cheeks. It’s a crushing bear hug of a welcome. Daffodil Mulligan first opened last November as a side project between three Irishmen with oceans of experience in hospitality: the publican Tony Gibney who has Gibney’s of Malahide just outside Dublin, the London-based restaurateur John Nugent, and the chef and restaurateur Richard Corrigan. The name comes from a song by Harry O’Donovan and Eva Brennan about the daughter of Biddy Mulligan, a famous Dublin street seller. According to the lyric, “all the fellas” say Daffodil “is a peach and pearl”. Step in here for a bit of Dublin craic. Inadvertently, in these times, that name has another resonance, for the daffodil is a fighter; one of the first brilliant flowers to break through winter’s gloom. And here, now, is its namesake, complete with roaring grill and a menu full of hilariously huge, uncompromising flavours, standing proud, refusing to back down. While the head chef is Simon Merrick, what defines the cooking is Corrigan’s career-long bravado. Although he has the undoubtedly fancy Corrigan’s just off Park Lane, he’s always been a pleaser and a feeder. During lockdown I was often asked where I imagined myself once everything reopened. I always said at the bar of Bentley’s, Corrigan’s seafood bistro just off Piccadilly, for the best oysters and spiced mussel soup and fish pie. It’s where I have long taken my own tattered wallet for a moderate to serious spanking. Bentley’s was about to reopen as I visited Daffodil Mulligan, though they were already supplying it with their nutty, treacly soda bread. It arrives alongside their own churned butter the colour of, well, daffodils. This venture is a more moderately priced proposition than either Corrigan’s or Bentley’s. From the small plates, for £6, there are whorls of seashore-rich whipped cod’s roe, with taut cubes of cured salmon, dusted with dried, powdered seaweed. Salt-chilli chicken brings the very crunchiest, curled and bubbled pieces of thigh, caught somewhere between a Japanese karaage and Southern-fried with, on the side, pickled cucumber boosted with chilli. It costs £8. From the specials board, at £7 there is celeriac, lifted from its pig-ugly origins, to something dark and deeply attractive, courtesy of a salt baking and anointing with an apple-hazelnut brown butter. There is nothing subtle about any of this food. It laughs in the face of subtlety. This is cooking determined to show you a good time, and to wear a party hat while doing so. In truth, there is a fourth Irishman involved here. I hesitate to mention him, because I’ve mentioned him so regularly, but I don’t hesitate for that long because Peter Hannan’s meat is just so damn good. Here comes some of his famed beef, raised on Northern Irish clover and aged in a salt-lined room which may or may not be the key to its flavour. But then we all love a USP. It’s served raw as a rough chopped tartare and bound in a punchy mustard dressing. It arrives on an oyster shell, itself on a pile of ice, with a big dollop of a funky oyster-flavoured cream and a single oyster leaf. It’s steak tartare with a serious haircut and a bit of attitude. Hannan’s beef is there on the specials as a big steak for two to share and also, for £17, as a thick-cut sugar-pit bacon rib. Hannan’s sugar-pit bacon is a wonder when simply roasted, so that the fat caramelises dark and sticky. Here, it’s also glazed with fiery gochujang, and laid on a smoked tomato purée alongside Swiss chard, because we must all be good and eat our greens. From the menu section headed “wood oven &amp; grill” we get a thick fillet of ember-baked gurnard, lubricated with a ripe anchovy sauce, alongside bitter leaves. This power and depth continues with the sides. Of course the cavolo nero comes with chilli and garlic. Of course the mash is topped with a bone marrow crumb. What’s remarkable is that while it’s all terribly muscular and forthright, it somehow never tips into overkill. It’s a difficult trick to pull off. Desserts continue the come-hither joys: lime cheesecake with candied jalapeño; baked boozy apple with spiced ice-cream; soft-serve vanilla with caramel popcorn. We have space to share just a lemon meringue tart with clotted cream. It’s very pretty to look at: a dinky, tucked and curved single tart case of golden flaky pastry with a citrus-boosted filling. My only criticism is that it’s small, which means an imbalance: too much pastry to filling. I understand how this reads. I was too full for dessert and am now complaining about the meagreness of my choice. My life is full of such awful contradictions. The booze list necessarily includes Guinness alongside beers to accompany the wines and cocktails, and downstairs is a wood-clad bar in which to drink them. At the end is a stage complete with a very nice, shiny, well-tuned piano. I know it’s tuned because I checked. Sorry. Couldn’t stop myself. The time for live music will come again. At some point we really will have skipped to 2021. In the meantime, come here to eat. News bites Recipe box services like Hello Fresh and Mindful Chef have inspired upmarket competition. Wild Radish, launching this month, is a raw ingredients subscription service of recipes by high-end chefs like Phil Howard, Anna Hansen and Alyn Williams, delivered London-wide for now, before rolling out.

All dishes £4-£12.50, beer £6, cocktails £9.50, wine from £36 a bottle There’s lots about Untitled, a bar in Dalston, calculated to drive people like me who don’t think they’d want to go there, completely nuts. Start with the name. It’s called Untitled, but it isn’t untitled, is it, because it has a name. That name is Untitled which… Oh never mind. It has bleak, rough-plastered walls and a front space dominated by a huge communal table where I imagine, in better times, complete strangers would have sat elbow to elbow, being annoyingly friendly. Music plays, quite loudly. Not so you have to shout. Right now, we don’t hold with shouting, but the music is there, battering away. Out back, there is a moon garden. That’s what they call it. I won’t argue. Untitled belongs to the revered cocktail guru Tony Conigliaro, and has always seemed first and foremost to be a bar, although there has often been food. Since it opened in 2018 it has hosted a series of short chef residences, which is another reason for me to stay away. There’s little point you being told about all the things you could have eaten there from a short-lived menu, but can’t now because it’s gone. As you’ve worked out by now, I didn’t recognise Untitled as being designed for me. Then they announced JAE, an extended Korean-influenced residency from an intriguing chef named Jay Morjaria. It’s running until at least Christmas and probably beyond, from Wednesday to Saturday each week. It was time. And now you’re expecting a classic bait and switch, with me announcing I’d got the place all wrong. I hadn’t. Untitled really isn’t the sort of place in which I’d choose to spend my time. I’ve never been a big one for rough plaster. I love a bit of brutalism, but too much of it makes me think NCP car park. It’s a short lurch from there to recalling the blistering scent of an NCP car park stairwell. That’s never an aid to digestion. Their piped music is not my piped music. I have no need of a moon garden. And it really is primarily a bar, as signalled by the Korean word “Anju” at the top of the menu. It references food designed to be eaten alongside drinks. The list of cocktails at £9.50 a pop is much longer than the wine list where the cheapest bottle is £36. Asahi is £6 a pint. And yet, Morjaria’s heavily plant-based, tightly written menu is very good value with the majority of dishes priced between £4 and £8 and nothing above £12.50. Plus, behind the socially distanced communal table, is a dining room. I am at ease there. Morjaria is a restless soul. He ran one of London’s first vegetarian cookery schools, Sutra Kitchen, before appearing on BBC’s Million Pound Menu with an earlier iteration of his Korean and Japanese dishes informed by his research and travels. He won a chunk of investment, though that plan doesn’t appear to have come to fruition. Instead, he has worked London’s guest-chef circuit. Now he’s here with a menu so succinct that we manage most of it. There is a plate of his pickles and kimchi to start, in candy shades of pink and orange. Alongside is a scoop of whipped butter blitzed with spring onions, so it’s the colour of pool-table baize. There are slices of crisp-crusted sourdough from Dusty Knuckle bakery, round the corner, with which to do that butter justice. Make sure your companion eats some as well. It stays in the memory and on the breath. Chargrilled friggitelli peppers, looking like padron’s grown-up, streetwise cousins, come with a dollop of smooth, scoopable, silken tofu flavoured with lemon and a jolly sprinkle of Morjaria’s take on Shin Ramyun seasoning (the spicy seasoning mix for instant ramen noodles). Chopped aubergines are roasted until the skins are chewy and then dressed with a thick coconut and lime sauce, with fried panko breadcrumbs for extra crunch. We have a cooling noodle salad in a sweet-sour gochugaru dressing, expertly designed for slurpage, topped with finely diced pickled cucumbers and a bowl of completely compelling new potatoes that have been burst from their skins and fried until crisp, with a sesame dressing for lubrication. From the meatier side there is a killer chicken sandwich, made with deep-fried undulating thigh, in a soft, sweet bun with curry mayo and pickled cucumbers. There’s a lot of this about at the moment and there’s no point trying to pretend it’s either elegant or sophisticated. It’s far too instantly gratifying for that. Crunchy things inside soft buns are always a winner. This is a very good version. The most recognisable dish from the Korean repertoire is the pork belly ssam (with mushrooms for non-meat eaters). Blocks of braised pork belly have been glazed with a sauce leaning heavily on gochujang, the strident fermented chilli paste that makes everything it meets bounce and sing. There’s rice, pickles, extra sauce and lettuce leaves to wrap it all in – the meaning of ssam. It’s an engrossing, jolly plateful for £12.50. Less recognisable is a daily special of bone marrow roasted under more gochujang, with shards of toasted rice cracked up from the bottom of the rice cooker. Some may not appreciate the wobbly brain-like texture. I do. It’s a version of Fergus Henderson’s famous bone marrow dish, after a gap year backpacking across Asia. There are two desserts, each at £4. I rather wish there was just one, at £8. The thick block of chocolate ganache with miso caramel is so intense it leaves me feeling like I’ve been left unfairly with the box of chocolates, despite everyone knowing I have no self-restraint. Paired with the citron tea sorbet from the other plate, however, it all balances out nicely, and I stop hating myself. Result. Service, mostly from waiters in identical patterned shirts and masks so you can’t tell them apart, is chipper and enthusiastic. Occasionally, dishes are brought to the table by Morjaria himself, a dashing, intense figure in a leather apron, with a close crop of perfectly poised silver-fox grey hair. It makes me feel a little less out of place. I may not be the target demographic, but I am not entirely alone here among the youth. You may decide to come here because of all the things I’ve described. You may come in spite of them. Either way you’ll get some seriously punchy and diverting cooking. News bites Beak, a micro-brewery in Lewes, East Sussex, is running a series of chef take-overs of its taproom space each Saturday. So far they’ve featured everything from wood-fired local game to the cooking of Malaysia and Uganda. Forthcoming events include Karen Chepkurui cooking Kenyan dishes, various takes on tacos from Brighton stalwart Casa Azul and next Saturday, an eclectic menu from Lewes-based catering and teaching kitchen Seven Sisters Spices. Individual dishes tend to cost between £6 and £9 (beakbrewery.com). On 12 November The Fisheries, a co-working space in London’s Hackney, will host a dinner in aid of The Pilot Light, a project designed to open up the conversation around mental-health issues for employees in the catering industry. The five-course autumnal menu, cooked by chef Andrew Clarke, will be served family style to groups of up to six. Tickets cost £50 a head and are available from eventbrite.co.uk. And it’s a big hello to Caribbean operator Rudie’s Jerk Shack, which will open a full-service restaurant in Brixton’s Market Row in November, to go alongside their two take-away only outlets in Shoreditch and Borough Market. The menu includes both jerk chicken and jerk pork as well as curry goat and peppered shrimp (rudieslondon.com).

Paris or Lisbon, they always say, as if two, maybe three days just off the A10 would not bring back the magic, too. Well, those people don’t deserve Birch, a mind-bendingly ambitious project that’s taken over a hotel and conference centre and its 55 acres of nature, and parachuted in the well-respected chef Robin Gill to open The Zebra Riding Club in what was once a stable block. I don’t have the emotional bandwidth to change the spotlights in my kitchen right now – I’d rather cook in the dark – so it’s comforting that someone out there is thinking, “Why don’t we open a ginormous, almost indefinable community drop-in experience with candle-making lessons and gong baths and ping-pong and 140 bedrooms.” Birch sees itself as a wellness-focused community where customers can release and re-set – you can read all sorts of this cosmic mumbo-jumbo on the website, which positions the place as a hinterland between Babington House and a Branch Davidian ranch. This would all seem to point to Gill serving some sort of purging, waist-sculpting, freegan, chakra-balancing juicing menu, and to The Zebra Riding Club being a bit po-faced and joyless. But that is completely untrue. This is very much a Gill restaurant along the lines of Darby’s, one of my favourite places in London. Here, he is working alongside Ben Rand, from another Gill success, The Dairy in Clapham, and Sussex farmer Tom Morphew to provide a farm-to-table menu for both here and a more casual, all-day restaurant called Valeries. The Zebra Riding Club serves a five-part tasting menu consisting of several snacks, smaller courses of soupy things and one larger main that is, however you dress it up, Swaledale salt-marsh lamb with potatoes. This is food that aims to feed you and send you away jolly. On the Wednesday evening we visited, it was pleasingly busy, which was surprising, because trying to get a reservation through the main switchboard had involved an arduous maze of dropped calls or phones ringing out, possibly because the staff were all too busy running the Bauhaus plate-painting session or the Sass &amp; Soul dance workshop. Birch says it wants to create a festival ambience, which sounds like more hot air, except when you enter the large courtyard at the entrance to The Zebra Riding Club, they’ve lit pit fires, so the drifting smoke combines with the scents of the 55 acres of arboreal splendour and the sudden bolt of fresh air from leaving the city to give you an odd sense of opening your car door at Glastonbury. The restaurant is in a huge, capacious, open barn, with a visible kitchen. Staff are bright and charming, and not remotely airily cool. We began with some snacks of the freshest, most delicious Cantabrian anchovies on toasted sourdough, then a small, pleasing tartlet featuring one solitary, but meaningful slice of grezzina courgette. This was followed by grilled ox tongue Reuben-style and some warm, fresh sourdough made from Gilchesters porridge and served with smoked cultured cream with miso and a side of pickled beets. Then came one of those moments when Gill and his team always win my heart, wherever they’re cooking. “We’re calling this a hug in a mug,” the server said while leaving me with a small bowl of what the menu calls “heritage grains with Kentish corn”, but which was instead a sort of warm, spicy, enveloping, Thai-style, vegetable soup fragrant with nam pla and fresh corn and barley. The next offerings were from the sea: red mullet wrapped in nori, Cornish crab and Porthilly oysters. Star of the show, officially (although I’d give that award to the fabulous soup), was the aforementioned lamb, which turns up with enough extras to make it a banquet. This is where all semblance of a tasting-style menu leaves the building and you are faced with not just the meat, but also a rich ragu and bowls of Badger Flame beetroot, fresh coco beans, wood-oven-baked Cornish midi potatoes and a generous garden salad. Pudding was a large scoop of blackberry ripple ice-cream with peach and a fresh, warm, rosemary-scented sablé biscuit. I’ve thought of this pudding often since. It would make sitting through a macramé plant-hanger workshop quite tolerable. Life’s a Birch – or at least it is when Robin Gill is there in the midst, making magic. • The Zebra Riding Club Birch, Lieutenant Ellis Way, Cheshunt, Herts, 01992 645522.

As you approached, reports say, the driver would yell, “The Bull … and last”. Sleep through this stop, end up in Leeds. Now, hundreds of years later, The Bull &amp; Last offers new motives not to disappear up north. This is timely: despite Whitehall’s polite requests for Londoners to do Pret a Manger a solid favour and resume the old grind, there are presently more people by the cheese counter at Booths in Keswick than there are in Soho. The Bull &amp; Last suspended services in October 2018 for a grand redesign, with plans for a fresher, brighter pub with six new boutique-hotel rooms. Instead, it found itself in a pandemic, and ended up reopening as a takeaway and tap room, offering new ways to picnic on nearby Hampstead Heath with gravlax, Ferrero Rocher ice-cream and a litre of carry-out cinsault rosé, and serving up Sunday roasts with shorthorn beef from north Essex or spring green and taleggio pithivier. The food was always pretty decent at The Bull &amp; Last but, until recently, there was little to set it apart from the dozens of other slightly tarted-up old boozers that are now serving olives and merlot to locals. This new rebirth, however, establishes it as a destination in its own right, with cooking that’s careful, ambitious and surprising. Cuore del Vesuvio tomato tostado with black olive dressing and bronze fennel is basically a fancy name for tomatoes on toast, but, presented as they are here, they deserve a little talking up. Fat, sweet, red tomatoes from Campania with a terrific, punchy, vinegary dressing. A plate of good, warm Irish soda bread arrived with salted butter, which I ate with a glass of chilled Le Grapin beaujolais. The salmon smørrebrød is four fat chunks of pink, cured fish lounging on an earthy, horseradishy, slaw-like bed with boiled egg, strategically placed trout eggs and more decorative dill. Yes, battered haddock and triple-cooked chips is still on the menu, but The Bull &amp; Last is now giving itself room to be unapologetically fancy. Why have that when you can have roast Cornish cod with grilled hispi cabbage in a butter and dill sauce? By this point, I’d had rather a lot of dill and sharp, vinegary things, and then a buttermilk chicken sandwich turned up wrapped in pretty blue paper and teeming with gherkins, but it’s hard to be churlish about anything at The Bull &amp; Last. The staff are lovely, service is better than at most restaurants and they serve glorious British booze such as Sillymoo cider and Hammerton Oyster Stout. Despite its new lofty leanings, this is still somewhere to bring your family for scotch eggs, bowls of chips and a sunny day meet-up at one of the outdoor tables. It’s not easy for landlords to make the new Covid landscape feel smooth and welcoming, yet the Bull is now offering two specific sittings at lunch and dinner, with tables so wide apart, you could play boules down the centre of the pub, having first made a short stop at the front door to sanitise your hands and before being escorted to your table. This is almost as good as it gets in the new, nervous world of ever-moving guidelines. It must be impossible to please everyone. Err on the side of common sense, and some customers will feel edgy; err towards strict, and punters will feel lectured; and if you hide your new policies carefully, some won’t believe you’ve made any at all. It is no surprise, then, that many places aren’t bothering to reopen. But The Bull &amp; Last is back open for business, and offering a little slice of almost-normal. As the north of England went back into partial lockdown last week, scuppering my plans finally, finally to reunite with my family, I consoled myself with a plate of peanut butter cookies, banana ice-cream and hot chocolate sauce. I have never felt more, in the most bittersweet sense, like Shaun sat in The Winchester Tavern, waiting for this whole mess to blow over. I only hope it will. • The Bull &amp; Last 168 Highgate Road, London NW5, 020-7267 3641. Open Mon-Fri, noon-11pm, Sat 9am-midnight, Sun 9am-10.30pm.

Snacks and starters £2.25-£9, mains £12-£24 (all pies £14), desserts £6-£9.50, wines from £22.50 There are certain food items that make everything better. A well-made pie is one of them. The Windmill, a pub in London’s Mayfair, now serves very well-made pies. In the days following my dinner there, I kept thumbing open the photograph on my phone and gazing upon their steak and kidney pie, with its glazed suet pastry case, lightly crimped around the edges. It looked like a promise, fully kept. There was a time, many centuries ago, when pastry was used only as a lid on stews, or as a case to protect cuts of meat from the flames in the hearth. It would be discarded or fed to the pigs or, if the big house was conscious of its obligations, given to the poor. By the late medieval era we were putting fats into pastry and making it distinctly edible. Follow that golden thread all the way through history to this brilliant piece of steak and kidney loveliness. Which I didn’t order. Think about that for a moment. Faced by an extensive pie menu – not just steak and kidney but venison and mushroom, chicken, bacon and leek and so on – I chose something else. I allowed my companion, who had just celebrated a significant birthday, to have the pie. I am a very kind man. Also, I felt I had a responsibility to try other things on the menu. But you know what I really wanted. The Windmill, in a narrow lane just off Regent Street in London, is a 19th-century pub that has recently been colonised. It has been taken over by the team who run the Guinea Grill, four minutes’ walk away on Bruton Place. The Guinea is one of those London landmarks, a tight knot of rooms in which good steaks are eaten and big bottles of Bordeaux are drunk. It is famed for its mixed grill and, of course, its pies. I can’t pretend I like all the other clientele. It attracts a certain hooting, stomping, testicular crowd, many from the hedge-fund offices around here; the sort who encourage me to refine my plans for a policy of involuntary euthanasia to put us out of their misery when I become prime minister. But that’s not the Guinea’s fault. In 2016, Young’s installed the revered publican Oisín Rogers at the Guinea. He’s a man with the cheery looks of a children’s television presenter and the unflinching, steely room command of Bet Lynch of the Rovers in her pomp. He spruced up the menu, introducing a magnificent cooked breakfast, and cheered up the service. Now he’s been given dominion over the Windmill, also a Young’s pub. Nathan Richardson, the Guinea’s head chef, has come over, along with a number of other staff. As a result, it feels like an outcrop of the mothership. Vladimir, the broad-chested sommelier from the Guinea, is working the tables the night we go, offering a lengthy wine list that frankly looks absurd for a humble London pub. It transpires that this is essentially the Guinea’s list. “If someone orders something from the list, I go round the corner and get it,” he says. Thus, if you want to drink a 2005 Château Latour at £2,450 with your steak and kidney pie, you may. If that’s not your thing, there are lots of other less worryingly priced bottles. Downstairs is the pub bar with its own menu of devilled kidneys on toast, sausage rolls and fish fingers. There’s also that pie selection, which is more extensive than that at the Guinea and includes both a shepherd’s and a fish pie, and filo-wrapped option filled with pumpkin, chestnuts and mushroom. The upstairs dining room, with its green-blue walls and thick tablecloths, has a fancier menu, but you can order from both. Up here it starts with snacks for between £2.25 and £4.50: bouncy roasted chicken hearts with a sticky glaze on wooden skewers; straws of still-warm baked pastry brushed with a meaty reduction with a hilariously rich bone marrow mayo to help them along; a bowl of white crab meat with diced egg and toasted brioche; squares of cured lamb topped with a silvery curl of vinegared anchovy. You could order all of these as a starter. Or you could pretend they’re a British equivalent to cicchetti and order them alongside the starters. From the menu downstairs we have pert devilled kidneys served in a kicking sauce with a slow-release cayenne punch that soaks magnificently into the toast; from the menu upstairs comes a warm fillet of soused mackerel with a dollop of sour cream, and discs of crunchy carrot, all of it with a pickle that remains the right side of teeth-baring. And then that pie, with a pastry shell that cracks to reveal that it has been properly filled with solid lumps of braised beef and kidney in a gravy as deep as any James Joyce novel. My companion kindly scoops a corner of it on to my plate and I sigh. At the Guinea these pies come with a frilly paper collar. Mind you, at the Guinea they cost £18 and here it’s £14. You choose. I have the beef fore rib, which arrives carnation-bloom pink and neatly sliced, with a brioche crumb and more of that bone marrow mayo. It’s a grand piece of meat treated with care. And, yes of course, we have vegetables. There are peas. With pieces of bacon. Some of you will now be ranting about meat consumption and an unbalanced diet. Maybe I shouldn’t tell you the chips are cooked in beef dripping. Mind you, they’re the one failure. Those chips needed a longer bath in the melted animal fats. Does it help if I tell you that, after this, I needed to go back to the gym? Repeatedly? No, thought not. We finish with a sturdy treacle tart and some cracking meringues with blackberries. As in they cracked under the spoon to give way to the lusted-after chewiness beneath. We ate the night before the 10pm curfew was introduced and the sense of frustration among the staff was palpable. Young’s have launched an impressive app that enables you to book, order and pay without human interaction. Tables are spaced and the one-way system is in place. They’ve done everything they needed to do and like so many others have had to contend with the hollowing out of trade in the centre of town. If you feel comfortable with a night out, show the Windmill some love. You’ll be rewarded with terrific pie. News bites News from Manchester where Eat Well MCR, led by chef Mary-Ellen McTague among others, has been working since the start of the pandemic to provide meals for people in the city who need support. To raise funds, they have just launched the Eat Well MCR Marketplace, an online delivery service not just of meal kits from the likes of Elite Bistros and Baraxturi, but also pantry items, booze, fresh pastas, and meat and veg boxes from farms within 25 miles of the city. Check out the full offering at shop.eatwellmcr.org Meanwhile, elsewhere in the city a team with experience at Simon Rogan’s Fera and Stockport’s Where the Light Gets In, has taken over the restaurant space at the Ducie Street Warehouse just around the corner from Manchester Piccadilly station. On Fridays and Saturdays throughout October the venture, entitled Higher Ground, will serve a five-course tasting menu spotlighting produce from the North West, at £45 a head. To book visit exploretock.com Opposition to the 10pm curfew for restaurants and pubs is gathering pace, with both London mayor Sadiq Khan and Manchester mayor Andy Burnham calling for a review, siting crowds picking up alcohol supplies from supermarkets as the pubs close. On social media the campaign has codified around the hashtag #cancelthecurfew, and one operator, Jeremy Joseph of nightclub G-A-Y, has instructed lawyers to challenge the early closure rule in the courts.

Small plates £4.50-£9.50, big plates £8.50-£17.50, desserts £3.50-£7, wines from £27 Some people would take one look at the items in front of me at Smokestak, push their gnarled, slatboard chair back from their aggressively battered table, mutter “filthy muck” under their breath and walk away. Is it cooked food, or something you’d cook food over? Both the sawn-off beef rib and the plank of pork belly are not just darkly sauced. They’re mostly black, like something you’d rescue from the wreckage of a house fire while sobbing over what has been lost. I am not some people. I am the other sort of person, the one who looks at this and sees the long, virtuous interplay of fire, smoke and time on cow and pig muscle fibre; who sees only joyous caramelisation and the deep flavours gifted by the Maillard reaction, when heat says hello to amino acids and natural sugars and they all get along famously. I see only the good things. I see lunch. Barbecue obsessive David Carter opened Smokestak in 2016, after he’d spent years working the festival and street-food scene, turning a smoked brisket bun with pickled red chilli into a cult object. And when he finally got his hands on some bricks and mortar, he went all in. Those of us who spent too many nights in the early 1980s at the Camden Palace, mingling with Steve Strange’s menagerie of painted boys and taffeta-ed girls, will recognise this for what it is: one glorious, considered and completely uncompromising pose. For the sake of doubt, I am very fond of total poseurs. Carter took the business of opening an urban barbecue restaurant, in the heart of east London, very seriously indeed. It’s not just those ludicrously uncomfortable chairs, seemingly made from old wooden pallets. (Those of this column’s readers who make a point of complaining in the comments section online about how uncomfortable the seats look – I call them Team Haemorrhoid – will be appalled.) Nor is it those equally raw tables. It’s everything. The bare concrete walls have been artfully blackened as if years of soot have been absorbed by them. The windowpanes have a perfectly executed Dickensian frosting of brown-black faux “pollution” painted on to them. There is ducting, and naked wiring, and rough floors and hard edges. It’s catering inspired by Hieronymus Bosch; it’s the works canteen in the back carriages of Snowpiercer. The place is so distressed, I was tempted to Google a good therapist. All restaurant design is like this. That new French bistro that paints the walls a charming shade of nicotine yellow? It’s doing exactly the same thing. As is the tapas place that tiles the bar with blue ceramics, as is the sushi bar that splurges half the budget on blond wood. Restaurant design is about creating a space that tells you about the food you’re about to eat. Smokestak is no different. You may not like it. It may make you very cross. I do understand. If this is you: don’t go. At the heart of the operation is a very large smoker, of the sort you could you use to dispose of a body. It scents both the air and the food. A starter of crispy ox cheek with anchovy mayo brings four sizeable squared-off croquettes of beef that have been slow-cooked until a thrilling tangle of ripe, smoky fibres, before being breadcrumbed and deep-fried. They arrive white-flecked with crystals of salt against the dark brown. On the side is that mayo, to add an extra burst of salt and acidity. It’s a powerful and dramatic plateful for £6.50. The smoker gets involved in cooking most things, including a sprightly salsa made with charred sweetcorn. It comes with golden triangles of hand-pressed, slightly oily and salty corn tortilla. That famed brisket bun is on the menu, alongside a pulled-pork bun. You can also get both of the fillings by themselves, alongside other meats by 200g weights. The charred pork belly rib, served with pickled cucumber and red chilli, is sliced up and then reassembled into a whole, so it feels like you’re dismantling it. The crisped, sauced, charred surface gives way to a thin layer of fat on the verge of melting away, and then the soft meat below. The 30- day-aged beef short rib is a more solid and hefty version. Not everything here once had a pulse. A whole aubergine has been roasted over coals until the skin is blackened and blistered and the flesh has slumped. It’s then piled with roasted cashews, chopped spring onions and dribbles of bold, insistent red miso. The understanding of the need for acidity and heat alongside this kind of food is clear in their shouty ginger and green chilli slaw. It’s one of those viciously hot days in August, which dims the appeal of their sticky toffee pudding, even with the clotted cream ice-cream. Instead, I have their salty-sweet malt-flavoured soft serve, a huge whorl of the stuff, apparently dusted with neat Ovaltine, in a serving that goes right to the bottom of the cone, and eventually starts melting all over my hands. I’m not complaining. I’m enjoying myself here on this mannered stage set. I’d like to come back on a cooler day, when the food might better suit the weather. It’s obvious that this is cooking engineered for lubrication; accordingly, there’s a list of beers brewed relatively nearby in Dalston, King’s Cross and Bermondsey. There’s also a short cocktail and wine list. This post-lockdown world has many downsides for the hospitality business. Lots of restaurants simply haven’t reopened. Others are on shorter hours and fewer tables. Launches are in extremely short supply. The latter is a rare upside, at least for me. It blunts the ingrained neophilia of the journalist. We can’t simply go dribbling after the shiny and new, like the wet-lipped fashionistas we are prone to be, because it barely exists. This means I get to play catch-up. I am four years late to the Smokestak party. I intend to make up for lost time. Newsbites Throughout September, a collection of restaurants in London’s Chinatown are running the “Take-Put” campaign. The rather awkwardly-named campaign, a mash-up of Take-Out and Stay-Put, invites diners to get a take-out dish from one of the participating restaurants, priced at between £8 and £10, and then stay-put by eating it at the newly installed tables on Newport Place. Dishes include slow cooked pork belly with steamed rice from Leong’s Legend, beef rendang from the Malaysian C &amp; R Café, and sweet chilli kung po chicken from Plum Valley. chinatown.co.uk Another campaign for September: restaurant food delivery business Deliveroo is offering a discount of £5 on orders of £20 or more, from Monday to Wednesday throughout this month. The offer will run on the first 100,000 meals but only on orders from around 16,000 small independent restaurants. The larger national chains will be able to participate, but only if they fund it themselves. Sadly, there will be many permanent restaurant closures as a result of the pandemic and it will be impossible to list them all. But I have to mark the passing of the much-loved vegetarian and vegan restaurant Vanilla Black which first opened in York in 2004, before moving to London in 2008. It was a real trailblazer in the world of non-meat cookery and will be sorely missed.

Breakfast £3.50-£7; main dishes £6-£10; desserts £2-£4.25 Licensed A decade ago, when he was in his teens, Michael Owuo would come to Bluejay Café in London’s South Norwood after a heavy night out. “The Caribbean breakfast was the thing,” he says, stabbing at the laminated menu. “It’s a classic. Perfect for hangovers.” It looks like a substantial plateful for £7, perfectly engineered for a surfeit of booze: chicken or beef sausages, eggs, ackee and saltfish, fried dumpling, plantain and beans. “But get here too late in the morning and you’d never find a table,” he says. That’s not a problem these days, not now he’s traded Michael for Stormzy. He may have moved from South Norwood to leafy Kingston in southwest London. He may be the most famous former pupil of Stanley Tech, a man who has played the world’s biggest stages. But he still returns to Bluejay to eat. There’s a table reserved for us, up against a wall plastered with photographs of their regulars, of which he is one. So no, not a standard review. They knew both of us were coming. Instead it’s a snapshot of a particular slice of south London culture; the culture which made him. Joy and Dave Blake, both of whose families are Jamaican, opened Bluejay Café in 2008. Places like this are familiar to me; I’ve lived a couple of miles up the road in Brixton for almost 30 years, which has its own version, their windows steamed, the air crackling with easy chatter. They’re much more than just restaurants. They are a focus for community; a way of reasserting cultural identity, one heaving plateful of the familiar at a time. Rarely do they shout about themselves. They don’t need to because their customers know exactly where they are. They are an extension of the domestic, which means they can be unfairly overlooked and underestimated. The other customers here at Bluejay today are almost entirely black British, though you make assumptions about where their families are from, at your peril. “South London communities are seriously complicated,” Stormzy says. “I’m very Ghanaian, very West African.” At home his mum cooked jollof rice and okra stew and peanut soup. “As a kid I don’t ever remember eating vegetables. It was always big carbs – rice or yam or fufu – and then a stew.” But the Jamaican food here at Bluejay roots him, too. “If you’re African around here you know so much about Jamaican culture, and if you’re Jamaican you know so much about African culture.” He orders us both a fizzing glass of Mighty Malt. It is dark, and batters you around the head with huge caramel flavours. It’s like cola, in knuckle dusters. I admit that, despite three decades living around here, I’ve never before had one. “It’s an acquired taste,” he says. “And, you know, good after a heavy night out.” I leave him in charge of over-ordering. We start with golden fingers of salt fish fritter, both crisp and soft, sliced up into batons to be eaten with our hands. I ask him about food on tour. “Back in the early days,” he says, “it was a shit-show. Come off stage at 11pm and go for a McDonald’s. Get up the next morning and have a fry-up.” Eventually he concluded it was slowing him down for his full-on performance. “During my 2017 tour we had catering. We looked after ourselves.” And then there was the diet he went on ahead of his headline spot at this year’s Glastonbury. “It was 12 weeks, working with a nutritionist and a trainer. A lot of fish. There was mackerel and spinach in the morning, then I’d carb up until 5pm, then just protein and vegetables. It was gruelling. I was hungry all the time.” I ask if that was how he came to be so ripped when he performed with his top off at Glastonbury? He grins. “Yeah, that was it.” I tell him I’m relieved; that I thought he was just built like that. Joy starts delivering the food. First up a bowl of glossy oxtail stew, in a deep sauce made rich from the melting gelatine, after many, many hours of heat and care. It is sweet and salty and rich and sustaining on an afternoon with more than a hint of winter about it. You tug at the meat with knife and fork and then set about the bones with your hands. There’s also a bowl of curry goat (never goat curry). It is an earthy yellow, presumably from turmeric, and has a powerful kick of allspice and Scotch bonnet. “Don’t drop that down your shirt,” Stormzy says, as if he’s my mum. “You’ll never get the stain out.” These are the ingredients others might leave behind, pushed firmly to the centre of the stage. Naturally enough there is rice and peas. He also orders a bowl of jerk chicken broken into penne pasta. It feels like a nostalgic act, a reminder of the younger man in search of food to soak up the excesses of the night before. It’s not a subtle bowlful, under its overcoat of waxy melted cheese, but it’s easy to see how it would do the job. I get a single piece of jerk chicken, which comes sauced and properly grilled. Each summer the Lambeth Country Show is held in Brockwell Park just to the south of Brixton. It’s a cross between a classic country show, with flower-arranging tents and sheep shearing demonstrations, and a Caribbean festival. A haze of grill smoke settles across the fields from the many brilliant jerk stands. The jerk chicken here is a reminder of that. To finish we have apple crumble. Would we like custard with that? Yes, we would. What’s the point of crumble without custard? I wonder aloud whether they take credit cards here. Stormzy turns to one of his mates, who arrived with him and is sitting at another table. “Do they?” His friend says no. “But there’s a cashpoint over there,” he says, pointing across the road to the post office. After a full-on night out, they always needed to know where the nearest cashpoint is. Our lunch is done. We’ve run up a bill of £32, but only by over-ordering. Stormzy works his way around the room, leaning his enormously tall frame into eager groups, some of whom he knows, some of whom he doesn’t. Selfies are snapped, friends embraced. Joy takes a kiss on each cheek. And then he’s gone. The car? It’s a Lamborghini SUV, since you asked. Well of course it is. News bites Half Jamaican chef James Cochrane, who has worked at both the Ledbury and Harwood Arms, pulls irreverently on that heritage at his restaurant 1251 in London’s Islington. Try his buttermilk jerk spiced chicken with Scotch bonnet jam or the slow braised kid goat belly with radish and tarragon. Alongside the Caribbean influences, Cochrane playfully works in touches from all over. Hake comes with cod’s roe, XO sauce and nori and a sweetcorn dish is flavoured with miso (1251.co.uk). The big must-have bakery good this Christmas? It’s the Terry’s Chocolate Orange muffin from Costa, which the coffee shop chain says has been selling at the rate of six a second. Each muffin comes topped with a chocolate orange segment. Apparently, Terry’s was unable to supply individual segments so the company making the muffins has had to buy in, tap and unwrap tens of thousands of chocolate oranges by hand. Self-described ‘healthy’ fast food chain Leon, is to open two more sites at Motorway services on both the M40 at Beaconsfield and the M25 at Cobham. Meanwhile it has trademarked the phrase ‘Just Happens To Be Vegan’ after the success of its aquafaba based ‘mayonnaise’ supermarket range.

This now mini-chain positions itself as a Korean gogi gui grill spot, where diners cook their own meat on giant hotplates built into the tables. But Yori’s clientele of young, pretty, often Korean kids don’t stick to that, because there are also a lot of goon man du dumplings, bibimbab, ramen and corn cheese happening. I’m yet to solve the mystery of Korean corn cheese, which is basically tinned sweetcorn, sugar and mayo baked with a generous handful of mozzarella. Someone told me it’s a play on Mexican elote via Koreans in Los Angeles, another said it was once a popular Japanese sushi side dish, while others still say it’s just testament to the fact that Koreans, like the Brits, have a wickedly sweet tooth. That would, at least, explain peach soju wine: if I was being full Jilly Goolden, the one that Yori serves is definitely redolent of icepops and Lambrini blush. Still, even the idea of Yori’s pajeon (spring onion pancake) helped me through at least 80 days of incarceration. I got as far as mail-ordering corn starch before accepting that eating pajeon surrounded only by cats, rather than framed photos of indie pop stars such as Hyukoh and actors Ha Jung-woo and Jung Woo-sung, just wouldn’t be the same. Of course, now that I’m free to roam around London, I worry that nothing will ever be the same again. At 8pm on a Thursday, we set off to Yori’s new Covent Garden branch along streets so deserted, you could hear urban seagulls cawing on rooftops as we traipsed along rows of boarded-up shops, closed pubs and restaurants. It is tempting to look at those strategically taken photographs of bustling Soho nightlife and believe that London has bounced back brassily. This really is baloney. There are pockets of buzz, true, but midweek, from Holborn to Drury Lane, the lights are off. Some good news: last week, the likes of Darby’s, Quo Vadis, Dishoom and Tonkotsu dusted themselves off and stood upright again. But the bits in between are still hazy. Cities without nightlife are disorienting. “We need to turn right at Balthazar – it’s next to The Play That Goes Wrong,” but both were closed, so my internal GPS went askew. Yori Covent Garden is a fine example of the challenges small restaurants are facing. The waiter and I greet each other masked, and neither of us can hear the other. He’s pointing at a QR code, wanting my home address, and gesturing at a big bottle of vicious-looking hand sanitiser. “No barbecue tables,” he muffles. “Not a problem,” I muffle back. We’re led to a small, scrubbed upstairs table featuring another huge bottle of hand sanitiser. The menu must now be accessed and ordered by QR code, but this part of the restaurant is a 4G dead spot. Serving staff across the country must be thoroughly exhausted by trying to make this situation jolly. Yori’s spring onion pancake, although still spongey-centred and crisp in all the right places, is now half its original size, the once delicately battered Korean fried chicken arrives as a fearsome plate of spherical balls, and the shredded beef bulgogi is so lacking in its usual bold, caramelised, sweet pear, soy depth that it felt almost as if it had been spooned from a tin. We share a good, spicy-as-heck shrimp and calamari jeongol stew and range through sides of kimchi-laced bokum bab fried rice with an icy-cold mool naeng myun – buckwheat noodles in beef stock with radish. Yori feels slightly more slapdash than it did in the old days, a bit like a boxer finding their feet again, but I’m grateful they made me dinner. Nothing is perfect anywhere right now, but at least hobs are on and front doors are open. This is only the start. • Yori Covent Garden, 15 Catherine Street, London WC2, 020-7836 3145.

When all this blows over, my friends and I agreed, we’ll go to Pizza Express. Midweek, table for four, Sloppy Giuseppes, numerous warm bottles of Gavi di Gavi. We’ll laugh about this one day, we said, weakly, as the chat flickered between closed schools, locked-down care homes, skipped chemo and the loneliness of isolation. It was never really about the doughballs; they represented a former carefree life. When every restaurant in Britain closed, from high street to haute cuisine, many of us suddenly saw what eating together gives us. This was true even for me, someone who eats out for a living, and who in the first few weeks enjoyed the break. But there’s a joy and a rhythm in sitting with others, sipping, nibbling and laughing – one you’ll never get from an ever-flickering chat app. Eating together is where actual life happens. Miles away from my family, I missed desperately the way my brother David side-orders jalapeños on everything and refuses to share pudding. I missed stabbing away at his sticky toffee pudding with a spoon, quacking, “You’re worse now than when you were a child!” because we’ve done this for more than 40 years. I longed to sit in peaceable silence with my teenage niece, Lola, as she ogles TikTok from behind a McNugget box. If restaurants could just reopen, I thought, the world would feel sane again. But then they did, and for the first few meals I felt worse. Six weeks later, here’s what I’ve learned. 1 Put your first meals down to experience Obviously, the problem with the doughballs dream was that it was exactly that: a snapshot of a former life, one that no longer exists. My first trips out felt more like fact-finding missions with added yaki udon. Perhaps yours will, too. Perhaps you’ll puzzle at the roped-off doors at Wagamama and sigh as the hand sanitation units squirt foam on your shoes. Or feel slightly blue when the Pret a Manger staff need a QR code and your details before selling you a falafel salad from the limited menu rather than the chia porridge you wanted. “Nothing,” I heard myself cry, melodramatically, “Nothing in this godforsaken country seems to be working properly.” Yes, I was still talking about porridge. It took Covid-19 for me to notice how very spoiled I was by these big, slick always-open chains. On an excited trip to my local Rosa’s Thai Cafe last week, which Google claimed brightly was definitely serving, the lights were off and the kitchen was shut. Reliable brands behaving weirdly is oddly unsettling. It wasn’t just about tofu massaman; it simply felt like Britain was malfunctioning. 2 Accept that meeting people is no longer easy Even eating with close friends will feel strangely awry at first attempt; depressing, even. Those dreams I had back in April of a big reunion – which eventually took place at a French brasserie – did not include being scanned with temperature guns, downloading apps to order or one-way systems around floors. They did not feature the ever-present under-table rustle of hand sanitiser bottles as first one person, then the next, succumbs, until a domino effect of germophobia takes over. Or how jarring it is saying farewell to very old friends, after wine, with your arms clamped flatly to your sides and a stilted, old-school British “Cheerio, then”, before going home in a cab where the driver has clingfilmed himself into a safety pod. I returned home stuffed with celeriac remoulade and pithivier, draped in a light cloak of disquiet, and didn’t feel like getting out of bed the next day. Not ideal for a restaurant critic. 3 Understand that there are no rules for sharing Ten dinners later, I’m more into the groove. I’ve stopped squirting anti-bac foam on my ballet pumps and I can emote happy, sad and “can I get the bill” in a face mask. I have a reliable QR app to access menus and using it feels breezy. In Tonkotsu, a ramen chain, for example, the staff seat you and bring food, but you use your phone to order and pay. Wagamama is the same. Before setting off anywhere now, I telephone to hear a human voice saying they will be open. Kitchens are working on a skeleton staff, and anything can happen. When the owner tweeted tomorrow’s opening hours at 11pm, he didn’t plan for his entire staff self-isolating. Eating with other people, I find even less predictable. It’s tricky. How do people feel about sharing a plate of calamari nowadays? My fork touching your plate? How about tapas in general? Or any communal picking? With friends, you can bash these things out. But I’ve also found that fellow diners’ firmly held views can shift at random when faced with something delicious. I’ve seen the most terrified companions order their own kari and paratha, to keep sagely at their end of the table, before finishing off everyone else’s lentils and bhuna with a spoon. Be kind with each other’s contradictions. We’re all scared in different ways. We’re all still learning. 4 Be grateful Gratitude. I finally saw why Oprah swears it will change your life. After London, I did Bristol, then Sussex, staying in eerie half-open hotels, wasting whole weekends on wild goose chases to shuttered-up restaurants. Sundays and Mondays are a write-off: almost nowhere is cooking. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are tricky, too. Hopefully the Eat Out To Help Out scheme will give owners more impetus to switch on the stoves, if further lockdowns don’t frighten people away. In the current state we’re in, I’ve begun to see every open sign and welcoming smile as a minor miracle. Every dish plated up in Britain this weekend is hewn from the chef’s heroism and sheer bloody-mindedness. Four months ago, these businesses were forced to close overnight; their tight units of chefs, front-of-house folk and porters were sent home; their regular supply chains broken; their profits and savings demolished. While landlords across the UK demanded payments, the government stumbled over plans to permit reopening. As the cheery-sounding “Super Saturday” was finally announced, potential customers were squabbling day and night on social media about the morality of eating out at all. Any restaurateur who fought to decipher Whitehall’s voluminous tome of non-specific guidelines and began serving pancakes again deserves credit. By removing tables to be safe, they have removed further profits. So, yes, there’s a good chance they might not have the bavette steak on the trimmed menu, and service is slow as the manager is also now washing dishes, but be grateful. We are all having a slightly rubbish time. These people work in hospitality, so it’s literally their job to hide it. 5 Pay your deposit Have you been asked for a sum upfront for dinner? Stop sulking and pay. Restaurants, once upon a time, used to trust us. But too many people behaved badly and this is why we can’t have nice things. One small positive about dining after Covid-19 might be a new tendency to stick to plans, and stop being flaky. The old restaurant landscape instilled in us all a sense of abundance filled with new openings, uncharted cuisines and novel concepts. The rise of faceless reservation apps allowed people to double-book, hedge their bets and, if it was raining, not bother leaving the house at all. After all, it wasn’t as if you were letting down an actual human being. Except we were, every single time. Now the hospitality world is punch-drunk and cannot afford to let staff twiddle their thumbs because you and your gang decided last minute against spaghetti. Don’t be the person who takes to TripAdvisor to give a one-star review when you lose your deposit. Satan has a special private dining room in hell for you. 6 Expect the unexpected Once you have learned the ropes of eating out in a pandemic, there’s an odd sense of freedom. Saturday night tables are gloriously available, restaurants feel roomy and welcomes are extra warm. Nothing is predictable, though. I arrived at an intimate bistro in Bristol and ended up being escorted to a small church forecourt to eat under a tarpaulin. I checked into a fancy hotel in Kent that boasts of an exquisite wine list to find the bar shut due to restrictions; we were sheepishly ushered to the local pub, which was more like a Wetherspoons (we had a terrific night). In one place, the kitchen was only serving from 6-8pm, so their remaining chef could pop home and put her kids to bed. We’d eaten pudding and were back in time for Emmerdale. In an extra-chic cocktail bar the other day, the staff wore designer peach silk face masks that coordinated gorgeously with their uniforms, but unfortunately fitted terribly, so they blew about every time they spoke, making their faces look like the Gatwick airport windsock. Nothing works normally any more, but many of us can meet some of the people we love, see the whites of their eyes and bond in a very British way: by ordering pizza and taking the mickey out of each other. I have tasted freedom and after at least 15 attempts, I give it five stars.','https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/aug/22/grace-dents-guide-to-post-lockdown-eating-out-i-can-now-emote-happy-sad-and-can-i-get-the-bill-in-a-face-mask','Grace Dent','Grace Dent''s guide to post-lockdown eating out',-2.45438910000000021,54.2776946999999907,0.526699999999999946);

Starters £3-£4; mains £7-£13; desserts £3; unlicensed There are a few people, some of whom may have a little too much time on their hands, who have claimed on social media that they can track my reviewing around the country against my various gigs and shows. Specifically, they have said, you need only compare the restaurants I write about to the locations for episodes of Radio 4’s Kitchen Cabinet, the intoxicatingly marvellous, award-winning, culturally significant, cheese and bacon-perving, deep fat fryer-promoting food panel show I chair for the BBC. I like to imagine them with maps and different coloured pins, punching the air as the holes for those pins coincide. Innocent as charged. It makes complete sense for me to do this. We do not choose all the locations for Kitchen Cabinet episodes because they have obvious food connections and stories, although some obviously do. Because we produce 26 episodes a year, we go everywhere, from the tip of Cornwall to the Highlands. Often, we go to places that don’t get their fair share of attention and may not seem immediately to be a beacon for the belly-led. But we work on the basis that if we look closely enough, we will always find a great food-related story that needs to be told. I apply a similar policy to the restaurants I visit. I don’t always have to go somewhere based on the restaurant I’ve chosen. Sometimes it’s the other way around: I go to a restaurant because of where I happen to be at the time. I won’t lie. When I started doing this job 20 years ago, that would likely have ended up with me in a chain pub eating a steak from a cow that died of a bacterial infection. But times have changed. With research I can usually find the good stuff. I regard it as part of my job. It’s why – cue the trumpets – I’m one of the few national critics in recent years to have reviewed from Doncaster or Llandudno or Blackpool. I say few; I’m certain I can claim “only”. Go me. It’s a tawdry sort of a boast. Us national newspaper journalists can fairly be accused of not getting off the beaten track often enough. We shouldn’t expect plaudits when we do. But it does explain the happy choice this week, of the polished gem that is Persian Cottage in Middlesbrough. It’s a brightly lit, wood-floored space just beyond the town centre, where the ornate tablecloths come plastic-covered for a quick wipe down. That evening we had recorded a fine show. We had conducted a detailed interrogation of the breaded chicken-and-cheese drunk-food wonder that is the parmo, to the dismay of some locals who didn’t want the city known only for that, and the utter delight of others. Now we needed dinner. I took a punt based on a long-held but quietly kept belief: you will rarely eat badly in a Middle Eastern grill house. Even the mediocre ones are good. Which means that the good ones, like Persian Cottage, are cracking. The basic proposition – meats grilled over charcoal, rugged dips and salads – hides huge regional variations. At Persian Cottage that regional variation starts with the rice. I try to avoid hyperbole, but sod it: Persian rice is the best way with rice. It is the rice of your dreams, if your dreams involve rice, which sometimes they should do. It is light and fluffy and every grain is separate so that even with the traditional application of a little butter – foil wrapped pats are provided here for a bit of self-mixing – it never turns into some bolus of carbs. It is a wonder of the culinary world. I wanted to know how it’s done, so I turned to the great Sabrina Ghayour and her book Persiana. Apparently, it’s a two-stage process. First the rice must be parboiled and rinsed to shift the starch. Then it must be steamed. It sounds like a faff, but it’s a worthwhile faff. Here we have it both with the woozy aromatics of saffron, and “green” with handfuls of fresh herbs. It accompanies a groaning mixed grill of kebabs, still smoking lightly from the charcoal. Chunks of lamb come fiercely flamed until dark and singed. There are cuts of still-soft chicken stained yellow by its marinade. There are undulating planks of spiced minced lamb, ready to leak their juices into the rice. We have a plate of lamb chops, lined up in serried ranks, the fat crisped to within an inch of decency. Do not trust anyone who attempts to eat these with anything but their hands. Bone-in lamb chops are food with a handle. We have a whole grilled chicken, its skin blistered from the heat. From a list of stews, we have fesenjan, a night-dark dish of chicken braised in a rugged sweet-and-sour sauce of blitzed walnuts and pomegranate paste. Aubergine comes in two different ways. There’s the deep green of kashk e bademjan, for which it’s fried until falling apart then mashed with walnuts, mint and whey, so that it’s vibrating with acidity and vigour. By contrast, in mirza ghasemi, the aubergine is grilled, then beaten with garlic, tomato and crushed pieces of boiled egg, and a motherload of fried onions. It’s altogether deeper and darker. Naturally we have hummus, the lightest of takes courtesy of a ballast of tahini, and a classic fattoush of cracked wheat and flatleaf parsley and lemon. We scoop it all up with warm pieces of flat bread fresh from the oven and conclude we’re being good to ourselves. We hope for pastries at the end but instead get a chocolate gateau and pomegranate cheesecake, both of which seem more box- rather than kitchen-fresh. They’ll do. They do not serve alcohol, but have no objection to you drinking. There are a couple of off-licences within a few minutes’ walk and Persian Cottage will supply wine glasses, corkscrews and bottle openers. As a result, the bill for eight of us stays low. Our most expensive order is the mixed grill at £25, but it’s built to feed two. The aubergine dishes are £4 each; the whole chicken, a tenner. None of this will come as a surprise to the people of Middlesbrough. A year ago, Persian Cottage topped the rankings of a restaurant review site which I won’t name because it will only encourage them. The local paper took this as its cue to publish the whole menu. It read like found poetry. That, people, is the definition of service journalism. News bites A trip to Green Lanes, the heart of London’s Turkish community, leads to more serious flame-grilled meat action at the landmark that is Gökyüzü. Take a friend and try the Full Platter: a heap of rice and bulgur wheat layered with lamb and chicken shish, adana kebab, lamb ribs, chicken wings and both chicken and lamb doner. Then ask to take what you haven’t finished, home. Treat this with as much seriousness as you wish: Tesco’s second annual report on our festive eating habits reveals the shocking news that Christmas pudding has seen a 20% surge in popularity from last year. A whacking 48% of the population say they will now be eating it on Christmas Day, up from 40% last year. The pudding love is not evenly spread, with Bristol being the epicentre. Over 60% of the city’s population says they’ll be having one this year. Disturbing news: according to a recent survey by software company Fourth, one in six employees in the hospitality industry say they have received no regular training on issues around allergens in foods. 73% of diners said they had not been asked about any allergies during their most recent trip to a restaurant.

Snacks/starters £4-£9, mains £16-£21, desserts £6-£7, set menu £20, wines from £24 Every few days Sam Sifton, a former restaurant critic for the New York Times and now one of that newspaper’s most senior editors, emails out a newsletter full of cheery cooking tips and recipe ideas. The tone of a recent instalment suggests that Sifton, a quietly urbane man with the air of someone who has seen quite enough of everything thank you very much, is starting to lose it. After an impeccably polite “Good morning” he went on to detail the woes bedevilling his country: the fires across the American west, the rising unemployment, the crash and grind of political tensions, the scourge of systemic racism, the growing pestilence of social isolation that “has led to increases in overdoses, to declines in mental health, to loneliness so intense as to be personified”. That was paragraph one. Paragraph two started: “And I’m here to sell you on a pan-fried eggplant with chilli, honey and ricotta?” The sweet tone of bafflement is understood. Are we really going to be celebrating such small things, when there are so many huge calamities pressing themselves against our front doors, trying to get in? If existential threat had a smell, the air would be stinking right now. His conclusion: yes we are, for it is the small things we must cling to in times like these. As someone who labours in the same fields as Sifton, I can only say: “Amen, brother!” We must take our pleasures where we may. We must celebrate the everyday. Townsend, a restaurant located inside the Whitechapel Gallery in London’s East End, is one of those pleasures. This may read like faint praise. It’s the opposite. No, it’s not the sort of restaurant to make you swoon at inventiveness, or dazzle you with shiny ideas. It’s a place where you go with a friend so as to get lost in the chatter, only then to clock just how well you are being fed; just how much good taste and care is being brought to bear on such good ingredients. It’s all there in the restaurant’s DNA. The head chef is Joe Fox, who used to run the kitchen at Petersham Nurseries, long lauded for the way it priorities flavour over prissy presentation. He was recruited by Nick Gilkinson, who has previously worked at the bistro Anglo and, more significantly, the delightful café at the Garden Museum by Lambeth Bridge. Like the latter, this feels like a dining room designed to keep the world at bay. It’s panelled in honey-coloured wood and rimmed with banquettes upholstered in leather the shade of the best milk chocolate. The midcentury-modern tables and chairs are reassuringly spaced. It’s a sweet, warm contrast to the cold, hard stone of the Whitechapel Gallery within which it is housed (designed by Charles Harrison Townsend from whom the name is taken). Outside, traffic thunders by on the Whitechapel Road, as if making its escape. In here, all is right with the world. From the snacks list we have croquettes of Devon blue cheese, their crisp, deep-fried shells giving way to a semi-liquid centre of stinky loveliness. They perch on a puddle of fermented chilli sauce, a rough-hewn, homemade version of sriracha with a vitality and freshness that doesn’t come from a plastic bottle. It’s an edible bugle call right in the lugholes. Wake up. Lunch is here. There are four starters and four mains, some of which read as little more than assemblies of great ingredients. Take quail’s eggs, treacle-cured trout and purple sprouting broccoli. Go on. Take them. You know you want to. The eggs are soft boiled so the doll’s house yolks lubricate the plate. The folds of lightly cured trout have been brought to room temperature. There is a dribble of vinaigrette across the broccoli. You fork it away as you talk and soon realise, looking down at the very last scraps, that you’ll miss it when it’s gone. The same is true of a salad of soft-roasted, spiced aubergine, which has been removed from its skin and cubed, with roasted peppers and a snowfall of rowdy Ticklemore cheese. Is it a looker? Not especially. It’s a masterclass in the virtues of beige. But then it’s not for looking at. It’s for eating. From the mains there is a plate of Mayan potatoes, prepared in the way that is becoming so familiar in London right now that I suspect you have to get permission to not do them this way: they are sliced, baked, pressed and chilled, then deep-fried to create a slab of something golden and striated with echoing shelves of crunch. This potato raft – we all need a potato raft in our lives – is piled with crisped wild mushrooms, surrounding a soft egg yolk. Over the top is finely grated parmesan, curls of black truffle and more chipsticks of fried potato. What a terrific mess the kitchen has made for £16. A couple of quid more brings an impeccable pork chop, with roasted squash, brown butter, hazelnuts and sage leaves. We have dressed tomatoes on the side for a blush of colour. There is a short wine list which appears to want to sell us wine rather than ideology. We have a glass each because it’s lunchtime and work beckons, but there is still time for dessert: a soft baked cheesecake, with sweet plums of the deepest purple roasted with thyme; and a deep-filled treacle tart, which kitchens seem to love making at the moment. Fine by me. With unfortunate timing they opened in February, only to close almost immediately. They turned their website into an online shop, offering not just recipe boxes but a range of quality produce via their supplier, Natoora, as well as their own items, like that fermented chilli sauce. The shop is still open and, since mid-July, the restaurant is back, too. Come here and let them feed you. Alongside the à la carte, they do breakfast, and a set menu at £20 for three courses. Will any of this banish the sort of things Sam Sifton of the New York Times howled about in his newsletter? No, of course not. Deep-fried Mayan potatoes or an expertly roasted aubergine are marvellous, but they’re not miracle cures. However, what they can do is fix you in the present tense and, by holding you there, cheer you up. If anybody asks you what the point of a restaurant like Townsend is right now, tell them it is this: to make things just that little bit better. News bites Claims by the restaurant business that the Covid-19 restrictions – first the rule of six, then the 10pm curfew, now the non-mixing of households – are not justified by the low transmission rates within those restaurant, have received a boost by the findings of a new survey from industry body UK Hospitality. The survey of over 12,500 venues for the 14 weeks since reopening found they had been notified of just 780 cases among customers, out of 250 million guest visits. That’s a rate of .0003%. Zak Jones, who owned both the Chancery in London’s Holborn and the Clerkenwell Dining Room, is to launch a major project in 2021 in Ilkley, West Yorkshire. Moss and Moor will be a 230-seat venue as part of a large garden centre, and will create about 30 jobs. The café will open seven days a week for breakfast, lunch and afternoon tea and will sit alongside a food hall. And further developments in the restaurant meal kit delivery sector, with the arrival of Restokit. The service launches with a set of London restaurants including Nieves Barragán’s Spanish restaurant Sabor, French restaurant Galvin La Chapelle, the Sri Lankan Kolamba and the Indian Brigadiers, before rolling out nationwide (restokit.co.uk).

Littlefrench in Westbury Park – it’s little, it’s French – has no control over the weather, of course, and I’m just ecstatic to see the place open in whatever form. Reports of the restaurant scene creeping back to anything remotely normal are vastly exaggerated. In my bio-pic, summer 2020 will be a montage of my forlorn face on many, many wild goose chases, closed signs, dashed hopes and a closing shot in which I snivel and eat an M&amp;S nutty salad on a random doorstep. Don’t set off anywhere until you’ve heard a voice on a phone confirming that human life is present; but then, if they’re open, they’ll probably be busy, stressed out and unable to answer the phone. The struggle and disappointment, however – and, yes, I am still being a restaurant critic – makes moments like dinner at Littlefrench all the more glorious. Even if we aren’t allowed into the pretty, elegant restaurant itself, because the stipulations of re-opening require a one-way system and a hand-sanitisation unit, which has meant Freddy and Nessa Bird have set up shop round the back. Such concerns are all smoothed over by good hospitality, and there’s that in heaps at Littlefrench, where they put things right with a French 75 (gin, champagne, lemon juice) and a prettily plated volley of fat roast queen scallops, presented in their shells and swimming in a heroically good sauternes butter. “This is why people come out to eat, despite everything,” I said to Charles as those scallops arrived. We were surrounded by stoic diners wearing walking jackets over going-out garb and sipping boulevardiers that transformed Bristol into Biarritz via the power of deftly mixed booze. We’d started with a plate of excellent, crisp, peppery radishes, which I ate like a half-starved Flemish Giant rabbit. The Provençal-style anchoïade dip that came with them was exactly as it should be: a gloriously brutal blend of white-wine vinegar, olive oil, anchovies and garlic. Then fresh goat’s curd with just-podded and barely even blanched peas and a pile of confit’d new-season garlic on toasted sourdough. Littlefrench brims with a sense of largesse that I’ve not felt for months. Rare onglet arrives in a red wine jus packed with melted shallots and alongside a gargantuan heap of crisp, salty fries: this is steak frîtes elevated way past pub grub level. Then a whole turbot, a fearsome challenge, with tartare hollandaise and soft, buttered Cornish earlies spuds with wilted spinach. I cheered to see my favourite side on the menu – green beans with hazelnuts – which will forever remind me of Little Owl in Manhattan, which I’m chuffed to see is also upright again and keeping on keeping on. I’d arrived at Littlefrench rather hungry, having left London in a rush and there being no catering on the train, no open coffee shop at Temple Meads station, no biscuits with the hotel tea, no room service, a long queue outside the nearby Co-op, and so on and so forth. Tiny, mundane, ever-present hiccups in normal life mean you never quite forget this is where we are now; things are not the same, and perhaps they never will be again. Abundance and the luxury of everything-right-now has halted and been replaced by a long search for a working public loo and being overjoyed when they turn on the latte machine at WHSmith. I shall therefore remember that, after a very famished day, Littlefrench served me a prune and armagnac tart with which I ordered a glass of Cornish Mena Hweg sweet wine, kicked off my heels under the table and felt very grateful indeed. It was more cake than tart, because to my mind a tart is streamlined and even abstemious, whereas this was laden with chewy, tipsy prunes, would have fed three Gallic sailors, and came swimming in a heavenly, drunken crème anglaise. That’s just posh for custard, true, but if you call it crème anglaise, it means you can drink it from a jug out of the fridge and feel like Juliette Binoche. Littlefrench is a similar joy. It didn’t plan to be an open-air canteen operating in a downpour, but honestly, ça ne fait rien. • littlefrench 2 North View, Westbury Park, Bristol BS6, 0117 970 6276.

Starters £8.50-£13; mains £18-£25; desserts £5.50-£7.50; wines from £27 Eating a whole piglet is like staging an orgy; you need more than two people to get the job done. The problem is that, when I review a restaurant there are only ever two of us, and that makes both propositions very tricky. Admittedly the latter is rarely on the menu during restaurant visits; neither of us is likely to be orgy fit. But at Sarap Bistro the former most certainly was an option, and I was at least four people short of a piglet party. Sarap belongs to the chef Ferdinand “Budgie” Montoya, and is part of his ongoing exploration of the food of the Philippines, where he was born. Key to that is the famed lechon: roast piglet, with golden, shattering skin and the tenderest, sweetest of meat. (If you are a meat eater with a taste for lamb, but still want to be absolutely livid about the consumption of young pigs, muster your arguments now.) Here, the lechon comes stuffed with lemongrass and truffled adobo rice. Sounds great doesn’t it. There’s only one problem: you have to order a whole damn piglet two days in advance, and muster a party of six to eight people to do the eating. It costs £295. About 10 minutes after we arrive there is a cheer from the far end of the dimly lit dining room. A small crowd is gathered, cameraphones aloft. I wander down to find them recording the portioning up of their piglet, plumes of steam rising from the chopping board as Montoya works the cleaver over the meat. The legs go one way, the snout another. I take a few pictures, but end up feeling like an interloper at the celebration of a stranger’s birthday. I am not friends with these people. I cannot share their piglet. Well, in truth, I probably could have done if I’d asked nicely. I could have told them I was Grace Dent and they’d instantly have told me to fill my boots. I can rock a leopard-print wrap dress, me. The point is that, the most diverting item on the menu here at Sarap (which means delicious) is the one I can’t order. Still, there are a bunch of other things available and by the end of the night, following the beguiling instructions of our waiter, I will have tried all but one of them. Montoya has been on a long and twisting journey to get here, both figuratively and literally. He only started cooking professionally when he arrived in the UK in 2012 from Australia. He worked at Restaurant Story, Foley’s and the Dean Street Townhouse, while all the time nurturing a desire to interrogate his family’s favourite dishes. It began with a supper club which led in turn to various pop ups, and then a casual place in Brixton Market. Now he has taken over this spot on Heddon Street, which has become a bit of an incubator for new restaurant ventures; previously, it was home to the rugged nose-to-tail Italian Manteca, which has moved on to Shoreditch. Montoya describes what he is doing here as delivering authentic flavours “proudly inauthentically”, a thoroughly engaging term I first came across in chef Ravinder Bhogal’s Jikoni cookbook. It’s a short menu. Our enthusiastic waiter tells us we should order three starters between the two of us. There are only three starters. The food here strikes me as a softer, often warmer version of the sharp, sweet and salty flavours I am used to from elsewhere in southeast Asia. Pearly pieces of seabass are cured in a soft sour coconut vinegar. There is a gel made from calamansi, or Philippine lemon, and for crunch there are pieces of cucumber. It’s all bright and refreshing. In the mellifluously named Ensaladang Talong it is the addition of crumbled salted duck egg which shifts a rough smoked aubergine purée and slices of tomato away from the Mediterranean. But the most compelling dish, because it nods towards the lechon, is a boned out, rice-stuffed pig’s trotter, with skin that is hinged in a remarkable place between crisp and chewy. It feels a little like a consolation prize for not being able to give the piglet a seeing to. It’s a good consolation prize. There are four main courses. We are told we should order three. The most diverting are the hunks of roasted celeriac in a ripe, creamy peanut sauce, with the lightest waft of truffle. Poussin has been marinated in lemongrass, citrus and vinegar before being grilled over charcoal to produce the kind of savoury blackened skin which gives point to these small, often flavourless birds. Finally, there are rosy slices of beef, in a thick citrus and soy sauce. It’s very good beef indeed, though the £25 charged for four less-than-vast slices is ambitious. (Amusingly, they plated six slices of the beef for the dish prepared for the photographer who visited a few days later.) Still, we have a bowl of rice with which to absorb the gorgeous liquor. These are I think, all meant to be showstoppers. Intriguingly, the most thrilling dish is actually a simple side of kale braised for hours in coconut milk, ginger, garlic and chilli. It is both comforting and a wake up; an intense, rich vegan stew which I wanted to lean over and focus on. At £6 it also feels like the best moment of value on the menu, for we are just off Regent Street and that is rarely a cheap place in which to be. I am amused by what feels like blatant upselling by our waiter at the start, however encouragingly done. It does mean the bill mounts. Then again, we do not finish up over fed. Desserts are solid and sustaining rather than light and refreshing: a mildly rubbery cassava cheesecake with coconut milk; a log of sweetened glutinous rice with a coconut caramel. Those aside, I like Sarap Bistro very much. The food is unfamiliar in a good way and the execution is precise. It just seems unfortunate that lechon which, for good or ill, is the Philippine’s most famous dish, is not available to individual punters. Without a way to access that roast piglet it makes the experience feel a little like the culinary equivalent of Hamlet without the prince, or Jaws without the shark. Or maybe it’s just that it forces me to confront the fact that I don’t have enough friends; or at least not the kind of friends happy to help me demolish a piglet.

Small plates £2.50-£9, main dishes £12.50-£17.50, desserts £7, wines from £21 Many years ago, I was a regular carol singer around the streets of Crouch End in north London, which was an odd pre-Christmas night out for an atheist Jew. Then again, very few of those in our group had much interest in the baby Jesus. We just liked the tunes and the potential for fundraising. From these repeated trips I learned two things about Crouch End. The first is that, compared to many other parts of London, it’s a right pain in the arse to get to. Tube and train lines have no desire to go anywhere near it, which means it’s a bus ride or nothing. And secondly, well-heeled Crouch Enders like it this way. They’re generally well dragged up, so try not to sound too smug about it, but will still tell you about the village feel and the sense of community, and have you tried the sourdough from the new place just past Waitrose? Recently a Crouch Ender launched a crowd-funder for a thrilling new sourdough project. There’s already a lot of sourdough in Crouch End, she said. It just isn’t very good sourdough. It’s that sort of place. All of this has an impact on the restaurants that thrive there. They are what we sometimes casually dismiss as neighbourhood places. They are the ones you go to at the last minute because you can’t be fagged to cook, or because you need a debrief with your pals over a few bottles of New Zealand’s finest. There’s the French bistro and the Greek taverna and the pizza joints (sourdough crusts up the wazoo). If all of this sounds grossly privileged, well of course it bloody is. In the most unflashy of ways. It’s Crouch End. The site occupied by Lyon’s Seafood and Wine Bar has been many things over the years. The white tiling behind the bar, with its old-school jade green and floral edging, hints at a past as a butcher’s. Our waiter thinks it may also have served as one of those pre-supermarket branches of Sainsbury’s with counter service. And then of course, it was a series of neighbourhood restaurants. This latest incarnation could be mistaken for more of the same: a great local standby. Obviously, you could pop in for a quick something to eat. They’d be pleased to see you. But there is rather more going on here. The owner, Anthony Lyon, comes with time at Hix, the Wolseley and Colbert on the clock. When it opened a year ago, the head chef was Talia Prince, who had worked at the Fat Duck and Le Gavroche (though she has recently moved on). The proposition: “Fin-to-tail seafood and small-batch wines”. It lives up to that. One main is a plate of salmon collars, that bit at the back of the head just behind the gills, which has lots of good flesh if you’re willing to get stuck in. Fancier kitchens might take them home for the cat. Here, they are tandoori paste-rubbed, then roasted until the skin is crisp, and the oily, pink flesh beneath is falling away. It comes on a bed of spiced coconut quinoa with, on the side, a pot of their own quite spectacular mango chutney, full of intriguing depths and corners. The dish costs £12.50. You can roll your eyes at a restaurant flogging what might once have been scraps, or recognise the war on waste and the work that’s gone into making it something much more than itself. I’m in the latter camp. Early on we have a couple of their dressed rock oysters. One comes with the crunch and vigour of pickled cucumber and a dollop of dill mayo; another, with taramasalata and a scoop of caviar. It’s the oceanic version of denim on denim, but in a good way. The nearest thing to straightforward are three tiger prawns, grilled in chilli and garlic-spiked butter. Head suckage is mandatory. Or you could get some of their sourdough. Well of course. There really would be a mob outside with pitchforks and burning stakes if they didn’t offer sourdough. Both of the smaller plates I try are strikingly precise. They feel like two courses in search of a tasting menu. A small piece of warmed smoked eel sits on a golden tangle of slow-cooked Lyonnaise onions. On the top are the thinnest slices of green apples, laid across each other like scales. A warm, limpid oniony broth is poured all around. It’s only a couple of mouthfuls but they are two spectacular mouthfuls. On another plate are thick pieces of salmon, cured in doom-black nori, then pressed together. They are laid on a punchy wasabi cream and dressed with slices of radish and crisped skin. Our other main is two soft-shell crabs, thickly battered, deep-fried and laid on a bold mess of turnip and kimchi – a Korean dish called kkakdugi – which keeps all that rich, deep-fried shellfish in line. All these dishes are properly worth our time, money and attention, though the menu does lack balance. There’s the offer of a whole grilled seabass for two at £35, which apparently comes with a bit of foliage. The nearest thing to a side dish is a bowl of padrón peppers, a miso-grilled aubergine or a take on hash browns, engineered as Jenga bricks. It’s all mostly brown. A salad wouldn’t go amiss. Dessert is just creamy things set in bowls earlier in the day so they could get on with the rest of the prep: a fair enough lemon posset or a sturdy chocolate mousse with a bit of honeycomb and dulce de leche. Their heart really isn’t in it. Still, the wine offering really is as diverting as they promise, with a selection of bottles I had never heard of and had to ask many questions about. Our first waiter puts her hands up admirably, says it’s her first day, and sends over the friendly chap who knows everything. We end up with a txakoli, a crisp white from the Basque country – a name spelt with an “x” like that is always a giveaway – which makes me feel travelled and adventurous. During lockdown Lyon’s restyled itself as an online store, selling great produce. At the time of writing, the garbled website hasn’t recovered from that. But the restaurant is very much back, in a moody, globe-lit, wood-floored dining room built for social distancing. The locals of Crouch End have an intriguing thing on their doorstep. The rest of us should consider getting on the bus. Newsbites The Korean British Cultural Exchange, a charity promoting Korean culture in the UK, has launched a new kimchi recipe book, featuring contributions from members of the North and South Korean and Korean-Chinese communities in the London Borough of Kingston. The recipe book comes ahead of the Kimjang Festival, celebrating all things kimchi and being held online from 18 November. For more info visit kimjangproject.com.

Two courses £20, three courses £26, five-course tasting menu £35, wines from £29 In the beginning there was a wild mushroom risotto and the non-meat eaters looked upon it and saw that it was seriously lame. Really? Is that it? For many kitchens cooking in the European tradition, it was. Going back 20 years or so it often seemed that, without a lump of animal protein to put front and centre, many lazy cooks would fall back swiftly into the heavy embrace of the carbs. Those damn vegetarians and vegans might not get something imaginative, but at least they’d get fed. Bring on the rice and pasta. Or, if you’re really lucky, a vegetable gratin that could grout a bathroom. A lot has changed. A lot hasn’t. As recently as February this year, at the splashy new restaurant of a chef who not only should know better but generally does, the meat-free options were pasta to start and gnocchi for the main. The come-hither menu descriptions listed roasted pumpkin and amaretto biscuits, pickled Thai shallots and dukkah. But none of that disguised those dishes’ true nature: pasta and gnocchi. There has, of course, been innovation. All hail Ottolenghi. Likewise, new generations of cooks have arrived in waves, fully aware that the diverse traditions of the Indian subcontinent, of China and the Middle East and all points in between often get along just fine without reaching for an ingredient that once had a pulse. Give thanks, too, for the rich blessing that is miso; for the uncompromising heft of gochujang. And yet, what occurs to me early on in my terrific lunch at Land, a small restaurant tucked away in the sort of Victorian shopping arcade in Birmingham that Pevsner wrote about, is how many clichés are still present in non-meat cookery in so many British restaurants. And how many of them are completely absent here. In your service I have been living through the cauliflower years. I have survived the aubergine years. Fine, sturdy vegetables, both. Love a bit of roasted cauliflower, me. I haven’t met an aubergine that I couldn’t spank with miso, grill to a charred mess and call dinner. But these can become as deadening a trope as that damn wild mushroom risotto. At Land there is none of that. It’s why I would encourage as many cooks as possible to get to Birmingham right now to see what chef Adrian Luck is doing there. The rest of you should pop along, too. His menu of almost entirely vegan cookery is short – just three choices at each course – but it should be filed under thrilling. There’s enormous, nerdy attention to detail alongside a precise understanding of both acidity and spice that lifts the seemingly humble far beyond its origins. We sit in the small downstairs dining room, at the bare wooden tables overseen by just one masked and attentive waiter, peering at plates of edible wonder. There are crescents of roasted onion squash the colour of a setting sun, on a bed of still-nutty puy lentils, bound by a mustardy dressing tangled with roasted red onion. What makes it sing is the addition of crisp lentils, perhaps deep-fried, to give it texture. There are the sweetest of Indian spice-roasted carrots, perched on a brilliant and vivid sweet-sour carrot and ginger purée. I could do serious damage to a bowl of that alone. There is the crunch of roasted seeds across the top. There are dribbles of what’s described as yogurt. As it’s a vegan dish, let’s assume nuts have been press-ganged into service. A potato rösti isn’t really, but let’s not get too hung up on nomenclature: it’s a plank of multilayered sliced potatoes, deep fried to an encouraging golden. There’s a cloud-like smoked-potato purée draped across the top, dusted with cep powder and, next to it, a spoonful of a boisterously acidulated mushroom ketchup. Oh boy. And on it goes. For a main course, a chunk of sweet potato has been roasted and partnered with a deep and sultry mole, that classic Mexican exercise in controlled burning used to produce a sauce full of spice and toasty dark-chocolate notes. There are whorls of avocado purée, and petals of the sweet potato skin, deep-fried for crunch. In another dish, sautéed king oyster mushrooms come on a cassoulet of borlotti beans lubricated with a little cream, the only dairy in the whole meal. The plate is topped with lacy “carbon tuiles” looking encouragingly like something worn by the women painted by Jack Vettriano. Celeriac, as familiar a non-meat trope as cauliflower and aubergine, is given a new and complex seeing to here. Chunks arrive roasted, under snowy slices of more of the same. Underneath are pearls of barley in a dark, umami-rich yeast broth. There’s a dusting of yeast across the top as well as dollops of a black garlic purée. I have a credo: non-meat dishes should be good because of that fact, rather than in spite of it. But I can’t help describing this celeriac dish as deep, intense and, well, meaty. With all these descriptions I will have missed a detail. I will have missed an ingredient or a moment of wizardry, because so much is going on. Adrian Luck is in complete control of his ingredients. It’s why I wish I could be just as enthusiastic about the desserts, but I can’t. Non-dairy creams can all too often have a musty, cereal back note, especially when sweetened. That’s what happens here in a sweetcorn tart with blackberries. The shell is tough and over-engineered, and the sweetcorn “cream” betrays its origins. Coconut milk might have been Luck’s friend here. A rapeseed oil cake with stewed apple, dribbles of caramel and a scoop of brisk buttermilk sorbet is much better, but lacks a certain largesse. Which is my fancy way of saying it needs loads more caramel. But ignore all that because of the brilliance that has gone before. Land is designed to take you somewhere new. Even the wine list is calculated to encourage experimentation. “If you like pinot noir,” says one heading, for example, before suggesting a gamay. And so we toast Luck’s cooking with a couple of glasses of godello because we like pinot grigio. I am aware that describing a restaurant like this as a find, when it’s been there for three years and always knew exactly where it was, might be a little insulting. But I can say that I’m delighted I’ve now found it. You should find it, too. News bites A new take on the cook-at-home ingredient delivery model: outside caterer Rocket, has launched a programme of food boxes entitled “A cook’s tour”. Alongside those ingredients, available for delivery nationwide, you also get access to a video cook-along, complete with live chat. Upcoming boxes include Flavours of Istanbul, Temples of Balinese Cuisine and Korean Street Food. The boxes cost from £55 for two. For more info visit acookstour.co.uk The tier 2 and 3 Covid-19 rules, prohibiting people meeting up indoors with anybody other than members of their own household, have resulted in mass restaurant cancellations. The Corbin and King group, which runs the Wolseley and Brasserie Zedel among others, says it lost 2,000 covers across the group to the end of October. At the same time a number of restaurant managers have told me that they are not clear how they are meant to police it. ‘Am I supposed to ask the members of every table for a proof of address?’ one maître d’ said to me. Another said there was a concern that, even to enquire of a table, might breach discrimination and equality legislation. In other news, Harrods in London’s Knightsbridge has announced it will be opening a branch of Gordon Ramsay Burger. It follows the success of the first in Las Vegas where the chef’s take on the humble hamburger costs up to $25.99. So there’s that.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(275,'2020-09-13T05:00:52Z','Delhi House Cafe, Manchester: ‘There is a lot to enjoy here’ – restaurant review','Delhi House Cafe, Unit 10, Corn Exchange, Manchester M4 3TR (0161 834 3333). Small plates £4.95-£9.50, large plates £6.95-£15.95, desserts £3.95-£5.50, wines from £18.75 On one wall at the newly opened Delhi House Cafe, inside Manchester’s Corn Exchange, is a set of portraits: a man in a red turban with a magnificent moustache of a sort songbirds could perch upon; a more humble chap in a vest pushing a tray of oven-inflated breads towards the lens; a young woman in chefs’ whites, grinning; an older woman in a more domestic kitchen getting the job done. These pictures surround a framed declaration of intent, headed “A Wall To Remember”. These people, it says, have inspired the Lamba family, who are behind this new venture. As the name implies, it draws upon the cooking of the Indian capital. “Some of the most loved dishes around the world today have been created by some very ordinary men and women in their very ordinary kitchens,” it says. “People who have raised the bar and left legacies for the future to follow.” All that the Delhi House Cafe team wants is to be “remembered as part of that list of creators.” Modest ambitions, then. I’ll leave posterity to do its capricious thing. Nevertheless, those images are a useful reminder. Very few dishes are truly original, and those that genuinely deserve to be described as such are often terrifying. Original is not the same as good. Any culinary tradition worth its salt, and various other seasonings, is an accretion of ideas and techniques shaped by the moment in which they were first pressed into service. Someone always went before. Here then, is the Delhi House Cafe, attempting to pick up the flame. Early on, a manager tells us that they are trying to offer something a little different from the standard high-street Indian restaurant. The shimmering white-on-white flock paper on one wall feels like a knowing wink in that direction. Other walls are of white painted brick or slapped with big tropical prints. Wicker lampshades dangle at different heights from the ducted ceiling, over a space filled with boldly garish banquettes. In truth, this bit of the proposition isn’t that radical for a city which already has outposts of Dishoom, Mowgli and Bundobust. All of them, as here, pull on domestic cooking traditions. What Delhi House Cafe does have is a real verve and enthusiasm. The restaurant has just turned eight days old as I lollop through the door, but it feels like a mature business well into its stride. It also boasts some of the best trained, and most cheery staff I have come across in a long while. A little worryingly, they mention that they want to introduce their own twist on all the dishes. The thought of twists makes my palms sweaty. Proudly, they also announce they don’t serve poppadoms, and it almost sounds like a provocation. There is no need to fret. Bar a couple of the dishes we tried, which I’ll come back to, there is a lot to enjoy here. From a section headed Mister Chaat come dahi poori, those tiny, crisp globes made from wheat flour, puffed in the fryer and filled with a mixture of chopped potatoes, chickpeas, tamarind and mint. You can try eating them daintily but you’ll get the contents down your shirt. It’s far better to slip the whole thing in your gob in one go. There’s the crunch and then the burst of tamarind sweetness across the satisfying mess of vegetables. The much-missed Kastoori in Tooting, south London, refused to do their puri for takeaway because they would never survive the journey. These are a jolly reminder of those. Other menu headings – Turfing the Streets, For the Occasion – are less revealing than perhaps they intended them to be. Just read the dish descriptions. A Goan prawn curry, in a deep-spiced tomato-based sauce, has an inbuilt culinary timer. You get the sweetness of the sauce and the fresh squeak of the seafood first, before the sudden punch of the chilli heat. Chicken ghee roast is a ripely sauced, butter-rich curry plump with thigh. Tandoori lamb chops are on as a special, and while they’ve trimmed off a little too much fat for my liking, they are still a glorious, spice-crusted exercise in bone nibblage. Alongside these come reassuringly well-executed basics: flaky parathas, heat-blistered naans and fluffy white rice. My doubts are over two deep-fried offerings. Both feel like a failure of nerve. The Amritsari fish fry brings crisp, golden battered pieces of fish and prawns, with barely any thumb print of the Indian tradition within which they are being served. They could come from anywhere. It’s the same with the JFC, which stands for Jama Masjid Fried Chicken. In an age when you can’t move for deep-fried bird, a plate of distinctively Indian-spiced drumsticks would be marvellous. These carry just a whisper of something strident. Both come with those chips that look like they might have been found in the freezer cabinet. Both dishes have a place on the menu. They are child friendly. I’m just sorry I ordered them. Still, there is the compensation of a dessert menu that’s more expansive than those found at most Indians. There’s a boldly sweet shortcrust pastry tart layered with gajar halwa, that mess of carrots cooked down in milk and sugar. It’s topped with Nutella and sits in a puddle of spiced custard. Be kind to your blood sugar levels and share it with a friend. There’s also a more mellow cheesecake with a thick base made with gooey Mysore pak. Think of it as an Indian equivalent of fudge which is trying to reduce its sugar content so it doesn’t get banned by the department of health. There’s a long cocktail list, a short wine list and a cheery selection of ales including White Rhino, one of India’s first craft beers. Mostly there’s the sense of a shared endeavour which is all heading in the right direction. It’s a welcome addition to the less than impressive offering at the Corn Exchange. Will the Delhi House Cafe earn its place on that wall to remember? There are a few great newspaper columnist clichés and finally I get to use one: only time will tell. Newsbites Talking of Manchester, the company behind the marvellous Albert’s Schloss on Peter Street has announced economy-defying expansion plans. Mission Mars is planning six openings, including two in London, plus one each in Leeds, Birmingham and Newcastle. However, the first will be in Liverpool, on a 10,000 sq ft site on Bold Street. Zumhof Biergarten will start with 385 seats, which will expand to a post-Covid-19 600 and will feature a 13m central bar, plus food operations. Eventually it will convert into an Albert’s Schloss (wearemissionmars.com). Big pie news. The Windmill pub, just off London’s Regent Street, has been taken over by the team behind the nearby Guinea Grill, and given a new menu which goes big on their award-winning suet pastry-wrapped loveliness. The new menu from chef Nathan Richardson features steak and mushroom, steak and kidney, chicken, bacon and mushroom, a fish pie and a shepherd’s pie as well as pumpkin chestnut and mushroom filo. Other options are available for the piephobic (windmillmayfair.co.uk). Chef Harriet Mansell has found a permanent home for her restaurant Robin Wylde in Lyme Regis after a successful six-month run as a pop-up. When it opens in a former pottery workshop on 25 October, she will offer a nine-course tasting menu, featuring a lot of pickling, preserving and fermentation of ingredients, sourced from close by.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(276,'2020-05-29T09:00:55Z','The thing I miss most in lockdown now? Pub beer gardens | Grace Dent','In case you’ve not noticed, going out – the comeback – has started. I have been out, and I’m not sure I like it. The new world has lots of rules and they’re largely opaque. And the dining out options are lousy. I began with a trip to a newly reopened fish and chip shop in Chingford, while resembling an extra from prison camp drama Tenko, hair-styling, mascara and bra-wearing having fallen off my agenda several months ago. Nowadays, only Rita Ora and women on TikTok wear actual makeup. The rest of us have grown too accustomed to not caring. Pre-lockdown, I wore more makeup than your average rodeo clown; right now, bothering even to tweezer a division in my monobrow feels fancy. No one will see me in the chip shop, anyway. The rules – because there are chip shop rules these days – say queuing in a confined space is forbidden. “Two people only permitted inside the shop,” the sign said. Everyone found this confusing. Did that mean two people from one household? Or two strangers? Did it mean that, if two people were inside the shop, I could stand outside and shout my order? Everyone’s confusion about the new rules made the woman serving us livid. Although I’m not sure if she was mad about us breaking the rules or mad that the rules meant she had to wear a mask. Alas, those chips, which I’d dreamed about and plotted over for more than 60 days, were lukewarm and soggy by the time I’d driven them home. The rules strictly forbid leaning against the ledge eating them hot and fresh in the chip shop while helping yourself to extra salt and vinegar, which, now that I think about it, was one of life’s sweetest, simplest pleasures. Yes, eating in a layby is, technically, permitted, but let’s face it, I’d look like a carb-loading dogger. I’m trying hard to love life in the new world, but my feelings are presently tepid. Along with chip shops and takeaway coffee, we seem to have been given back the right to have picnics. This is great news for fans of eating Sainsbury’s coleslaw somewhere that has no working toilet, throwing a scotch egg into a bush to re-route hornets, drinking too much warm rosé with friends of friends you have never really liked, and inevitably stinging your va-jay-jay on nettles while weeing. It’s a no from me, but many people are devotees. The rule seems to be that you can eat mini-quiches outdoors, but mind who you do it with. And do not, whatever you do, attempt to use a picnic bench in the park for your picnic, because they’re all still taped up like crime scenes. It could be time for us to question many of these things, and what we possibly need right now are more rule-breakers. The most useful thing Dominic Cummings could do for his country right now is to flout lockdown again, only this time do it in a pub beer garden. He needs to take one for the team. There are few sadder sights across the land than these much-loved but now abandoned sun traps, their tatty wooden benches baking indolently in the sun. All these unseasonably glorious May days have been going to waste, and for a man so fiercely Brexit, that is about as anti-British as it gets. I drove past a dozen pubs on my way home with my lukewarm chips, and my heart was colder still. Cummings’ last jaunt made us question our pilfered right to wander in forests and even take a pleasant day trip to Barnard Castle, but we need him for a much bigger job. He should start this Saturday morning with a swift drink on the lovely sun terrace outside the The Albion in Islington, before sinking four or so more – possibly with his top off – over lunchtime. Yes, the fallout would be incendiary, but once the quacking had stopped, something magical might happen. Perhaps we could prise these spaces open again. Although we’re grateful for car showrooms and golf clubs, these things mean nothing to the majority. And, obviously, there would need to be some rules – most of us have proved we’re good at following those – but there would also be cloudy cider with friends, giant Jenga, hot chips in a plastic basket, cheap ketchup in sachets, bad jokes and lots of sunburned forearms. Things will move on, but I know I will never take my right to loiter and languish, to laugh with friends or to drink lager from a pint glass for granted ever again.','https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/may/29/the-thing-i-miss-most-in-lockdown-now-pub-beer-gardensgrace-dent','Grace Dent','The thing I miss most in lockdown now?

Starters £6.50-£9.50, mains £13-£17.50, desserts £6, wines from £19.95 In the quiet months of lockdown, when they were only putting out takeaways, Kevin and Rachel Choudhary still had to tend to their restaurant, or more precisely the potted plants with which it is filled. There were the ones in the rough-hewn macramé baskets hanging over the bar, and the others in their thickly glazed ceramic pots, converting the sunlight from the floor-to-ceiling windows into mad growth thrown out in all directions. There were the tubs of herbs along the front of the open kitchen, destined for the pot. Sometimes we talk about restaurants as living creatures with a distinct pulse that needs to be nurtured. Street Urchin really did contain life forces that had to be cared for. That burgeoning foliage has justified the effort. It has softened the lines, not just of the concrete and steel space the restaurant calls home, but also of calamity. I’ve sat in a few dining rooms since the reopening and the necessary demands of social distancing can have uneasy impacts: you can be left eyeing barren acres of space between you and the next table, mourning what we all have lost rather than celebrating the things we have regained. Here, those potted plants have been put to work, filling one half of a four-seater table that has come down to a two, or creating a bold hedge of luscious fronds between diners. It makes for an unforced intimacy that this devoutly modern space, in the heart of Manchester’s burgeoning Ancoats, might otherwise lack. It also feels like a statement of intent. This is a relaxed room in which nice things happen. The Choudharys previously ran a pub in Altrincham and have carried with them the kind of restless eclecticism that we associate with the British gastropub. They call it an “English Market Diner”. Initially that struck me as a winning diagonal line in a game of restaurant word bingo. But they are in England, they buy their ingredients in a marketplace of some sort and they then serve that food to people who can dine upon it. The words function. Kevin Choudhary knows how to use words on a menu, too. On the day of my booking I was emailed a photograph of both the main blackboard and the specials. I spent half an hour thumbing my screen in anticipation, and dribbling. Thank God the iPhone 8 is water-resistant. Consider “tikka marinated trout, celeriac dill bhaji, mint yogurt salad” or “sautéed chicken livers and homemade tea-smoked chorizo, spicy tomato sauce” or “seared, glazed duck breast, slow-braised duck noodle broth, coriander, green bean and peanut salad.” I love it when a restaurant flirts with me like that. What matters, of course, is whether they can cook those dishes. For the most part, they can. There are a few sausage-making skills in this kitchen, which is never a bad thing. A good sausage invariably brings joy. Here, they are pressed into the service of what they call “morcilla-style” black pudding, by which they mean a spiced version. Making your own black pudding so close to the home of the Bury Black Pudding Company, which is to blood-sausage-making what Miles Davis was to the trumpet, only without the mournfulness – black pudding and jazz; bite me – takes confidence. It’s rewarded. Theirs is dense and with an edge of fire and comes on a big splodge of a bold tomato chutney. On the top is nest of an apple and walnut salad. It’s a cheerful tumble of great ingredients. It’s there, too, in the chicken liver dish, sitting on top of a raft of that smoky, grainy chorizo, and properly drenched in the sort of punchy tomato sauce that makes patatas bravas so compelling. There’s a slab of bread underneath that gets left behind. We have a chorizo raft. What do we need with bread? A special of tempura queenie scallops and squid rings, with battered samphire on a potato cake, is less successful. I get the idea: the softness of the seafood, under the shatter of the finest batter. Certainly the scallops haven’t been violated, but it’s all just a little overseasoned. Apparently, the chef’s dad is a fisherman, which is why fish get such star billing. Here, that’s a large plaice, grilled to golden, glossed with molten butter with a dipping sauce of pickled ginger and parsley. The flesh slides easily from the bone. The ginger adds a little sparkle. It’s a lot of fish for £17.50. We also have a poussin with a sweet chilli glaze. It comes with a Caesar salad. I am tempted to whinge now that it contains boquerones, or vinegared anchovies, which don’t belong in the classic Caesar. If you’re going to throw in an anchovy at all it should be salted. I also find them jarring. But I’m willing now to shrug and accept it. I constantly bang on about the cult of authenticity being a dead end where food is concerned. All recipes change over time. Nothing stands still. So, I suppose I have to acknowledge that putting boquerones in a Caesar is now a thing. By repetition, the recipe has changed. People do it. I’ll just moan quietly to myself about it and feel as old as time. For his star dessert Kevin told me he wanted to play with the idea of the Manchester tart, a short-crust case containing a layer of jam topped with custard and sprinkled with coconut. He deep-fries balls of puff pastry, fills them with custard and sprinkles them with sweetened, grated coconut. He serves them with a jug of loosened jam for dipping. He calls them Manchester Moneyballs and they are both delightful and fun to eat. They are also a perfect match for that favourite from Latin America (and elsewhere), buñuelos: deep-fried, sugared dough balls, which often come filled. Clearly this bit of Ancoats is now twinned with Mexico City. Service was managed slickly by two waiters in black masks bearing the image of the Manchester bee, the venerable mark of the city’s hard graft and unity. It’s a sweet touch in an area like Ancoats, with its history of cotton milling. By the 1990s the area had fallen into disrepair. In recent years, however, it has developed a reputation as Manchester’s independent trading heart. Until the virus hit, it was rich with flat whites and artisan bakeries, with craft ales and the sort of rumbustious enterprise which makes life better. The reopening of Street Urchin is a sign it can be again. News bites A group of chefs and restaurants from Bristol, including Pasta Loco, The Pipe and Slippers, and Josh Eggleton of The Pony and Trap, have joined forces to create a socially distanced outdoor space for eating and drinking. The pop-up, entitled Breaking Bread, opened this weekend at the bottom of Clifton Downs. There’s a beer garden, plus a food operation offering a selection of dishes from the various participating businesses including Eggleton’s slow-cooked lamb breast with braised white beans and salsa verde, and the chocolate delice with salted caramel from Pasta Loco. A portion of profits will go to support local community and hospitality projects. Bookings are now being taken at breakingbreadbristol.co.uk A survey by hospitality industry analysis company MCA has found that the majority of businesses will not be passing on the whole of the recently announced cut in VAT for the sector from 20% to 5%, arguing that they need the extra revenue to shore up their finances. A number of large high-street names, including Nando’s and KFC, have said they will be reducing prices accordingly. The gorgeously classic French Soho stalwart L’Escargot is heading to the beach for the whole of August. It’s launching the pop up L’Escargot Sur-Mer at Aldeburgh on the Suffolk coast.

Kerridge’s grand dining room – one of the most elegant in the north-west, certainly – is all dressed up in shades of calming sage, bottle green and rich camel, and the Edwardian baroque architecture is made all the more joyful by its revamped brass and marble features. There are bowler-hatted doormen, a polished chessboard reception hall floor, Relais &amp; Chateaux luxury boutique hotel membership, Ruud van Nistelrooy hocking up phlegm on the pitch after blasting one in past Everton during a montage of classic goals, exquisite cutlery and a bold, far-reaching wine list. Sorry, pardon, wind back: one of those things isn’t at all like the rest. “Are the TVs ever turned up?” I asked a waitress during one of at least six attempts to accept The Bull &amp; Bear’s decision to play Gillette Fusion 5 razor advertsas I looked at the special menu that features a baked potato with caviar for £74. I’m all sports, all of the time. “No, the sound is never on,” she replied, smiling the same bright, “I have literally no idea what you’re getting at” smile that all the staff wear. No amount of poking broke them. The Bull &amp; Bear’s front of house, I should say here, are wonderful – Manchester’s finest. Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs, the ex-footballers who funded this project, should be rightfully proud. I stayed alone in the hotel for one night, ate twice at Kerridge’s restaurant, and checked out with some regret at leaving behind the cosseted ambience, the wine cellars with their fantastic tasting room, the communal hallways scented regularly with some sort of sweet, light, tasteful patchouli. You are a million miles from the Arndale centre, but at the same time just 500 metres away. The food, currently, is not excellent; it is good, and beautifully presented, but somewhere along the line, the urge to turn honest, decent pub grub such as chicken kiev, scotch egg and Manchester tart into fine-dining small plates becomes a little uninspiring. Edible, likable, at times delicious and certainly served with absolute aplomb, yes. But a small, quite dry chicken kiev is what it is, no matter how much blood, sweat and tears were poured into its provenance and execution. Weirdly, a chicken kiev cooked by Neil “Razor” Ruddock, man mountain and former Millwall defender, on Celebrity MasterChef was one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten. No, that is not a sentence I expected me to write, either. Ruddock’s enormous kiev, which he claimed was chicken but may well have been emu, was stuffed with so much butter, garlic and chopped parsley that for the rest of the month my breath entered rooms before even my breasts. And it was totally worth it. The Bull &amp; Bear’s kiev, on the other hand, is polite, perfectly rolled and comes on a tablespoon of crushed wild garlic potatoes. That’s a sort of lumpy mashed spud, I say uncritically, because all types of mashed spud are valid. A side of pommes boulangère (sliced spuds and onion baked in stock) arrived a little lukewarm. Salt cod scotch egg was a little lacklustre, the egg’s casing being not especially fishy, and the red pepper sauce mainly a puddle of redness that delivered nothing. It was as large as a golf ball, cost £10.50 and was saved only by a slice of chorizo, although almost anything can be lifted by the salty, paprika-y porkiness of chorizo, which must be to the chagrin of pigs worldwide. The loveliest thing I ate was a delightful bowl of Cornish monkfish with a Keralan moilee curry sauce filled with generous handfuls of sultanas, pine nuts and capers and served on Tenderstem broccoli: outstanding. I ate this while watching some adverts for shaving balm and betting apps. With the sound turned off. Leave it, Grace, leave it. The television scenario reminds me of the time in my early 20s when I had my nose pierced, and the more everyone said that the diamond stud absolutely did not suit me, that it jarred with my style, my poise and my demeanour, the more determined I was to keep it, even though at one stage it got infected, streamed pus and looked vaguely bubonic. I kept it for far too long because I knew I was right. But I wasn’t. • The Bull &amp; Bear 4 Norfolk Street, Manchester M2, 0161-470 3902.

Starters £5.50-£8.50, mains £17-£29, desserts £7.50, wines from £18 Some of the best journeys bring you right back home. Paul Huddleston has been on exactly that journey. For a few years he cooked at the Criterion, when Marco Pierre White had the lease on London’s most outrageous room, and used it to make chicken kiev sexy. Afterwards he went to Paris to cook at another landmark, Le Jules Verne, perched on the second floor of the Eiffel Tower, where it could look down on all the other restaurants. Superstar chef Alain Ducasse was in charge then and he liked to dispatch his brigades off on stints at his other outposts. Huddleston went to the Michelin three-star Louis XV in Monaco, where the dining room groans with pendulous chandeliers and the glint and shimmer of the Mediterranean is part of the deal. Finally, Huddleston made that trip home, to open his own restaurant by his own stretch of water. He returned to an old Yorkshire stone Quayside building in Shipley, down by the canal where the painted houseboats nudge each other along, and the dogs who live aboard those barges stand forever proud, sniffing the air, faithful until death. It’s not Monaco. It’s much better than that. Just before the lockdown eased, I tweeted restaurants outside London asking them to let me know their reopening plans. I was getting a lot of effusive electronic traffic from glitzy places in the capital. I was getting far less information from elsewhere, and a partial story is no story at all. My inbox filled quickly with a heartening narrative. We have had cause during this crisis to talk of something called the Hospitality Industry, as if it were akin to steel manufacturing, when in truth it is just a bunch of people trying to show a bunch of other people a really nice time. And here those people were: nervous of what was to come, exasperated by the sophistry, preening and mixed messages from central government, but gagging to do their best in the circumstances. Most of the emails came from the restaurants themselves. Some, however, came from customers who were simply delighted that a place they loved was reopening. They had missed an old friend. The Waterside Bistro and Bar in Shipley was one of those. It has a lot of customers who love it very much, and I can quite see why. From a tiny kitchen Paul and his sous chef Elvis – there really is a guy works down the bistro swears he’s Elvis; sorry, but I had to – turn out plates of big flavoured food, underpinned by big kitchen technique. You could start with a prawn cocktail here, but that cocktail will come with nuggets of deep-fried lobster, and the funky kick of brown crabmeat and nutmeg. There will be crisp leaves of lettuce, built for scooping. You can follow that with a steak from an animal raised nearby, but it will have been dry-aged in a room lined with salt from the Himalayas and come with a range of sauces – peppercorn, Diane – so classic they could name a horse race after them. So far so gloriously, encouragingly 70s. All those dishes need is a Demis Roussos soundtrack to complete the moment. But there is more recent ambition at work here. Even just a thimble of vegetable soup to get us going is a luscious, well-made thing and, on a summer’s day that’s auditioning for autumn, it’s welcome. Alongside that prawn, crab and lobster cocktail there’s a very competent terrine of confit chicken and apricots, served just warm enough so that it’s soft and yielding, with a salad of micro herbs and an apricot gel. It has not sacrificed eatability for looks. It’s made by someone who knows you have come for lunch, not to admire the handicrafts. A thick disc of braised pork collar arrives with pieces of roasted fillet and golden, bubbled fragments of battered black pudding that shatter beneath the teeth. For we are in Yorkshire and this is what a proper lunch looks like. There are delicate rings of pickled onion and to bring it all together a sweet savoury cider and pork stock jus. It’s a great sauce and only beaten to the win by the rust-coloured lobster bisque that comes with a seared fillet of skin-on trout perched on crushed new potatoes, spun through with crab. The sauce performs a very good supporting role on the plate, but I’m not ashamed to tell you I ended up spooning it out of the jug, mostly because I’ve realised a sense of shame will never serve me well in this job. Perched on top, like the star on the top of a Christmas tree, is a fried raviolo of crab and ginger. At around £17 each, both of these dishes are great value. There’s also a pared-back lunch menu: battered hake and beef dripping chips for £9; a fish finger or mackerel sandwich; a bavette for £12. If you’re one of those cracking your knuckles prior to typing an online comment whingeing about price, please consider the current realities. First, for the quality and volume – this is Shipley, after all, and here portion size is always worthy of discussion – the bill would be reasonable even in normal circumstances. But these are not normal circumstances. They have an outside terrace area overlooking the canal that will work for lunches and, with heaters, for some balmy evenings. But the inside dining room with its brown wood floor and ceiling and rough old York stone does not have space for many at the best of times and now, with tables removed to maintain social distancing, is further restricted. To state the bloody obvious, fewer tables mean less income, mean a tougher route to survival. Paul and his wife Nicola told me they did OK during lockdown. Both went to work for Morrisons, and they were able to keep their two other employees on furlough. But they need support. If you can give it, please do. We get a platter of desserts. To one side is a bronzed bakewell tart in a case of what seems like compressed puff. To the other is a layered cake of soft, dense chocolate sponge with a filling of salted peanut butter caramel. In between these two is a scoop of a bright rhubarb ice-cream. I try to imagine what Alain Ducasse would have made of it all in Monaco, and then I realise I really don’t care. Paul Huddleston came home and brought his good taste with him. That’s what matters. News bites Although restaurants are gently reopening, many businesses are still innovating to keep trading. One of those is The Clink, the UK charity which runs restaurants from within four prisons, providing training in catering skills to serving prisoners. The Clink at HMP Brixton has just launched Clink@Home. It’s a delivery service of dishes, to be heated at home, to within five miles of the prison. Starters include sun dried tomato and parmesan arancini or vegetable gyoza at £3.95 each, while mains – jerk chicken with rice and peas, lasagne, sea bream en papillote – are all £8. There’s a minimum order of £35. Visit athome.theclinkcharity.org. Meanwhile the much-admired Manchester-based Rudy’s pizza group have launched a bake-at-home pizza menu, delivered nationwide. All pizzas, which currently include the calabrese, the portobello and the carni, are £6.50 each and simply require finishing in the oven at home. There is a minimum order of four pizzas. Visit rudyspizza.co.uk. For more of this sort of thing, take a look at greatfood2u.co.uk which has brought together meal kit offerings from a number of independent operators for delivery nationwide.

Small plates £6-£8, large plates £12.50-£16.50, ice-creams and sorbets £3 a scoop, wines from £22 In the days following my dinner at Lahpet on London’s Bethnal Green Road, I could often be found fridge-hanging, teaspoon in hand. I was waiting for the moment when, unwatched, I could take a crafty scoop from one of the white, resealable bags of balachaung that I had smuggled home with me, so I could eat it neat. Balachaung is one of the more ubiquitous condiments from the country I will refer to as Burma (as that’s the name Lahpet uses). Trust me. You need balachaung in your life. It’s a toasty mix of caramelised dried shrimps, shrimp paste, crispy fried garlic and shallots, with a gentle hit from fragrant roasted chillies. It is slightly sticky and full of deep, dark notes. It’s intensely savoury, but also sweet and rich and goes very well on rice – its traditional use. It’s also good on noodles. And with roasted courgettes. And barbecued pork. And as a sprinkled topping for a fried egg, and across cheese on toast and… well, you get the idea. There are members of the current Cabinet who might be moderately palatable if buried under sufficient balachaung. Not very many, I grant you, but a few. I am not ashamed to say I knew little of Burmese food before I ate at Lahpet. I don’t need to be ashamed. My job isn’t to know everything. My job is to find myself a guide to what I don’t know. In this case it’s MiMi Aye, who was born in Margate to a family from Burma. They instilled in her a love for the country where they all began, through language, ritual and, of course, food. Last year she published Mandalay, a gorgeous book full of narrative and recipes, with an unignorable cover in the brightest of yellows and the deepest of crimsons. It schooled me lightly in a culinary Burma, a country whose food is influenced by its proximity to China, India and Thailand, but which is much more than simply an amalgam of that. For example, the repertoire includes a profoundly developed interest in fritters. Apparently, the Burmese love deep-fried stuff. This is something we can all get behind. The menu at Lahpet, a light and airy space clad in lots of blond wood to soften the Shoreditch concrete and steel, starts with a selection of three fritters for £8. They arrive in jolly paper cones, as if it’s a day at the seaside, alongside a bright, sour tamarind dipping sauce. There are gnarly, rugged ones made with kidney beans and the slap of ginger, and others made from a split-pea purée. These flank the revelation: rectangular, golden sticks of deep-fried shan tofu, made from gram flour, with a reassuring outer crunch giving way to a molten centre. Where have these been all my life? Texture is key. Lahpet thoke is a traditional salad made with pickled tea leaves, but there is so very much more going on here than the humble word “salad” suggests. It’s a salad with a lengthy CV and killer references. Alongside the tea leaves and shredded cabbage there’s the crunch of peanuts and of those crisp-fried broad beans we are familiar with from Spanish delis. There are dried shrimps and sesame seeds and a little chilli, for while a certain amount of heat is part of the story, it’s not there to bash you about the head. There’s a sweet-sour dressing with the high waft of garlic oil. It’s a heap of good things that needs to be excavated in search of ever deeper textural joy. Sweet and savoury are not competing ideas, to be kept away from each other. Here, they are part of the same adventure. Pieces of pork, braised until they are only just keeping it together, come in a thick, almost black curry sauce full of caramel tones, mustard greens and brooding intent. It’s the edible equivalent of one of those bravura movie performances that everyone agrees is a shoo-in for a best acting Oscar, by dint of intensity alone. By comparison, the Burmese classic mohinga, a catfish and lemongrass chowder, is almost light and carefree. But it’s still a belter. A thick, pungent broth made with lemongrass, ginger, garlic and fish stock (and much else) bobs with pieces of sliced fish cake, rice noodles and slabs of soft-boiled egg (and much else). Bronzed and bubbled split-pea fritters, which fracture pleasingly beneath the teeth, are half-submerged, but seem never to lose their echoing crunch. Again, it’s a dish that demands your attention. Both of these are £12.50. The most showy plate of food, at £16.50, is the bream. The fillets have been taken off each side of the fish, crisp-fried and dressed with a mess of shallots, tomato and garlic. A few greens are there for healthy ballast. The remaining skeleton has then been deep fried and now perches, whole and tail up, on the plate. We are invited to break off pieces and eat them, too. We need little encouragement. Eventually, I move on to seeking out the nuggets of pearly white flesh around the head. All this, plus a bowl of that balachaung on the side, for added punch and kick. We drink a rather lovely rhubarb and lemon thyme spritz and a less successful whisky-based cocktail called a Smokey Monkey, made with bitter orange, mango and red chilli jam. It’s the latter which I remember, and not in a good way. It’s like stubbing your toe; the discomfort comes in late. Still, there’s a fine beer list, including a Burmese lager, and a short selection of wines. Lahpet, the Burmese word for tea, started as a food truck in Maltby Street by London’s Tower Bridge in 2017 and then became a pop-up before landing here in 2018. It’s a project by Dan Anton, who has Burmese heritage, and head chef Zaw Mahesh, who was born in Burma and came to the UK more than a decade ago to train as a chef. The curving, wood-clad bar in the centre has enabled them to separate out the tables for social distancing, and they have a sizeable terrace space. On a warm evening that terrace is buzzing with younger London, keeping their distance from each other, but apparently delighted to be here, as was I. By the door they sell copies of MiMi Aye’s book should you want to know more, plus 200g bags of the balachaung. I take two, which is almost an Imperial pound’s worth. It is all gone within a week, and I mourn its passing. Newsbites Chef Kevin Tickle, who headed up the kitchen at Simon Rogan’s L’Enclume for many years before winning his own Michelin star at The Forest Side near Grasmere, has announced his next venture. He and his wife Nicola have taken over The Crown Inn, a 17th-century coaching inn, within the Lake District village of High Newton. It will reopen in late autumn after a major refurbishment, with six bedrooms, a small-plates offering in the pub and a restaurant with the sort of tasting menu for which Tickle is renowned. Chef and broadcaster Andi Oliver and restaurant veteran and TV presenter Fred Sirieix, who first worked together on a recent episode of BBC TV’s Remarkable Places To Eat in Marrakesh, have just launched a pop-up. One Love will run for a month at the Clapton Country Club in east London, and will offer a menu of Caribbean-influenced dishes with French touches. Expect the likes of orange and ginger sticky wings, saucisson with gherkin relish, and Andi’s curry goat made with dark chocolate (which she wouldn’t stop going on about on BBC Radio 4’s Kitchen Cabinet).

Small plates (Wednesday-Saturday) £5-£9, wines from £33, tasting menu (Thursday-Saturday) £65 Fred Foster always dreamed of having a restaurant. He’d supplied fruit and veg to some of the grandest places in London: to the Dorchester and Le Gavroche, and to the great Nico Ladenis in his pomp. It was the logical step. In the end it took a pandemic to make it a reality. “If it hadn’t been for lockdown, we wouldn’t have had a chance to work alongside so many chefs,” Fred told me, when I spoke to him a few days after eating at his pop-up, carved out of the enclosure which, during the day, houses his produce company, Turnips. “That’s how this happened.” Turnips is a brazen, shameless display of what plants can do given the right encouragement. When Borough Market is at full, gustatory throttle it’s one of those places you go to gawp: at tumbles of wild mushrooms, and vast arrays of melons piled high; at fat, scarlet-blushed radishes, and tangled thickets of green herbs. Turnips, which started in Pimlico, was one of the original traders to move to Borough more than three decades ago, long before its rebirth as a duck confit stuffed, pork pie mongering, gruyère and truffle peddling, oyster crusted retail food destination in the late 90s. It remained a fixed point as the space went through ever more polished renovations. Few things have stayed the same at Borough over the years. There’s the chorizo roll from Brindisa, more cultural icon than mere food item. And then there’s Turnips. (Side note: I have no patience for those who now sneer at Borough as some tawdry tourist spot. If the market was elsewhere in Europe, the very same self-appointed food grandees who dismiss it would be crawling on their greasy hands and knees to be there and would boast about doing so.) From early in lockdown, Turnips was sending fruit and veg boxes to vulnerable groups in need, and cooks from some of the restaurants they usually supplied came to help. Among them was Tomas Lidakevicius, one-time executive chef at Jason Atherton’s City Social. “It was while working side by side that we came up with the plan,” Fred says. Or to be exact, two plans. Across from the main Turnips enclosure, tables and chairs have been set out. There’s a temporary open kitchen from which Lidakevicius serves a five-course tasting menu for £65 a head, designed to show off the produce at hand to its best advantage, with flourish and bravado. In the current economic circumstances that strikes me as a brave move. Certainly, I was more interested in the second part of the operation. At 5.30pm every Wednesday to Saturday, Turnips closes and most of the produce is shifted out, save for an escarpment of squash here or a hillside of apples there. Black drapes cover the emptied stands and high-top tables are brought in. Turnips becomes a small-plates restaurant, serving cocktails and a short menu of dishes priced at between £5 and £9. A few baby turnips are involved. They arrive alongside slices of crisp radish and batons of pepper, among other things, to be dragged through a rough-hewn, punchy hummus, the surface dusted with rust-coloured spice. To start there are long rectangles of bread which have been deep-fried to a shattering, come-hither golden, alongside an airy, whipped and still warm sauce of cheddar and garlic. Bruschetta are piled with a sea-green pesto made with cavolo nero, with just the edge of the leaf’s bitterness, then topped with the sweetest of chopped tomatoes. A dinky, round Provençal courgette arrives, browned and burnished until just beginning to sag. It has been sliced open, scooped out and filled with a mess of tomatoes, basil and breadcrumbs. A thick, cumin-boosted purée of sweet potato and lentils is formed into deep-fried croquettas. They arrive dotted with wasabi mayo, some of which hold the tiniest fronds of a purple leaf. It looks very pretty, but more importantly those croquettas are extravagantly moreish. And, as it happens, Moorish. I am taken by small, taut-skinned fish balls because they remind me, in semi-Proustian fashion, of the fish balls sold by the Jewish deli where I was tolerated for a short-lived Saturday job when I was a kid. They are dense and have a pronounced and unashamed fishiness. It’s mediated by the rowdy, spiced Sicilian pepper sauce underneath. Two dishes miss the mark. A sizeable chunk of pork belly, the only meat on the menu, needs a longer, more complex trip through the oven so it slumps rather than puts up a struggle against my fork, though the sticky peach compôte on top is appreciated. Likewise, sweet-sour caramelised cauliflower is just a little wan and uninteresting. Then again, the brigade in the kitchen numbers just one. He’s a young Scot with killer hair, also formerly from City Social, called Scott Murray, who works minor miracles with the most minimal of kit. The one dessert is a pleasing mess of chia seeds, in a coconut milk pudding with diced and puréed mango. It is, like so much here, a reminder of the lovely things they sell at Turnips. I also ask nicely, and get the dessert from Lidakevicius’s tasting menu brought over. It’s one of those extremely pleasing compendiums of chocolate and cherries in multiple textures, each dollop placed just so. The waiters are recruits from the grander of London’s still-sleeping restaurants, who are clearly delighted to be working. Even so, there is a Summer Stock feel, of the show being put on, right here, in the pigeon-roosted, soot-caked barn. That rackety element is best represented by the short and unrewarding wine list. They can do better than £33 for the cheapest white, a sturdy but unremarkable Kiwi sauvignon blanc. But there is also something lovely about what they’re doing here. Borough Market can’t quite be itself at the moment. Nowhere can. They have created a one-way system through the stands, and there are many blank corners. But this feels like a clever response to these challenging circumstances. Eating outside is desirable right now. There is space to distance the tables. And then there’s the Turnips stock, sales of which must be down right now. How better to deal with that than by serving some of it? And so, finally, Fred has his restaurant. It will run at least until the end of September. News bites Among the food businesses reopening at the moment is the Leeds Cookery School, a social enterprise which donates all its profits to Zest, a charity supporting vulnerable people and those dealing with poverty across the city. They have just launched a course in Greek cookery, perfect for anyone missing their getaway this year, and in November they’ll be running a class in the food of Vietnam (leedscookeryschool.org.uk). Andy Waugh and Calum Mackinnon, the team behind Scottish restaurant and butchery company Mac &amp; Wild, have announced they are to launch what they say will be the biggest single food and beverage site in Scotland, inside the shiny new Edinburgh St James development. Bonnie and Wild will cover over 16,000 sq ft, and will feature eight restaurant brands alongside a high-end retail offering. Meanwhile, elsewhere in the Scottish capital, The Little Chartroom restaurant has opened a pop-up at the western end of the Portobello Prom, offering barbecue to take away. The menu, available from noon until six, Wednesday to Sunday, includes the likes of mussel popcorn, lamb flatbread with smoked aubergine and tomato anchovy sauce and an ox cheek pastrami bun with black garlic BBQ sauce. The Little Chartoom itself, over on Albert Place, has just reopened (thelittlechartroom.com).

Small plates £4.20-£7.50, large plates £6.10-£13.70, desserts £3.80- £5.50, wines from £26 For those of us who live in cities, one of the most dislocating things about the lockdown was the way it forced us to live in villages. Londoners often talk about the way the capital forms into small neighbourhoods, each akin to a village. We say these things to dispel the notion that it’s a cruel, disorientating sprawl where nobody knows your name. And it’s true. I can tell you a lot about the community that lives in the south London streets I’ve called home these past three decades. But when I give this speech I am also protesting too much. If I wanted to live in a village, I’d move to one. I live in London’s sprawl for a reason. I love my neighbourhood, but I also crave the noise and clamour beyond it – the one that others who don’t live here might find disorientating. I have a figurative hunger for the rush and clutter of languages and cultures, and a literal hunger for the food. It’s a simple way by which to begin understanding a community. I love the jerk restaurants of Brixton where I live, where the air always smells of smoke and spice rub and time. I adore the ocakbaşi kebab houses in north London’s Green Lanes, the heart of the Turkish community, where intense men tend to the serious business of turning skewers of the good stuff over smouldering coals. There are the Middle Eastern cafés along the Edgware Road, and the Vietnamese places in Shoreditch and the Portuguese bars that throng South Lambeth Road. This is what makes cities so beguiling. A mark of that: when the government announced it was now OK to drive wherever you wished to take exercise, a lot of people motored off to woodlands to stroll among the bluebells. Me? I bagged a Zipcar and drove to Soho to check that, like some Brigadoon, London hadn’t disappeared in the Covid mist. The bricks and mortar were still there, but the city wasn’t, not quite. For cities are made by their people and at that point it was like something out of I Am Legend, only without the portentous underscore, the mutants or the wild dogs. Which is what made an evening at the Sri Lankan restaurant Kolamba on Kingly Street so thrilling. This restaurant drag, just back from Regent Street, wasn’t thronging with the masses, and quite right, too. But there was life here of a particular kind. It was a reminder that London, like so many of our great towns and cities, is only the sum of its people, so many of whom started elsewhere. Here was a team of those people seemingly thrilled to be back doing what they’d only started doing last summer when Kolamba first opened. Mostly, there was a menu of punchy, elbow-in-the-ribs dishes, which can transport you elsewhere. The food draws on the domestic culture of the founders, first-time restaurateurs Eroshan and Aushi Meewella, who grew up in Sri Lanka’s capital, Colombo. Or, as they say in Sinhalese, Kolamba. The Meewellas have a design background and it shows in a space that has been made over in a style best described as – checks notes – “tropical modernism”. This means it’s a riot of oatmeal. The distressed brick walls in shades of artisanal granola give way to leather banquettes the colour of Jordans Country Crisp and a floor that recalls Kellogg’s Crunchy Nut. (I have just invented this UK breakfast cereal colour chart, and will be patenting it, though I live in fear of the restaurant that demands I reference Limited Edition Unicorn Fruit Loops.) There are big woven hanging lampshades and lighting turned down to that place on the dial marked “moody”. It’s calming, and suits a muggy, damp summer’s evening. We sit outside, just beyond the picture windows that have been completely opened back, and scan the QR code on our phones – a simple way to remove the need for printed menus. If the room is in muted tones, the food arrives in vibrant gashes of colour. From the section of the menu headed “short eats” – a phrase which makes me grind my teeth, but we live in the age of nice, so we’ll say no more about it – come strips of battered and deep-fried cuttlefish in a sweet, fiery sauce. There’s a lime for squeezing over the top, to up the acidity. The chummily named Aunty Mo’s “chatti” roast makes me want Mo to be my aunty, too. There are pebbles of slow-cooked beef that have then been dry-fried. It’s the very essence of a dry meat curry and lies on a fat tangle of string hoppers – noodles made with fermented rice-flour batter. There is also a deep green coconut sauce for lubrication, dotted with shimmering drops of flavoured oils, so it looks like an edible lava lamp. From the bigger dishes there are chunks of pork belly braised down in coconut milk, flavoured with lemon grass and curry leaves until sticky and caramelised. Black pepper prawn fry is a mess of powerfully sauced seafood with mandatory head suckage to finish. Ask for extra napkins. You may well find a use for that bottle of hand sanitiser that you have taken to carrying with you when you’re done. Don’t wear a white shirt. But the standout dish is the seemingly humble dal. It barely needs saying that the simple three-letter word covers a multitude of textures. This one is less soup than fiery stew. It is thick, and the lentils, simmered in coconut milk that has been turned the deepest of yellows by the application of turmeric, have serious bite. If we want more heat, we have a sambal of grated coconut, boosted with chilli and onions. A lot of these dishes were given a wider audience by the restaurant Hoppers, named after the familiar bowl-shaped pancakes made from that fermented rice-flour batter, which opened not far away on Frith Street in 2015. Perhaps because of this, the menu here makes their small hoppers something of an afterthought. We finish with the mellifluously named watalappam, a set custard of spiced coconut with cashew nuts, and scoops of salted jaggery ice-cream. I have made it clear that it’s a lovely dinner, and a calming, restorative space. But it is something else. Kolamba is the gentle, ocean-deep pulse of the wide and diverse city, reasserting itself. News bites Andrew Edmunds, one of the most beloved and venerable of restaurants in London’s Soho, has launched a three-course Date Night box at £55 for two. It’s available nationwide and to be booked in advance for Friday delivery. The meat version might include dressed crab with fennel salad, braised lamb with red cabbage followed by summer pudding; for non-meat-eaters there’s the likes of chickpea and squash hummus with radish followed by crispy polenta and carrots, onions and salsa verde. There’s also a more extensive London-only option. Visit andrewedmunds.com. So it’s farewell to cronut creator Dominique Ansel who, having made his name in New York, opened a bakery in London’s Victoria in 2016 followed in February of this year by his Treehouse in Covent Garden. The latter closed at the start of lockdown and will not reopen. The bakery operated for takeaway, but that will also close permanently at the end of August. In cheerier news Corbin &amp; King, operators of the Wolseley and Brasserie Zedel among others, are to re-open the Bellanger site in London’s Islington on August 14. Originally it was a shiny Alsatian brasserie but it closed in 2019 after four years trading. The new iteration will have a general menu of French brasserie classics and pricing which mirrors the much cheaper Zedel. Visit corbinandking.com.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(287,'2020-07-19T05:00:41Z','At last, going out for lunch, in a French place really worth the wait','Pique-Nique, Tanner Street Park, London SE1 3LD (020 7403 9549). Small plates £6.50-£10.50, large sharing dishes £42-£68, desserts £6.50-£7.50, wines from £18 A bright summer’s day, 36 hours after the easing of lockdown, and I am seated at a wide, socially distanced marble-topped counter. Two plates of food are pushed towards me. One holds tomatoes in brilliant reds, yellows and purples dressed with snowy white feta, shiny black olives and fat caper berries on their stalks, like musical notes in search of a stave. The other is a slice of pâté en croûte, the chubby pink of the pork studded with the brilliant green of pistachio and all of it framed by the Ford Granada walnut trim of glazed pastry work. Look at these plates of loveliness. I am thrilled to be here at Pique-Nique, in a low-slung building tucked into the corner of a small sports ground in Bermondsey, south London. It’s not simply that restaurants have been able to reopen after more than 100 days. It’s that, in the past day and a half, not every eating adventure has worked out quite as well. My first restaurant meal, chasing news deadlines, had been at Trullo, a neighbourhood Italian at Highbury Corner in north London. I was the first customer through the door on the day of reopening – and it was delightful. The second, later that evening, not so much. In early June a flashy London restaurant dropped a marketing email, inviting me to book for 4 July. I rewarded their bravado by booking for this week’s column. And so that Saturday night off I went, my heart full of unalloyed optimism. It was various kinds of awful: underportioned servings of overengineered food at ludicrous prices, and wines by the glass measured out as if they were trying to get nine pours out of each bottle. As dinner trundled on, my heart fell to meet my knees. Oh God. I had recently tweeted that, for the foreseeable future, I wouldn’t be publishing negative reviews. If I went somewhere dismal, I would merely chalk it up to experience and move on. And now I was somewhere dismal. My tweet hadn’t struck me as particularly controversial. God knows the restaurant business has been through enough. It didn’t need me going all Inigo Montoya from The Princess Bride on failing places, as someone once put it. Some argued I would be failing in my duty as a ruthless, blood-smeared critic if I didn’t point out the bad as well as the good. Except there are literally thousands of dreadful restaurants I’ve never told you about. Still, on what must have been a slow news day, this proclamation of mine became an item on BBC2’s Newsnight (in which I didn’t participate because, while I’m not unfamiliar with grandiose gestures, there are limits). It was portrayed as an outbreak of kindness. But really, would you have wanted today’s column to be nine thick gallons of unplugged bile? I had to find somewhere else. Which is why I ended up, 16 hours later, amid the kitsch mock-Tudor beams of this converted changing block. Back in the day malicious teenage boys doubtless whipped each other with wet coiled towels in here, for grim laughs. Now people like me perch on bar stools, or lounge on the terrace by the tennis courts, shovelling away plates of cracking ingredients treated with respect. The space was converted in 2017 by the team behind Casse-Croûte just around the corner, and is so impeccably French, they even have a collection of those garishly coloured ceramic Gallic roosters that would look ludicrous anywhere other than on a marble-top bar like this, as a mark of revolutionary fervour. Not that the food is pushing boundaries. There are cheery sharing dishes cooked on the rotisserie at chunky prices, though each is for two to three people and comes with sides: a whole black leg chicken with roast potatoes and green salad for £42; a lamb shoulder with aubergine caviar, runner beans and jus for £58. We opted instead for all the smaller plates, priced at between £6.50 and £10.50: those tomatoes, dribbled with glugs of peppery olive oil, that classic pâté en croûte, topped by its fat ribbon of savoury jelly the colour of amber, with pickles to cut through it all. There were artichokes “à la grecque”, simmered in a peppercorn-spiked liquor of white wine, olive oil and lemon juice with nutty beans dressed in a coriander pesto. Razor clams were cooked, chopped and returned to their shell with wild mushrooms and spinach, then doused in a reduced liquor of spinach and garlic, the better to be swiped away with chunks of baguette. The nearest thing to exotica was a carpaccio of salt-cured cod, with blackberries and fragments of seeded cracker. We finished with a raspberry mille-feuille, with raspberry sorbet made with the crispest of caramelised pastry, and the finest of fruit. It was so pretty it seemed a shame to put a spoon through it, though not for long. Roasted apricots with apricot ice-cream and ricotta came with granola which didn’t quite convince me that breakfast cereal belongs with lunch. See? It’s still possible to be positive and critical. You will want to know what eating here is like. Tables have been removed to enforce the necessary social distancing and that bar really is hefty, making well-spaced counter dining an option. All waiters wear masks, and there’s no paper because both the food menu and the short wine list are on blackboards. In good weather there is that space outside. It has been thought through. Some suggest that the reopening of restaurants is too risky; that the low paid will be forced to work against their will. There will always be terrible employers, just as there were before Covid-19. But everyone I’ve spoken to so far has expressed enthusiasm about returning to work. In the end it comes down to a risk assessment and, even as a 50-plus male carrying enough extra timber to make a Viking long boat, the risk – both to myself and to others – seems reasonable. There is a balance to be struck between the health impacts of the virus and those of lockdown. Right now, that balance leans towards restaurants being open, though it may change. I want the restaurant sector to survive. That means going to them. For now, that’s what I shall do. I’ll keep my fingers crossed they’re all as comely as Pique-Nique. News bites The charity Hospitality Action has launched an innovative ‘invisible chips’ campaign to raise funds for people in the restaurant business, suffering financially because of the current crisis. The campaign, fronted by Fred Sirieix, Heston Blumenthal and Tom Kerridge, invites diners to add a portion of fat-free, calorie-free, non-existent chips to their order, with all proceeds going to the charity. BrewDog is among the first companies to sign up, putting invisible chips on their menu at £3.95. Those who are not yet going out to eat but wish to contribute, and restaurants who want to sign up to the campaign, can do so at invisiblechips.org.uk. The Japanese noodle restaurant group Shoryu Ramen has launched the DIY Shoryu Ramen Kit, available for delivery across much of the UK. Each kit, which serves two, contains 12-hour tonkotsu soup, noodles and bbq pork belly, alongside ginger, spring onions and mushrooms, as well as detailed instructions. It costs £20 and is available to order from japancentre.com. For the same price you can get the Summertime Picnic Pack from the Cheddar Gorge Cheese Company. Each pack contains a hunk of their cave-matured traditional cheddar, another flavoured with cider, garlic and chives, plus Cornish sea salt biscuits, cheese straws, red onion marmalade and chilli jam. For sake of doubt you do not need to go on a picnic to eat this. You can also eat it at home. Order from cheddaronline.co.uk.

It’s time to grow up,” my Greek friend said as we dined on Sophialaan, Amsterdam. The woman has no truck with my moist-eyed lament for the beloved bloc and the financial joys of the Eurozone. Fittingly, we’re eating in Ron Gastrobar, where the owner also turned his back on an important institution. Ron Blaauw closed his fancy, two-Michelin-starred, eponymously titled restaurant in 2013, then reinvented it as a more relaxed and groovy affair. Ron is all about fun these days. Think gastropub, but in a wine bar. It’s a gastrobar! The website shows him chipping about on his moped, stubble-strewn and crumpled-looking, like an unrested Peter Hook. This is not a man pinned down by formality. Just eat your crisp veal brain with jerusalem artichoke and hang loose. Or your cream of cod liver with sea vegetables. Or kale gnocchi with smoked oyster. Yes, I know none of these sounds remotely chilled out. Sadly for Blaauw – or happily; I’m not really sure which at this stage – Michelin gave his new, cosier place a star, so even on a wet Wednesday night in February, the place is so noisy, I can barely hear myself mewling about the patchy quality of the UK’s Eurovision entry. “Pah! No one ever votes for you at Eurovision anyway,” the Greek laughs while fishing very good chilli-infused cornichons out of a jar and slathering warm bread with whipped butter. I am finding all this unfettered truth less than gentle on the stomach. An irrefutable truth: Amsterdam is lots of fun to eat around right now. Over the past year, I’ve been to Mr Porter, part chic cocktail lounge, part rustic steakhouse, and I’ve returned a few times to The Duchess, a giddily elegant dining hall within the former KAS Bank, which I recommend highly. The bento boxes at Momo are fantastic. I’ve even fallen a little in love with Albert Heijn supermarkets (a sort of hybrid of Planet Organic and your local Spar) and their bars of Tony’s Chocolonely chocolate and bizarrely realistic vegan fish sandwiches. Even the Eurostar that goes direct from St Pancras to Centraal station has a menu by Raymond Blanc. Whether I’d return to Ron Gastrobar, however, is debatable. We ride roughshod through the small plates menu, eating one of those dinners where the next morning my most resounding memory is of foams, broths, quenelles and perilously small portions. All romantically lit and with bright, pleasant service, true, but we leave hungry. A minuscule cubic stack of duck liver and smoked eel is certainly earthy, as well as pretty to look at, but really not for sharing, as our servers insist. The same goes for “The Original” spare ribs, topped with crispy sauerkraut and a good, jammy sambol, which are the size of a child’s hand. Dutch cauliflower pleases me greatly – fine-quality florets sauteed to golden in brown butter and slathered with Pierre Robert cheese and winter truffle. OK, it’s millionaire’s cauliflower cheese, and at €25 for a few forkfuls, you might find yourself hoping for a lottery win. One single king crab taco to share, intricately assembled with jalapeño and shellfish butter, sits in a taco stand looking as easy to negotiate as frictionless trade outside a customs union. We order a large, delicious, barbecued turbot that comes with a bowl of “Frietboutique” fries, a namecheck for a chain of Instagram-generation chip shops owned by two sylph-like blondes called Sammy and Pebbles. These women have never eaten a bag of batter scraps in their life. In eschewing formality, the Ron Gastrobar concept is hilariously lopsided. “Anjou pigeon royal” for €42.50 sits on the menu beside a dessert called – and the idea still makes me shriek – “Ron’s Ice Cream Bucket”. It’s a bucket of ice-cream! The menu really does use exclamation marks! The menu suggests you order a delicate glass of sauternes to sip with your trough; I order a cheese plate: some Stichelton, Bleu des Causses and Petit Livarot that were clearly portioned up by someone from a catering college in Lilliput. The Breton cake, kouign-amann, is as wonderful as layer after layer of the fattiest, buttery, sugary pastry drenched in pineapple caramel with salted caramel ice-cream sounds. Still, I fell out of dinner feeling that I’d turned up full of good will, spent a fortune and not had much for my money. “Exactly like Brussels,” the Greek said. I was hungry, far from home and wriggling in the grip of reason. • Ron Gastrobar Sophialaan 55, 1075 BP Amsterdam, 020 496 1943. Open all week, noon-2.30pm, 5.30-10.30pm.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(291,'2020-07-24T09:00:11Z','The Clarence Tavern, London N16: ''It feels ever so slightly like old times'' – restaurant review | Grace Dent on restaurants','When The Clarence Tavern opened in early March – fresh lick of paint, restaurateurs of fine repute, interesting menu – it lasted four whole days before Boris Johnson told everyone to stop going to pubs. So they shut again. When some creative mind eventually pens Britain 2020: The Musical for the Edinburgh Fringe, it should focus around The Clarence as the perfect parable of Britain’s ongoing fightback. The Clarence in Stoke Newington, north London, was once Steptoe’s in the 1980s, where, if I crimped my fringe and wore lipstick, they’d serve me halves of lager. Since then, it’s been The Daniel Defoe, The Clarence (again) and the Stoke Newington Tea House (though still, confusingly, serving beer), before reverting to its original name, registered in 1860. This feels apt: the pub had survived equally as frightening things as Covid-19 and managed to stay upright and serve ale. And, yes, now it’s serving potted shrimp with gooseberries, and farinata with sweet and sour aubergine, too, because times must also change. At this point in the musical, an elderly regular from the Steptoe’s era would stumble in to honk through a plaintive torch song entitled What The F*** is Farinata? “I come here for a pint and a quiet hour,” he’d sing, “now you’re serving me yuppie pancakes made from chickpea flour.” Seriously, I’ve had time to think about this; I don’t get out a lot these days. The evening menu is a single sheet of thoughtful, certainly-better-than-pub-grub options. Borlotti beans with fresh tomato and tuna. A tangle of green bean fritters with sharp, pickled walnut ketchup. Bavette steak with watercress. A heavenly, creamy gratin dauphinois that costs £8 and will take eight months to rid from my bum cheeks. This is still very much a boozer: service is polite, casual, and certainly not silver, floors are stripped, tables are sparsely set, there’s a neat, scrubbed outdoor terrace, and the clientele are aged from seven to 70. The Clarence is a sibling pub to The Anchor &amp; Hope in Waterloo and Canton Arms in Stockwell, as well as The Magdalen Arms in Oxford, all places that took a central part in crafting the unofficial rulebook of the modern gastropub. It’s perhaps little wonder, then, that an evening here gave me a fresh lease of life. We stayed for more than three hours, and lingered over rhubarb bellinis, many extra plates of chips and the light slander of mutual enemies. It felt ever so slightly like old times. Perhaps this was due to it being my third time of dining with the same faces, and by now we’d burned out on the subjects of fear, woe and inconvenience. We’d already navigated such awkward matters as whether or not it was the done thing to share starters or whether it was permissible to nudge each other playfully mid-sentence. Instead, we drank white rioja, argued over whether gooseberry goes with shrimp – I say yes, it is clever and nouvelle – and tried to work out what the tangle of herbs was over the top of my aubergine farinata. It turned out to be dill and coriander, incidentally, with pine nuts. No vegetarian will leave The Clarence and claim their option was tasteless and done to death. This was a somersault of flavour. Please do try, if you go, the peach and brown butter tart, which is all the right kinds of sweet, moist and summery. Though it’s more flan than tart, if I were picky, and my empty plate would suggest quite the opposite. I used to think that I was the least cuddly person ever, but now I find dinners without hello and goodbye hugs quite brutal. Prickly me, I realise, is a fallacy. I long to bear-hug friends, grab their ears, tweak their noses, shove a spoon in their half-eaten trifles. I didn’t do any of that at this particular meal, but there were definitely oceans of laughter. The Clarence Tavern had the worst grand opening imaginable. Its second attempt is worth singing about. • The Clarence Tavern 102 Stoke Newington Church Street, London N16. Open lunch, Wed-Sun, noon-2.30pm (3pm Sat, 5pm Sun), dinner Tues-Sun, 5pm-10pm.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(296,'2020-06-26T11:00:03Z','''We’''ll have to learn to slurp spaghetti without splashing our fellow diners with Covid'' | Grace Dent on restaurants','While I was loitering in an alley and eating chips from Toffs in Muswell Hill earlier this week, before spending an hour on a cold, stone wall outside a pub – just asking for piles, my gran would say – I realised that the current half-and-half world of going out would have suited the 16-year-old me right down to the ground. Me now, though, not so much. But back when someone simply owning a car, usually a Ford Fiesta XR2i, was seen as thrilling, I’d have loved that “eating out” meant sitting in a car park and looking at a wall. I’m much fussier now. As the government begins to let us out, softly softly, while hoping to boost the economy, it has possibly not bargained on how lukewarm many of us still are about even leaving the house. The chips were wonderful, by the way, and I was thrilled to see Toffs back open again after its co-owner, George Georgiou, passed away from coronavirus in April. There was a queue twirling down the street from 4pm, which was a lovely sight, but the guidelines on dining have been confused – never mind 1m or 2m: could we share tables with who we like, or did we have to stay in our “bubbles”? Should older people wear ribbons? This new world hasn’t been quite as good as simply not bothering. Since lockdown, I have been through my time of railing against my robbed freedom, but then I began cultivating rhododendrons, studying the Stuart dynasty, padding around the house bra-less and letting my toe hair grow wispy. Work-wise, I have started filming for TV shows by receiving a camera delivered by courier, setting it up and filming myself looking human only from the waist up, which is all a bit Davros from Doctor Who. Hell, I’m even growing cut-and-come-again lettuce and no one is wanging on about Glastonbury. And none of this is too shabby. Then, in late May, I rushed out of the house and punched the air to celebrate the fact that the new world was finally starting. I stood in some queues for shops, inhaled a traffic jam, watched a few park revellers piss in the bushes, then I went back indoors again. It’s nice in here. Going out when you’re young, nubile and want to hook up is understandable, but the next stage of finishing lockdown should involve Boris and Rishi visiting each and every Generation X household individually to convince us why we need to go back outside. One thing that may lure folk out is the tentative plan to turn Britain’s town centres into pedestrianised eating zones. Fans of alfresco dining will be delighted to know that London’s West End is sealing off some roads so the restaurants can flood out on to the street in order to maintain safer distances while we slurp our spaghetti in a way that does not splash our fellow diners with Covid. Where London goes, other cities will hopefully follow, and this will certainly please some people. All friendship groups divide into two halves: moody ex-goths who don’t mind summer lunch indoors while sipping ice-cold pastis with damp backs-of-knees; and those Club Tropicana types who call ahead to jostle for the one terrace table that’s in direct sunlight and from which you’ll be lucky to leave with any skin left on your shoulders. I gave up eating outdoors in London in the 1990s, when it became impossible to eat at an outside table without a small gang of buskers turning up to play a rousing chorus of La Bamba on their accordions while you waved off hornets with the menu. Still, I’m thrilled by any positive news about restaurants at all. When even esteemed, seemingly rock-steady institutions such as The Ledbury and Le Caprice are shutting up shop, it all feels a bit like the ravens leaving the Tower of London. Each week I hear of places quietly giving up the ghost. Also, although I am cosy indoors, the thought of closed roads, street-party vibes and slightly stuffy restaurants bending their normal strict rules of neat decorum seems gloriously debauched. In fact, it sounds continental in a way we decided we didn’t want to be in the Brexit referendum. I may even shave my toes.','https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jun/26/we-ll-have-to-learn-to-slurp-spaghetti-without-splashing-our-fellow-diners-with-covid-grace-dent-restaurants','Grace Dent','''We’''ll have to learn to slurp spaghetti without splashing our fellow diners with Covid'' | Grace Dent on restaurants',-2.45438910000000021,54.2776946999999907,0.421499999999999985);

Max only got away with sending me all the additional messages because of a certain self-deprecating charm. He kept apologising while also not shutting up, which is a neat trick if you can pull it off. He was trying to do something a little different, he said: serving game he’d shot himself on the hills of Northumberland without banging on about it on the menu, in case that made those people who don’t like to be reminded that meat comes from living things, all frothy and uncomfortable. There was a bit of foraging, too, he said, but he didn’t bang on about that either, because he knew it could be annoying. In his restaurant, he said, it was all about the daily specials. And so, if I ever happened to be passing, might I? Two years on, I have. Some people find the idea of shooting game reprehensible. Where it’s merely for sport I agree. Shooting living things as a way, say, of compensating for small genitalia is sad. But if you have a problem with game being shot solely for the table, then stop reading now. Go to the gardening column. You’ll be happier there, and I don’t want you to be sad on a Sunday morning. The rest of you, stay. Gott really is trying to do something a little different. Italy, Spain and France are full of restaurants like this, cheerily throwing on to the table whatever used to wander about outside; the UK, not so much. Where they do exist here, they tend to be self-conscious country pubs, with the whiff of dung on the doorstep. Bistro 46 is in Jesmond, where students and academics cluster together for warmth. From the outside it looks like the kind of place that should be knocking out beetroot and goat’s cheese salads, steaks and crème brûlées. On the inside it looks like that, too, save for a boar’s head on one wall and a shotgun high on the other. But instead of the beetroot thing, there are pheasant bonbons: spiced and seasoned balls of minced loveliness, lightly breaded and deep fried, and served on a mess of burnt leeks with, on the top, finely shredded puffball. Gott has a way with pheasant. He manages to make it taste of something. Too many cooks don’t. Unless it’s been hung for so long there are maggots setting up home in its arse and picking out Ikea furniture for the living room, it’s frankly rather bland. And if it is hung for that long, it tastes only of autopsy and death. He pulls off the same trick in a special of a pheasant scotch egg, the minced bird spun through with wholegrain mustard. The yolk is at that perfect place between set and running. On the side is some of his mum’s fruity chutney. Partridge breast comes sliced alongside chorizo, new potatoes and a Jerusalem artichoke purée, the whole dressed with crisped greens and a dribble of meaty jus, plus deep-fried shredded potato. They like a bit of detail at Bistro 46. Mostly what they like is feeding people. The kitchen seems incapable of pronouncing the words “small portions” let alone serving them. Like the Great Wall of China, these are dishes that would be visible from space. From the all-important specials board there is a heaving dish of “Kerr honey-glazed short rib, artichoke and hand-cut chips”. Later, Gott emails again to tell me: “Kerr is the guy who I stalk with, but who also keeps bees.” He emails once more to tell me that they get their vegetables in large volume and use them all up, hence a lot of artichoke at the moment, puréed, roasted and so on. He emails a third time to say he used to put all this information on his menu “but it was a longer read than my dissertation”. Obviously, I want him to stop typing but, despite myself, I’m rather enjoying the narrative. We have venison, deep rosy slices of the stuff, with impeccable mash, a few roasted veg, some greens and a deep, luscious cep sauce. Oh, and another pheasant bonbons, just because. It comes with a knife fashioned from a deer antler, which came in turn from an animal that made it on to the plate. Nothing goes to waste. We are also given a glass of cloudy cider made from apples scrumped from the streets of Jesmond, because all proper trees are theft. It’s crisp and dry and delicious. The instinct to largesse doesn’t always work. A side dish of “loaded fries” is advertised as coming with braised pheasant – there really is an awful lot of pheasant around at the moment – with parmesan and chives. The fries have gone soggy under the thick plug of cheese and ground meat. Charred sprouts with pancetta are much better. Not that we finish them. We are but two men, and there’s food on this table for four. That’s how they roll in Newcastle. Judge them, not me. Desserts are a friendly bayonet pointed at the chest, demanding cheery surrender. If you wanted something light and refreshing, you’re in the wrong room. There’s a crumble made with more scrumped apples, with the obligatory frothy custard, and a very fudgy brownie in a pond of caramel sauce, with a big thick quenelle of cream. Look, it’s cold outside. It took me a while to get to Bistro 46, but I’m very pleased I made it. From everything I’ve described you could conclude it’s distinguished by the whole field to fork thing, and obviously there is that. But much more important than any of the ingredient-sourcing, is the mood. This is a small restaurant with heart. It’s run by a group of enthusiasts who are determined to win over their customers by knocking out plate after plate of the things they love. It’s both utterly mad and completely delightful. News bites The Game Bird at London’s Stafford Hotel is much grander than Bistro 46, but they share an interest. The British grill room menu – there’s that fine pea and ham soup, London Particular to start, with the promise of steamed steak and ale suet pudding to follow – also has a game section. It could be roast pigeon, or a whole stuffed partridge with bread sauce and game chips (thestaffordlondon.com). Thackeray’s in Tunbridge Wells is running a five course ‘honesty menu’ through until March, which will be available to 20 diners from Tuesday to Friday evening. Customers will be asked to pay what they think the meal was worth. According to owner and executive head chef Richard Phillips the team ‘wanted to try something truly innovative in 2020. This definitely isn’t a test. It’s a treat.’ The menu will change nightly (thackerays-restaurant.co.uk). Help is at hand if you’re thinking of kicking the booze this month: BrewDog has announced the launch of its first ‘alcohol free’ bar, on London’s Old Street. It will stock 15 low or 0% abv craft beers. They insist it’s not a pop-up but ‘a pilot concept bar’. Which is a phrase the English language has been waiting for (brewdog.com).

Pretentious takes many shapes in the eye of the annoyed. It can mean stiff, formal and “reet up itself” to the point of joylessness. That, I’m not a fan of. Life is far too short. Pretentious, can, however, also mean eccentric, incomprehensible, wilfully weird and wholly unique. I like this type of purposeful bewilderment much more; it makes life feel much longer and fuller. I could watch people ranting about why Tracey Emin’s bed is not art all day long; or why Bang Bang It’s Reeves And Mortimer isn’t funny. When my glorious reign begins, the national anthem will be Kate Bush’s 26-minute conceptual piece The Ninth Wave, in which she screams her way through a sea rescue featuring helicopters and an Irish jig. In this vein, I also had much openness for Aikens’ Muse, a small, odd, bolshy but emotionally fragile new opening in Belgravia, London, with exorbitant prices; you even have to wire a £200 deposit to them before your booking is honoured. The word doing the heavy lifting there is “deposit”: dinner for two – 10 courses, with a cocktail and a couple of glasses of wine each – will easily come in at £400-plus. Muse has 25 seats, and a handful of kitchen crew and front-of-house. The decor is the meeting point between a Mad Hatter’s womb-like retreat, an Israeli art-deco boutique hotel and a community centre climbing wall. When I arrived slightly early, I peered through the downstairs window into the lounge area to see Aikens himself, the first guest at his own house party, standing there alone. Feeling invasive, I retreated to the pub next door to kill time. From the outset, Aikens offered no precise menu for Muse. This was catnip to critics, and we longed, despite ourselves, to know what his “experience-led” journey inspired by “nostalgia and pivotal moments” was really about. And when we learned that the menu was not remotely a menu at all, but more a collection of, well, musings, with courses given titles such as “Conquering the Beech Tree [below]. My first memory as a child was a sense of fearlessness; I was always taking risks and looking for challenges. We had a very tall and beautiful copper beech tree in our garden that I would climb again and again. As chefs, we must always challenge ourselves”… Well, at that point, a great clucking and flapping broke out. The food world genuflects all day long at the brooding yesteryear bonkersness of Marco Pierre White, and then someone such as Aikens dares to be that type of wild-eyed, self-absorbed iconoclast and onlookers very much don’t like it. If he had opened a place called Mooch and charged 200 quid for peelings he’d scrounged out of a bin to save the planet, this level of goody-two-shoes madness would be received rapturously. Still, after the initial blowback over his “concept”, Aikens relented and added tiny descriptions to his “menu”. Thus, beneath that beech tree paragraph it now reads “(langoustine, pork fat, burnt apple)”. This gives very little away of the dish actually being langoustine tail braised deliciously in armagnac and served with rosemary-infused apple, langoustine custard and a ragout of fennel and artichoke. Oh, plus a little pop-up book with a beech tree. “Neither Black nor White” is a glorious riff on cauliflower panna cotta, served with cauliflower ice-cream and pickled gold raisins, verjus and caviar. “Cows and Cornflakes” is a trip to Auvergne to drink fresh, rich cow’s milk with cereal; the dish is malty and popcorn-strewn. Dissecting each dish in print feels churlish; Muse should be a surprise. One needs to feel the odd sensation of Aikens wandering over to the table to deliver performance art set-pieces on his mother’s love of pickling, his unruly love of fire or his wayward childhood on the muddy flats of the north Norfolk coast. Few people are less suited than Tom Aikens to wearing their hearts on their sleeves, five times nightly, before absolute strangers. His compulsion, his arch determination to do this feels like being part of 10 courses of delicious talking therapy, or a Marina Abramović installation. Muse is a cathartic rumination on life with canapes of milk cured with chestnut cream, tiny cep tarts and London’s best homemade bread with chicken butter. I was less of a diner, more of an in-patient. Muse is pretentious, yes, but it’s the sort of pretentious I live for.

EH7 5AA (0131 322 1246). Lunchtime à la carte: starters £8-£14; mains £16-£25; desserts £5; wines from £29. Set lunch £25. Evening tasting menus £50 and £70 The Lookout is a brave restaurant. It hasn’t so much decided that passing trade is not a priority, as laughed in its face, then handed it a scribbled note saying, “Go away.” It occupies a new build right at the top of Calton Hill within the Observatory buildings, looking out over Edinburgh to the Firth of Forth, hence the name. Inside, it is drop-dead, look-at-me-I’m-Instagram-ready gorgeous, with floor-to-ceiling glass walls, polished concrete floors, a light well through a geometric funnel of a ceiling and an open kitchen with a fire grill, guaranteed to give any diners sitting within 10ft a nice cure. Outside it is toilet-block chic. It’s apparently been designed by an architect who, when asked for a contemporary design that might have something to say to the neoclassicism of the faux Athenian Acropolis that dominates up here, decided on the words, “Yeah, whatever.” Taxis can drop off, though it’s still a walk from the road. Otherwise, it’s a major yomp uphill because there’s no parking. No one would describe it as a model of accessibility. On a beautiful Edinburgh summer’s day when the sun barely bothers to set, this could be joyous. I go on a late November day, when half the North Sea is being deposited on the hilltop. I feel intrepid simply for getting to the door. There is one other challenge. In the evenings, like its sister restaurant, the Gardener’s Cottage at the bottom of the hill, it only serves a tasting menu. It’s £50 for five courses and £70 for seven. There’s quite a lot of this in Edinburgh right now. They do something similar at Timberyard and Six by Nico, the Table and Aizle and a few others beside. If they’re finding enough custom happy to have what they’re given, then good for them. But too often a tasting menu feels to me like double maths, only with fancy glasses and better-dressed teachers. It’s to be endured. And then paid for. That is the case for the prosecution. Here then is the defence: at lunchtime, when it’s a short à la carte, the Lookout is worth busting your lungs for. The view is spectacular, even when the cloud-base is descending on the city like a duvet being chucked over a bed, but you won’t look up much because the food is so diverting. It is simple ideas, well executed, using great ingredients in the service of big flavours. Across our lunch everything feels thoughtful and thought out. Three fat rock oysters arrive. One is in a crisp, lacy tempura overcoat. The other two are unadorned, but come with a shell generously filled with their own XO sauce. It’s a deep rust colour, and rich with the profound savouriness of dried seafood and sugar and oils. I know I’m meant to put it on the oysters, and I do, but I also end up spooning it away neat, until I’m scraping at the mother-of-pearl. They come with a well-made sourdough and lick-the-plate-clean butter. There are just four choices for the first two courses. The star of our starters is a cuttlefish risotto made night-black from the ink. On top are the very freshest of cockles still in the shell, which are salty and sweet and bright. Cockles are the equal of any poulard clam, but most of them get ripped from their shells, pickled and sent away to people with more taste. We suck at the meat then use the shells to scoop away. There are a few bitter leaves on top wilting gently in the heat. By comparison a frothy bowl of pumpkin soup, the surface sprinkled with pumpkin seeds, seems almost demure. But glancing up at the rain slapping the glass like a cat demanding to be let in, this soup suddenly makes it feel as if the food and weather have been matched. Bouncing around in the bottom of the bowl are squeaky, fresh beechnuts. Both of these dishes are £8. It’s a lot for the soup, and very good value for the risotto. A chunk of pearly hake, the flakes sliding away from each other, sits atop an unmanicured mess of gently sautéed leeks, nutty new potatoes and melon-bellied mussels, which are a warming shade of tangerine. It is described as coming with “curry”, which in this case means the puddle of buttery broth bringing it all together has been spiced lightly with a garam masala. The darkness to this lightness is a perfectly grilled and glazed beef fillet, with roasted and charcoal-grilled pieces of Jerusalem artichoke. There’s also a jug of a luscious onion broth to pour over it all. We have been sniffing all this on the air for so long now it’s almost a relief to be eating it – for, while major extraction has been fitted, it really isn’t up to the job. Occasionally, they try opening the front door to let a little of the smoke out, but the weather is determined and angry. Get a table as near to a window as possible. Alongside, we have grilled and blackened hispi cabbage – I love acrylamide, me; no really, I do – with dollops of Berkswell cheese, and more cheese grated over the top, plus pink fir potatoes still in their skins, first fried then roasted. Remember, this is Edinburgh on a dreich day. You will need something to sustain you on the trip down the hill. We finish with a slab of apple tart, made with chunks of fruit roasted to golden, and a whipped chocolate mousse, with booze-soaked prunes and a chocolate tuile. It’s not uncommon for strangers to tell me how jealous they are of what I do for a living. I tell them it’s a writing job not an eating job, and so on. But reading this back, even I’m jealous of me. Of course, there is a price, which is not helped by a short wine list that opens at £29 for a bottle of Moscatel and doesn’t loiter for long in the £30s. Two glasses of admittedly terrific Albariño come in at £27. With mains around the £20 mark the bill will build up quickly, though there is a no-choice three-course set lunch from Monday to Friday for £25. Think of it as high-altitude dining, with prices to match. And be prepared to put all your clothes in the wash the moment you get home. Taken in the round, however, I’d put it all in the column headed “Absolutely worth it.” News bites It also takes effort to get to the Moorcock Inn, high on the moor at Sowerby Bridge, but it will be rewarded. Chef Alisdair Brooke-Taylor and his partner Aimee Turford, who runs front of house, walk the line between generous boozer and cutting-edge restaurant. The pub menu might include baked sea bass or a game terrine with pickles; the restaurant tasting menu, a snip at £39 for nine dishes each, heads off towards crab with creamed corn and fermented mushrooms and celeriac with goat ricotta (themoorcock.co.uk). The top 100 UK restaurant list, compiled by the crowd-sourced guide Harden’s from their contributor’s reports, makes interesting reading. 10% of them are Indian, Kent is the strongest county in the UK, and the North West makes the strongest showing after the South East (hardens.com). While some high street chains are finding the going tough, others are prospering. Pizza chain Franco Manca, which started as a single outlet in South London, has reported half year revenues up 9% to £36 million. David Page, chairman of parent company Fulham Shore, says they have identified 40 UK towns and cities for openings over the next five years, which would bring the total to 90 sites.

Small plates £6-£8, mains £14-£32.50, desserts £7-£8, and wines from £24 Sunshine. That’s what stays in the memory after lunch at the Gallivant, a small hotel and restaurant by Camber Sands in Rye. Lots of sunshine. It’s not simply that the sun is literally shining when the taxi drops us there, although it is – a pale, milky sunlight of the sort you find close to the sea in winter. It is the whitewashed dining room itself, with its slat-board panelling and, framed under glass, myriad swimsuits attesting to the glorious variety of the human form. There are rubber plants and blond wood floorboards. Last week, at the Seabird, high above London’s Blackfriars Road, a similar design felt like an affectation, one seemingly conceived by someone who had only ever seen a child’s drawing of a beach house, perhaps while coming round from an anaesthetic. Obviously, the Gallivant is no less thought out. The current dining room is a new addition from 2018. A mood board was probably involved. It may have come complete with shots of tousle-haired blond children in sand dunes, of the sort Boden likes to use to flog its wrap dresses. In its low-key way it’s all gloriously aspirational. A yoga class is finishing up in the space behind the dining room as we arrive. I feel virtuous merely for walking past it. Later, I leave the Gallivant certain I want to be the me in that dining room all the time. I think it works because here there really is an embarrassment of beach. It’s one we never see because we are far too interested in our lunch – a succession of rugged, big-thighed dishes, the appeal of which often disguises the care that has gone into them. On my computer I have a file listing restaurants I should consider for review; places I think will both show me a good time and give me something to write about. Some go on the list and come off again within weeks, because I’ve dived in at the first opportunity. Others are there so long they’ve closed before I’ve got anywhere near them. And then there are places like the Gallivant that have been staring at me literally for years. New chefs have come and gone and I’ve never quite made it. Late last year they announced the appointment of another chef, Jamie Guy, formerly group head chef for Mark Hix. At last, with cause to be in Rye, I had a good reason to visit. I’m glad I did. Guy’s cooking carries the fat thumb print of his time with Hix. It’s unfussy and extremely satisfying. Behold: whelk fritters. Whelks have an image problem. They sound less like food than something you need to get lasered off an intimate area. As in, sotto voce: “I’ve just had my whelks removed.” They often have a chewability problem, too, courtesy of over-cooking. It’s why we send most of ours to Korea. They know how to treat them well. Here, the umami-tastic molluscs are chopped up, mixed in with a batter and deep fried. Alongside is a coarse-chopped tartare sauce. It’s a very good start. Guy has a smart way of using seafood as a flavouring. Half a hispi cabbage is grilled and drenched with a mussel butter, which sounds like a cheery thing to do to almost any ingredient. There’s a crumb of crisped bacon across the top. It’s a humble hispi in a bespoke suit. Jerusalem artichokes are roasted until almost toffee-like and laid across a thick surf of whipped goat’s cheese with the funky farmyard whiff that only goaty things can deliver. Both plates are £7. The main course menu is dominated by choices cooked on an open wood fire. The eye-rolling cynic in me wants to whine about how the industrial revolution was actually a great idea when it comes to the drudgery of cookery; how I love electric ovens and gas rings because they’re so easy to control, and do we all really want to retreat into playing fantasy caveman by burning twigs? Then again, if a cook knows what they’re doing, food cooked over wood can be stupidly lovely. Here, there’s whole turbot, or a pork chop with capers and sage, or cauliflower with chickpeas and a curried purée. Or there’s what I have for a mildly extravagant £22: sturdy lamb chops from animals that have literally patrolled the waterfront down on the nearby Romney Marsh. They are curled up on themselves like edible commas, the fat crisped, the meat pink. There is a bright, acidic ribbon of green sauce streaking across the plate. Elsewhere, a beef cheek has been braised until ready to fall apart with a nudge. It is glazed with a glossy jus. Alongside, lubricated by more of the sauce, is a mess of fermented barley. It’s risotto’s grown-up cousin; the one that’s developed a liquor habit and started watching filthy movies. It’s serious and dark. To stop the whole thing becoming a crashing, savoury bore, there’s a big hit of fresh horseradish grated over the top. We have greens on the side because we are good people who care about our bodies. The desserts make me think they need to employ a pastry chef, or at least someone who can bake, for they are basically creamy things. That said, they are very good creamy things. Rhubarb, the bright pink that only the forced variety can deliver, is stewed and served with a scoop of a thick baked custard with a crust of caramelised sugar. There’s a very dark chocolate mousse with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream and sugared hazelnuts. Alternatively, try the local cheese: the Burwash Rose, the Ashmore or the Kentish Blue. That commitment to locality is reflected in the wine list, which has a long selection of English wines with notes on the distance from where we are sitting to the winery, the closest being just 10 miles away. A few years ago, this would have been grandstanding over quality. It’s still a bit of an affectation. Few of these homegrown bottles are immediately affordable. You’ll still have to look to the Spanish and French section for that. But the quality is definitely there. A glass of Hush Heath Pinot Blanc-Chardonnay is gentle and soft. As is the cheery service, which knows when to be there and when to stay away. I sip a mint tea as the winter sunlight drains from the sky, and give thanks I finally made it to the Gallivant in Rye. That’s one I can tick off the list, and very happily so. News bites Elsewhere in Rye, I have a jolly late supper at the Standard Inn, from an eclectic menu designed to help soak up the beer. Local scallops are grilled on the shell with garlic butter. There’s spiced potted Dungeness crab, a very well-made chicken liver parfait and, slightly randomly, some properly messy Korean chicken wings. Random they may be; welcome they are (thestandardinnrye.co.uk). The AA, which has been handing out rosettes to British restaurants since the 1950s, has told those with one or two rosettes that they will now have to pay £180 to be included in the AA Guide. Those that are up to the standard but decline to pay will not be included. The change affects standalone restaurants, rather than those in hotels, which already pay under a variety of other schemes. Following news that Marlon Abela’s Michelin-starred Mayfair restaurant The Square was shut down recently by administrators during lunch service, the two Michelin-starred Japanese restaurant Umu has also now gone into administration. Likewise, Abela’s nearby members club Morton’s has also ceased trading. It’s a remarkable turnaround. In the early naughties Abela, the scion of a wealthy Lebanese family with a fortune from mass catering, was said to be worth nine figures.

She pauses like a school teacher waiting for me to fill in the gap. I say nothing, being not in the mood for a test. She changes tack: “Do you know about our concept?” “Yes,” I reply. “And how did you find out?” she asks. “From a magazine,” I say with my lips tight around my teeth. The real answer is that Silo has been so loud, righteous and holy in the run-up to its London opening that anyone with even a smattering of curiosity in the food scene is aware that it’s here. Chef Douglas McMaster and his disciples are, they say, “providing quality through purity” in Hackney Wick with a zero-waste restaurant that serves a six-course tasting menu. The details of dinner are beamed across an entire wall via projector, so saving on paper menus: blood radish cannelloni, charred red artichokes in blue cheese sauce, braised Friesian cow, squash, potato and pumpkin ice-cream … “We don’t do à la carte, so we can control what we need,” our server explains, and then proceeds to explain many other things on top, despite me having not asked any questions. Silo sits in a large, gorgeously lit loft with a large sit-up bar and about 10 tables, and is upstairs from Crate Brewery, where, for reference, you can get a decent pizza and a beer, and no one tells you anything at all. Up at Silo, meanwhile, loud hip-hop, jazz and spoken-word poetry plays over doubtlessly ethically sourced speakers. Almost everything else about the place, however, feels like a 1985 Tomorrow’s World segment on “How we’ll eat out in the future”, in which Judith Hann shows us Silo’s magnetic table made out of recycled plastic packaging with the cutlery hidden within, and its aerobic digester, which is capable of turning 60kg of organic waste into compost, overnight. Mind you, I don’t have a clue what she’d make of the very burnt artichokes and the non-intervention wines that do not taste remotely of wine, yet can still get you so drunk, they’d numb the grief after all your loved ones had been squashed by a killer asteroid. It’s commonplace in the restaurant world right now to be very, very ashamed of food waste, carbon footprints and, for that matter, the ethics of experiencing luxury at all. Silo suggests that, in the future, going out for dinner will be so little fun that eating corned beef in your bunker will be a lot more entertaining anyhow. Then again, Silo is the perfect place to hold a client lunch or to take people you don’t want to talk to, so you can all coo over distracting ideas such as Empirical Spirits’ drinks at £7 a glass, which are sort-of-cocktails but served as wine and made with a liquid that’s not based on any known spirit. I think the technical term for this kind of thing used to be “moonshine”. With every course, a server arrives, calls you “folks”, kneels down, proffers a tiny sliver of radish with a small fart of hemp cheese goo inside, before talking you through the lifespan of the radish and the seasonings and the puddle of glop in which it sits and all the minuscule stages of its cooking process, plus the flavour notes of which you need to be aware. If you’re in the mood for this kind of thing, you’ll love the place. Two charred artichokes – and by charred, I mean they resembled something you’d find in the remains of your house after a fire – sit in a Stichelton cheese sauce with a vividly red ruby kraut. They’ve been caramelised over fire before being plunged into coals to get that blackened exterior. The small amount of flesh inside is sweet and fudgy, but the skin is bitter and tastes, unsurprisingly, of fire. The small piece of braised Friesian bull is delivered with a soliloquy on its various life stages, its noble death, and the machine Doug owns that turns an unappetising cut into something edible. It’s a piece of meat extracted from between the ribs, and comes from a wing of the dairy industry that’s not usually consumed – enjoy the course. A tiny suggestion of pumpkin ice-cream is, however, delicious. There are chefs all over Britain, in rural pubs and tiny cafes, who are making a stiff effort to grow their own vegetables, source kindly, re-use and recycle, and who love the planet, but they’re doing so with a fraction of the fuss and po-facedness of Silo.

Memories | Grace Dent','Christmas dinner, when you’re the one cooking it, is an oddly spiritual gesture. It’s not just roast meat and spuds on a plate, like any other Sunday. It may look just like it, give or take a blob of cranberry, but Christmas dinner is imbued with memories. Oh, and hopes, dreams, love and loss, too. All the good, emotionally churning stuff that pairs well with a glass of brandy. When I’m shelling sprouts on Christmas Eve, to Keeping The Dream Alive by Freiheit on Radio 2, putting each stubby bullet in a pan of cold water, my mind will wander over at least 10 previous dinners. My fierce Cumberland grandmother, long gone and so very missed, blasting sprouts to mulch in an old-school pressure cooker. The year I and my ex-husband learned that pancetta, cream, pepper and a casserole pot transformed sprouts from also-ran side dish into crowd-pleasing sensation. We actually ran out of sprouts before roast potatoes that year. At our house, a packet of Colman’s bread sauce must always be bought, despite it having no real fans. It will be plonked on the table last of all, stirred in a Pyrex jug as a panicked afterthought, in wonky memory of long-departed great aunts and uncles. “I don’t even like bread sauce,” we’ll mutter as each one of us dutifully takes a few spoons of the largely unlovable, beige paste. “Oh, remember Aunty Beat? She loved it. Wouldn’t eat turkey without it. Used to drive us mad.” It’s perfectly easy to make a British Christmas dinner for the very first time, even if you’re not a remotely skilled cook. Just shove a dead bird in the oven and serve it with winter veg such as parsnips, though try not to mention, if you’re French, say (as my other half is), that panais is fit only for horse feed. Or if you feel, as he does, that even making gravy is admitting in advance that all your vegetables are going to be dry. I’m not sure, though, that the big meal tastes remotely the same without a whole lot of family history. A colleague told me recently that her Sri Lankan family spent their first Christmas Eve in the UK bickering in a soon-to-close Sainsbury’s about what even constituted a British Christmas dinner. They were panic-buying gravy granules and enjoying some earthy, passive-aggressive, sibling-based sniping over who’d be lumbered with cooking the bloody thing anyway. My heart leapt: it was their first British Christmas, and I couldn’t help but think they’d absolutely nailed it. Not least because, unbeknownst to them, they were making magical yuletide memories. “Remember the fight we had over brandy butter in Sainsbury’s in 2018? When I stormed off to Costa and you sulked in the car?” They could now gleefully remind each other of it over each and every spoon of brandy butter for ever more. Hosanna in excelsis! When I’m stuffing my hand up a bird, retrieving giblets, or arranging the pigs in blankets, I enjoy every little Dent family memory, but that doesn’t stop me dreaming of a more perfect, refined, stress-free dinner. In the future, in 2040, say, I aspire to have an elegant Christmas on my almost-too-enormous country estate. Think Penelope Keith in To The Manor Born, when she finally marries Richard and gets her house back, combined with a touch of 1982 Princess Margaret at Sandringham. Dinner will arrive under a variety of cloches, the table setting will be tasteful, there will be enough chairs so no one has to sit on a foldable seat with a beer holder that was last used at Glastonbury. There will also be no turkey. We’ll eat nut roast stuffed with macadamia, pecan and pistachio, so I don’t have another poor turkey on my conscience. In my dream, my family will accept this graciously, without quibble. No one will burp or bicker or bring up the 2040 version of Brexit. I will not peel or chop anything myself, yet I’ll appear occasionally before guests in an apron, looking fragrant and unruffled. My husband, who will be an elderly, yet still smoking-hot Morten Harket from A-Ha, will entertain us over pudding with a moving acoustic version of Hunting High and Low. Post-dinner, we’ll play erudite parlour games while drinking fine armagnac. It will not be like other Christmases, where the Dents lie about from 5pm, incapacitated by sherry trifle and slagging off the new Quality Street (so small! So not as good as we remember!!), while still gobbling down an entire plastic box, toffee fingers and all, and watching the high-jinks of the Emmerdale Christmas special. Or maybe I won’t change a thing in the future. I love our perfectly imperfect Dent Christmas. We’ve honed how this day works for decades, so why spoil a winning formula?','https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/dec/06/grace-dent-the-dream-of-a-more-perfect-refined-stress-free-christmas-dinner','Grace Dent','The magical ingredient in my Christmas dinner?

Back then, my father was stationed at Aldershot Garrison, roughly 11 miles cross-country from this newly re-loved, rather gargantuan pub formerly known as The Mayford Arms. Whenever I pass though this part of England, I think of 70s treats: a Lyons Maid Zoom lolly slurped at Farnborough airshow, Bird’s trifle for the Silver Jubilee buffet and a bag of Frazzles while watching Shaw Taylor on Police Five. This is not, to my memory, a part of the world where cods’ tongues, celeriac fritters or cuttlefish bolognese feature on any “pub grub” menu; or cockerel with gizzard sauce or kid goat rack, for that matter. But The Drumming Snipe is a very modern type of gastropub, doing everything that large pubs in out-of-the-way locations have to do these days to thrive. In its previous guise, the place plodded on for decades through many management teams and a fairly recent battle with locals bickering over noise levels: some thought the large beer garden was too noisy, others thought the complaints were nonsense. Whatever, in 2020, it takes a stiff nerve to take on pubs such as these and make them future-facing, community-centred and at the same time vaguely profitable. Happily, when I popped in for a midweek lunch during its opening month, this bright, shiny and rather classy new venture was bustling. Seldom do things bustle at lunchtime, especially out here, but there’s lots to like about The Drumming Snipe, so it figures. Here we have a seriously thought-out menu ripe with good-quality produce, an exec chef who can namecheck The Ivy Club, enough space for family Sunday lunches and warm service from manager James Lyon-Shaw. The menu is ambitious, very, very meaty, sometimes wobbly and occasionally raw. There are jellied hocks with piccalilli, Brixham scallops, White Park steak tartare and lambs’ tongues; but there are also burgers, steaks and shepherd’s pie for people like your Auntie Brenda who don’t hold with offal. I sat in the newly painted, echoey conservatory next to one of those amazing couples who give their toddler a tambourine to smash on the table throughout lunch and then become irate when other guests give up trying to talk to each other and ask to move, as did one poor elderly lady, who spent her soup course frantically trying to reset her hearing aid. “’Eeees only a lickle baby,” the child’s mother howled again and again as I poured a large glass of numbing Longue Roche merlot directly down my gullet. But that’s the dilemma with family pubs: all ages must play nicely together. Or play tambourines together. Smash, smash, smash. Yes, I will have another glass. No, I am not siding with her. Oh phew, here’s lunch! Starters of hot, crisp celeriac fritters – think tiny, knobbly bhajis with an earthy crunch – came with punchy piccalilli. Then excellent and accomplished beef shin croquettes. Both turned up on pretty, costly but stone-cold cast-iron platters that should really have been warm from the oven; nor should the truffle mayo with the croquettes have had a film. It’s tiny touches such as this that elevate a meal from boozer to restaurant. That said, another starter of jerusalem artichoke soup with a Quicke’s cheddar toastie was a work of decadent majesty that contained enough thigh-cladding butter, cream and cheese to survive a Russian winter. Cod tongues and cheeks on toast, however, was the fishiest thing ever to be put before me. So much so that I could feel my eyelashes wilting. The staff advised Charles that the “Butcher’s Plate” mixed grill was actually for two people, but he was not deterred. He endures my meat-free nonsense on a near-daily basis, and here was a chance to eat grilled goat chops, cockerel thigh, piles of Longhorn beef skirt, Portland lamb leg and “trencher”, which is the fatty, carby joy that occurs when pieces of sourdough bread are laid under a huge plate of meat to collect their juices. The whole Hägar the Horrible smörgåsbord arrives with triple-cooked chips, king cabbage with hazelnuts, dripping bearnaise and stilton hollandaise. Nothing is remotely underdone, and errs on the traditional, slightly cremated British way of enjoying meat, but it’s a feast nevertheless, and one that will put the pub on the local map. The rhubarb crumble featured that drab type of fragile, biscuity topping, but there wasn’t much of it anyhow, and the crumble:fruit ratio should always be half and half. At this rate, I probably won’t go back to Woking until 2066, and by then I’ll be in my 90s. I shall try to remember to switch off my hearing aid. • The Drumming Snipe Guildford Road, Mayford, Surrey, 01483 610010.

They won’t thank me for telling you that, though. People enjoying a low-key, Saturday mooch in the gloriously preserved, tastefully re-loved Leeds Kirkgate Market, and stopping for a quick beer and plate of Lindisfarne oysters at The Owl, do not wish for a million cool-hunters from down south. Those ambling among the food stalls, eating a thali tray from Manjit’s Kitchen or an Istanbul-style fish butty from Mr Mackerel don’t need an influx of TikTok stars making lip-sync videos by the yorkshire pudding wrap stall. That’s a real thing, by the way: slow-roast beef, fried onion and gravy wrapped in a large, flat, carb-heaven pudding. My knee-jerk reaction to news that Leeds folk were wrapping their breakfast bacon and eggs and fried tomato in a Sunday lunch accoutrement was that this lawless mayhem must be quashed. But, having seen the joy it brings, my policy has taken a U-turn. Kirkgate Market is a joyful thing, and an unusual one. Old-school butchers and fishmongers, clothes stalls and spice vendors live happily side by side with Vietnamese banh mi sellers, a florist and a woman who sells knitting wool. It’s not easy in Britain – in fact, some would say it’s impossible – to keep old Victorian covered market halls intact, alive and moving onwards. These vast, echoey, cold spaces are steeped in history, jam-packed with experts in their field, but selling stuff we’ve now learned to order mindlessly online. Use them or lose them. We’ll be gutted when they’ve all gone. So when I heard some months back that chefs Liz Cottam and Mark Owens had plans to repurpose a patch of the bottom of Butcher’s Row and open a pub called The Owl – the first pub inside the market for 150 years – it felt fantastically ballsy. I watched a video of Cottam, a former MasterChef contestant who went on to open Home in Leeds, as she scooted around the market, casing out the space and brightly informing the elder statesman of the stalls that she was coming to open a bar, take fresh oysters, crab, boar and pheasant off them, serve it with nice wine and make it a destination. Her business partner Owens, who has cooked at Le Gavroche and was head chef at formerly Michelin-starred The Box Tree in Ilkley, would make the likes of fish pie, rabbit suet pudding, game wellington and roasted nut and forest loaf. “Yer bloody mad,” one stallholder laughed as Cottam described her vision. It was a common theme. She hadn’t even mentioned that this could be described as fine dining, or that she was serving champagne, which was just as well, because that might have finished them off. Something about Cottam’s upbeat, relentlessly charming brass neck had me rooting for The Owl to take flight. Because she was bloody mad, but she bloody did it, too. The Owl is an inconspicuous slice skimmed discreetly from one side of Fish and Game Row. It’s painted black. The door and signage isn’t immediately apparent; I walked past twice. Inside, it is dimly lit, in a cosy way, with an open kitchen, a scattering of tables and a bar one can sit at and enjoy Lindisfarne, Irish or Kumanoto oysters, or perhaps king scallop and parsnip soup with fresh crusty bread. Or braised game sausage rolls with mash, followed by a bowl of cherry crumble with vanilla custard. They open at 8.30am and do omelette Arnold Bennett and a four-cheese sourdough stack with Gentleman’s Relish pickle. They play a soothing blend of ska and reggae and the service is faultless. I manoeuvred myself into The Owl with no booking, at lunchtime, by sheer fluke, because it is mobbed at weekends – and rightfully so, because it’s uniquely marvellous. Cool, yes, but not too cool. And fancy, definitely, but still proper food. Just casually delicious. Mussels cooked delicately in white wine come with warm bread. Steamed dumplings are fat, thick, soft-skinned, slightly sweet clumps of joy filled with well-seasoned boar and venison or an earthy stew of mixed wild mushrooms, and served on a bed of buttered root mash and deep-scented gravy. Lemon drizzle pudding turns out to be two thick slices of shortbread sandwiched with wonderfully abrasive lemon ice-cream, tastebud-tasering Sicilian lemon curd and some thankfully balm-like white chocolate. It was lunchtime, I was alone in Yorkshire and in that merrily unfortunate position of wanting to carry on ranging along the menu, but being thoroughly incapacitated by rich, remorseless gluts of fat, sugar and two glasses of champagne. In fact, I was so full, I could no longer truly feel my feet. Never mind, owl be back. • The Owl Fish and Game Row, Leeds Kirkgate LS2, Open Mon-Sat 8.30am-5.30pm (10pm Fri &amp; Sat).

Some people on the frontline are not unbusy at all. Others found their actual jobs merely replaced with three or four other unpaid roles for which, until three weeks ago, they had no training. “Who knew,” said no sane person ever, “that being a full-time GCSE coach, short-order chef and Skype-based amateur social worker, all at once, could be so much fun?!” Big shouts going out to all the WFH crew necking 4pm shots of last-resort Pedro Ximénez straight from a fuzzy-rimmed bottle that has moved house six times, but that now tastes like sweet nectar. Still, although some of us lucky ones’ jobs have changed rather than stopped, I do find myself with more time. Largely because tons of utterly pointless, life-robbing faff has been snatched away. Until recently, I wasted hours each week commuting on the Central line in London, my limbs and digits retracted into a space minute enough to pass the EasyJet carry-on baggage test. No more of that, for now. Grooming was another huge time thief, my being of an age when time spent preparing to be seen in public far outweighs the length of time spent out of the house. Being sexy is an arduous task, involving several layers of sand and cement, some boob hoisting, tweezering, and two good goings-over with a lint roller. Knackering. I won those hours back this week, and spent them watching all six hours of Wolf Hall, while eating slices of Nigella’s onion supper pie (a Domestic Goddess recipe that will save your soul) and caressing my lovely Patti Smith moustache. Covid-19 has steamrollered over so much, taken loved ones, ruined livelihoods, leaving a weird, bittersweet backwash of diaries emptying of chaff; the meetings about meetings before the proper meeting, the catch-up drinks already cancelled twice, the team-building day, the school run, the quick scoot to the shop for six eggs and a birthday card, the terrifying corporate Glee Club performance and, for all these things, the donning of actual pants and shoes beforehand. Still, like countless thousands of others right now, I am isolated from many people I’d give anything simply to hang out with. This open-ended separation feels often unbearable. The thought that some may never be seen alive again, and no meaningful funeral permitted, is, well, let’s not even linger there. Feelings are not facts, I mumble, letting the blackness come and go. Or banishing the gloom by batch-cooking lentil dal and deciphering the fast cooking techniques on my five-year-old Sage fast/slow cooker. Woooooh, steam! I lie about for hours, letting the cats use me as heated furniture, re-learning all the two-letter bridging words in Scrabble. And above all, I tell myself over and over, this has been only three short weeks and I am fortunate. Recently, I’ve thought many times about my much-loved, acerbic grandmother, long since dead in 1993 but, in light of events, now all the more intriguing. During the second world war, my grandad was away for the best part of six years. She was alone, in the middle of nowhere, with one daughter (my mother), a sharp mind, a slightly lame leg and pernicious anaemia. He was not big on writing letters. She had, of course, no telephone or television. She did have a wireless, but it played only once or twice a week, my mother says, in order to eke out the battery. I think of them both every evening as I climb into bed at the end of another weird day. “What did you both do for six years?” I’ve asked my mother on the phone several times recently, self-pitying my own drab lot; just sat here alone with my Netflix and Britbox and Zoom and Sky Q and WhatsApp. Will nobody think of my struggle? “She was always doing laundry,” Mam says, struggling to remember. “Or baking, if she could get eggs. Oh, and she sometimes played gin rummy.” “How did folk not go mad?” I ask. “Well, some folk might have done, but we didn’t,” she replies, as if mental health is a modern notion. “How did you get eggs? I thought they were rationed?” I ask. “Oh, you had to secretly swap them for bread crusts with a farmer, so he could feed his chickens,” she says, as if this is obvious. “One of you had to pretend to be going on holiday and set off on the bus with the crusts in a suitcase.” Our chats, now that we have the time, never fail to surprise me. “And don’t even ask how we used to get bacon chops,” she adds. “It’s not for the squeamish.” I’m leaving that tale for Week Four of lockdown.','https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/10/big-shouts-going-out-to-all-the-wfh-crew-necking-4pm-shots-of-sherry-grace-dent','Grace Dent','Big shouts going out to all the WFH crew necking 4pm shots of sherry | Grace Dent',-2.45438910000000021,54.2776946999999907,0.421499999999999985);

E-scooters for hire have arrived in the city centre, which is terrific fun for everyone: riders, pedestrians and road-users alike. Who doesn’t love palpable chaos and an incessant moving backdrop of near-death collisions? I know I do. Or at least, I learned to live with them. However, I genuinely do love authentic, modern-facing Spanish restaurants, showcasing simple, ancient Basque and Galician techniques and exemplary local produce, which is why I was away from my sofa and 50 miles down the M11 in search of one of those Nieves Barragán Mochacho-style gooey-centred heavenly tortillas that defy home replication, or even some simple but meaningful pan con tomate or a bowl of judiciously balanced fideua. Because my prior impressions of Mercado Central seemed to say it was this type of place: set within a beautiful old Cambridge townhouse, its outer brickwork painted navy blue, with an elegant upstairs dining room and, on the lower floor, an open kitchen. By God, I wish I’d insisted on being seated upstairs. Instead we sat downstairs, in what I read later on the website was a bar area; this despite having booked a table many, many moons ago. Our seats backed on to an echoey, empty fireplace where the fire extinguisher lived, near to the footfall of the front door, adjacent to the hectic open kitchen where serving staff buzzed about without direction or left to smoke cigarettes. In order to be heard by your dining companion, you needed to shout, and thus everyone in the room was shouting. The remedy for this seemed to me to be a large, stiff Mercado lemon verbena gin and tonic. Perhaps then, I figured, the din and disorder would start feeling like a hazy night in Palma de Mallorca, wandering around the old town’s backstreets, chancing upon that family-run, slapdash, no-frills grill that transpires to be the shining pinnacle of your holiday. I necked the gin and lip-read our server as she filled us in on all the delicious items on the brief menu that were no longer available as they’d sold out. “Queen scallops and gambas al ajillo … are off the menu,” she said, in the manner of Jim Bowen pointlessly showing me a speedboat. We ordered a plate of cecina de Wagyu &amp; Cebon, a cured meat from Leon, and the Arzua cheese and piquillo pepper croquetas. The croquetas were Wotsit-orange and perfectly edible, albeit one-note in flavour and not terrifically crispy. The cecina was fine, but it was sliced cold meat on a plate so they’d not had much input. A plate of white asparagus with lemon mayonnaise was both waterlogged and mushy and the crispy squid had been deep-fried until it was nigh-cremated. By this point, we’d spent around £60, eaten little and were still waiting for something delicious, but I was in no mind to give them £85 for a Tomahawk steak. Instead, I tried the baby leeks (slightly stewed), parsley, chopped egg and anchovy (singular, it was literally one very good anchovy cut into pieces.) “Perhaps we can go off-menu and ask them for a plate of these anchovies. They actually taste of something,” shouted Charles. “No, we can’t,” I shouted back. “Only dickheads order off-menu.” Charles, being French, finds this attitude incredibly British. Instead, I ordered tarta de limon, hoping for something delicate, dense and zinging with Valencian groves, set serenely within buttery shortcrust. I received a warm piece of lacklustre garden-centre-cafe lemon meringue pie. At this point, the chef plodded past to go for his cigarette, too. El Bulli this is not. And here lies the problem with this new breed of fancy, pricey, British yet apparently “Spanish” restaurant, which says: “You’re not in a tacky tapas place now – don’t go expecting chunks of Lidl chorizo fried in port or mystery meatballs or Julio Iglesias’ Begin the Beguine on the stereo. Have you not been to London’s Barrafina or Sabor or that Quique Dacosta joint where they charge you nearly £100 for a small, charred prawn paella? We’re like that! We’re fancy people here! Bring your credit card. Let us educate you.” Because when all that ambition falls flat, all you’re left with is a hefty bill, tinnitus and a craving for a humble plate of substandard patatas bravas. Mercado Central is a beautiful building with, on the ground floor, the makings of a pleasant place to drink vermouth or sangria. With more careful, generous cooking it could represent Spain beautifully, but right now it’s firmly in the red zone. • Mercado Central, 24 Green Street, Cambridge, 01223 502392.

The only constant has been working out what to eat | Grace Dent','“Seventy-two baps, Connie – you slice, I’ll spread,” said Victoria Wood, denoting the arch stoicism of a British woman facing the enormity of death. It’s a line I’ve loved nearly all my life, not least because it reminds me of big ladies in smock dresses at Dent family funerals in the 1980s. Up at dawn to make a tipsy cake, then turn two pounds of chicken breast “coronation” via the application of curry powder and jam, and wave off the corpse. I’d like to say that “Connie slicing baps” has been my personality throughout lockdown thus far, but that’s not the full story. Perhaps, like me, your Covid-19 crisis persona shifts through several gears each and every hour, from calm to terrified to brave to depressed to jolly, via gallows humour and so on. The only constant has been working out what to eat at a time when many ingredients we once took for granted are scarce. In my most Connie moments, I’m frankly far too busy for Covid-19. Cook, cook, cook. Bleach this, sterilise that. I’ve got the Magimix out for the first time in years, trying to do a rudimentary banana bread with strong flour, having not found, during this war, the correct GI to have sex with in order to procure a 1kg bag of self-raising. The judder of the blades pulverising sweetly decaying bananas drowns out morbid thoughts about my friends potentially dying in the vast Whittington Hospital down the road. It also nulls the thoughts of my other half’s much-loved rabbi dying suddenly last weekend, after appearing unwell in shul and then quickly gone, or my brother’s friend with Parkinson’s dying in intensive care. The silver lining to this – glimmering ever so weakly – is that I have not wasted those decaying bananas. Oh no. Bananas ticked off my list. For my next trick I will be making a cheering set of scones using the wrong flour and a box of Trex cooking fat that predates Siobhán’s first time in the Sugababes. “How are you doing?” my friends ask each other constantly on WhatsApp, checking in, our friendship meaning more than it ever has before. In my case, it depends on when you ask me. Yesterday, I was in my Covid-19 mode where I would be played by Nicola Walker: subdued, bubblingly furious, underslept with eyes that have seen so much, breakfasting and lunching on Maxwell House sachets stolen from hotel rooms and Nutella out of the jar with a dessert spoon, all while trying to weigh up what will kill one of my family members first: the lack of chemo or the Covid-19 they catch while having it? This decision feels above my pay grade. Where can I buy a hazmat suit online? “Can we drive them to the front door wrapped in clingfilm, and I’ll sit in the boot?” I suggest to my brother at one point. It felt, in that moment, a reasonable question. Afterwards, I had freezer-bread toast and cracked open my emergency raspberry jam. My favourite lockdown persona, which I save especially for supermarkets, is Tina Turner as Aunty Entity in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. Sure, this dystopian world is upon us, but I will survive. I’ll be pivotal in Earth’s rebuilding, as well as glamorous and Amazonian. Asda is my Bartertown; if I move before dawn, under cover of darkness, I can stock up on couscous and even hand sanitiser. My most nauseating lockdown hours, meanwhile, are the ones I spend channelling Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop newsletter, because, like, if you think about it, maybe Covid-19 is, like, a chance to totally emotionally recentre and focus on nourishment and healing. During this time, I listen to my Tara Brach “radical acceptance” guided meditations while shredding cauliflower leaves before sauteeing them with shallot and carrot, adding a handful of barley and simmering in low-sodium Marigold vegetable bouillon. Immunity is so important. “Jesus Christ, it’s a good job you’re self-isolating alone,” one friend says. “Maybe sleep with a window ajar.” Because of my other half’s high-risk job, we are apart for the foreseeable, but then many people all over the world right now are in peculiar situations. Homes split, mealtimes fractured. Alone, apart, but also, at the same time, together. On last night’s Zoom chat, an anniversary, he was sitting in his pants after work, eating some godforsaken cut of an animal he’d found in his freezer, drinking a beer and listening to the awful, trumpet-heavy jazz that he likes and that I loathe because it makes me feel as if I’m being chased by bees. He was planning on watching a Jason Statham movie. “Are you missing me?” I asked. “Yes,” he replied, “I am having a terrible time.” “This could go on for months,” I said. “I know,” he said, a small flicker of bliss dancing about his lips. We’re all in a dire situation. But look out for those silver linings.','https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/03/how-am-i-coping-the-only-constant-has-been-working-out-what-to-eat','Grace Dent','How am I coping?

The docks are where Londoners end up after bumbling around aimlessly with guests from out of town who wanted to see the famous bridge and gaze at the tower and turrets, and who, having stood on the bridge in a sideways gale, now fancy something to eat. That’s when St Katherine Docks – with its pretty marina full of swanky yachts, buggy-friendly walkways and wide choice of restaurants – feels like a great idea. But it’s not when you inevitably end up in Côte, Zizzi or Café Rouge. Or, for that matter, in Ping Pong, Strada or any number of several other local restaurants that are really just locations to be taken by a partner during the painful run-up to a judicial separation. Luring actual Londoners to St Katharine Dock is no mean feat, then, which is why the first 11 times I mentioned The Melusine to my other half, Charles, he made a face as if I’d suggested we join the queue at Madame Tussauds to see the George Clooney waxwork that looks like a large melting pillar candle. But the Melusine, I felt strongly, had bags of promise. When its Greek chef Theodore Kyriakou opened Livebait way back in 1995, the joint was hot, hyped and swamped by media bigwigs, especially at lunchtime, yet at the same time it was also wonderful. Just a pared-back, reliable haven on The Cut near The Old Vic in Waterloo that sold oyster platters, Dover sole, sprats and posh fish and chips. No fuss, little pretension. Soon after, Kyriakou sold the concept and left the company, only for the new owners to fritter away all Livebait’s goodwill incrementally as they tried to roll it out into a chain. Kyriakou moved on first to The Real Greek and later The Greek Larder, where he worked with manager Wade Mundford. At The Melusine, the pair have again joined forces for a small, self-effacing fish restaurant that, in their words, “embraces unpredictability”. The Melusine’s menu shifts with the tides. On offer the day we went were fresh rock and native oysters, cherrystone clams, whopping langoustines off the plancha and mussels with wild mushrooms and lovage. Their supplier, Pesky Fish, cycles supplies of whatever has come in fresh that day to their door. “We’ve got a plaice,” our server informed us. “It’s a big one, though – 700 grams – and it came in from the Channel today from a fisherman called Dean. It comes with a caper and red pepper dressing, and it’s probably for two people.” That felt like a gauntlet being chucked down, not least because Charles is a man who is rarely happier than when covered in a makeshift bib, boning, skinning and extracting the fleshy pockets from a fish so large that, under fairer circumstances, it would have eaten him. While we awaited the monster, we shared some small plates: a pungent, excellent taramasalata strewn with black sesame seeds and alongside a generous array of confit purple and yellow carrots (left), which, with the good sourdough bread, would have been an excellent supper on their own. I did not expect any of the small dishes to be so laboured over, but with each one, I am pleasantly surprised. A plate of fresh, crisp squid comes with “cold-smoked rump”, the menu informs me, and before ordering I have to double-check that this means “rump” as in cow, rather than some new term the food cognoscenti have snuck in while I was asleep. Those giant langoustines turn up with a fiery, jalapeño aïoli, while the battered rock oysters are topped with lamb prosciutto. The plaice itself is delicious; its buttery, caper-heavy dressing elevating it with great aplomb. Pudding is blue cheese ice-cream, the sort of dessert I call “compelling”, which you stick with despite yourself, because blue cheese shouldn’t ever be made into pudding – but oh, the bowl is empty, and there we are. This was, quite simply, a great midweek dinner in a simply furnished and decorated room – save for the enormous stencil of a skate across one wall – and with no flamboyant airs or graces. It’s a small kitchen turning out magic, with Kyriakou leading the way in the manner of a man whom I read later on was a merchant navy officer for 20 years. When the icebergs melt and we’re all running to the lifeboats, I want to live out the great thaw on whatever ship he’s cooking on. • The Melusine Unit K, Ivory House, St Katharine Docks, London E1, 020-7702 2976.

I’d stuff down three courses, in London, Leeds or Liverpool, kip like a Kardashian in a Premier Inn bed, feast lavishly on its 7am tureen of simmering tinned mushrooms, then write up the adventure on the train home. You’d reply telling me that the restaurant was too far away, too pretentious, too pricey, and that my prose was like damp fog and that you’d never read me again. We did this week in, week out. It was brilliant. I genuinely miss what we had. I miss proper restaurants desperately. I even miss the war of attrition that is a 15-course tasting menu starring yeast fragments, wood ants and pickled bracken, served with tales of the chef’s childhood and capped off by a digestif of Fernet-Branca, which tastes of bin juice. The UK restaurant scene, pre-Covid, was exhausting and endlessly silly; but it was also robust and alive and forever entertaining. But as I looked at Attawa’s menu online, I started wondering whether I should do the 10-mile round trip to collect, and worrying if delicious things available in Dalston are something you really want to read about. Presently, the UK dining scene is delicate. There are haves, there are have-nots. In the far north, where my family are, there’s no delivery restaurant food or takeaway; snaring an Asda online slot is still a nocturnal game of wits. Millions are still in the “long stare into the freezer and busking it with couscous” stage of lockdown. Meanwhile, the Mayfair restaurant and oligarch’s playpen Novikov, I’m informed, is offering to deliver king crab leg gratinated with wasabi cream to your private jet on the runway. For £70, excluding delivery. It’s the type of green shoot of hospitality recovery that might make Lemmy stir from his grave and re-record Motörhead’s Eat The Rich. London is currently awash with fancy places pivoting to build-your-own-signature-dish hubs, where, for about £100 and provided you live within five miles of Covent Garden, you can unpack your own confit duck breast and pommes aligot from a sea of plastic, arrange it wonkily on a plate and regain a fresh appreciation for sous-chefs and catering colleges. Attawa is the next stage of the comeback. Just as life erupted, MasterChef: The Professionals 2019 semi-finalist Arbinder Dugal was about to open a bricks-and-mortar sit-down spot named after the owners’ home village in north India and serving handed-down recipes. I spent Friday perusing the menu of Punjabi chicken kari, dal makani, pindhi chole and tandoor roti, and felt unable to resist. I’ve eaten my own dal for months: it tastes like a wet weekend in Bognor. How do they do it at Attawa? And, let it be said, it’s ballsy in the extreme to open anywhere new right now. Good for them, I say. Anyone who hopes to turn a profit in summer 2020 has had seriously to scratch their heads. How can the sums work now that chefs are beholden to Just Eat and Deliveroo surcharges? How can customers collect food when British traffic wardens are some of the world’s most enthusiastic? Most importantly, new openings are all about making a great first impression, creating future regular customers with delicate flavours and arch technique. Pretty, complex things such as Dugal’s palak papdi chaat – a dreamlike arrangement of potato, chickpeas and crisp, frittered baby spinach – should probably not be driven miles and spooned straight out of the carton. His fragrant, creamy black dal makani is the stuff of dreams; possibly London’s greatest, most pacifying use of lentils. It wasn’t ideal that I had to reheat them in the microwave or that the delicate, homespun roti was ever-so-slightly past its best. When Dugal sketched out the Amritsar khatta ladoo – fluffy, fried lentil dumplings on sweet relish and carrot – he possibly did not envisage them being eaten, 14 hours later, by a northern woman in her dressing gown reaching into the fridge. Yet Attawa was worth leaving the house for. These warriors at the forefront of the UK dining comeback – use them or lose them. None of this is perfect, but we don’t have time to wait for that. • Attawa 6 Kingsland High Street, London E8, 020-7254 1236. Open (for takeaways only currently) Weds-Sun 5-10pm.

How unfair to air my feelings about the gum-chewing miscreant at reception who chivvied us in with all the grace of a meat-raffle caller on an oil rig. Or the surly servers who rolled their eyes at my request to move somewhere less draughty. Or the food – specifically, the overcooked pappardelle with its weak, forgettable, busking version of oxtail ragu. Lina Stores had been open for only seven days, after all, and launching a 100-seater Italian – and one that’s open from dawn to dusk seven days a week – for the bunfight of tourists and families who head each day to Pancras Square is no task for the meek. This largely pedestrianised, multipurpose space now boasts dozens of restaurants, boutiques and businesses. Change in footfall has come rapidly. The multi-floored Dishoom outpost at the other end of Stable Street is often a one-in, one-out affair, while the door staff at family-friendly antipodean brunch spot Caravan on nearby Granary Square are masters of crowd control. It’s no mystery why the chain restaurants – albeit the very cool ones such as those two and the imminent Hoppers and Bao – have moved in. Lina Stores, on the other hand, has always been something of a curiosity. Known primarily as a delicatessen on Soho’s Brewer Street since 1944, its name trades on homespun, straight-outta-Genova authenticity. Chefs adore the place; it’s all so real. Lina’s iconic, emerald-green tiles are beset by piles of lavishly wrapped panettone, panforte and torrone. If Jamie Oliver still tormented London on that scooter of his, seeking out “pukka produce” as he did in the 90s, the original shop is the sort of place he’d go to grapple with slabs of taleggio before riding off with a rucksack full of prosciutto San Daniele to a soundtrack of Dodgy’s Staying Out For The Summer. But it’s the year 2020 and, cashing in on all that goodwill, Lina Stores has now shifted its unique, bespoke loveliness first to a restaurant around the corner on Greek Street, though at least that’s still Soho, and now to this whopping great space two miles away. The new Lina Stores is undeniably beautiful. It’s a cool, retro, mint-green diner with a lavish sit-up bar where I was fully intending to fritter away next August, smouldering away like Sophia Loren in Black Orchid and making my way dutifully down the vermouth-based cocktail list while my editor made churlish noises about my P45. But it is not to be. The second time I visit, the floor staff are indeed all different. I walk in without a reservation and am given a place at the bar close to an open kitchen door and overlooking the person laying out the antipasti. It offers many clues as to why nothing is delicious. Triangle cuts of fried polenta and roast mushroom sit waiting to be assembled. The polenta is overcooked by any sane standards, yet seems destined to be lukewarm by the time it reaches any table. Aubergine polpette are small patties of unlovable mulch that have been shoved into hot oil for at least a minute too long, until they taste of little except the frying pan. Good, salty anchovies turn up on rectangular slices of semi-stale brioche. “Charred heirloom tomatoes” are exactly that: not particularly moist any more, or even cooked until sweet or soft; just charred. Pane alle olive, featuring succulent, whole green olives, however, is very good. The pasta is disappointing, just as it was on my first visit. How can 30-egg yolk tagliolini with vacche brune parmigiano, butter and black truffle be anything other than heaven? When it’s overcooked and the sauce stingy, that’s how. Orecchiette with lamb sausage, cime di rapa and chilli could have been any cooked mince with an Oxo stock cube chucked into the mix. Most of this is forgivable if a place is jolly, but yet again, the mood of the staff was a war of attrition against the public. They had opened this beautiful restaurant – a bigger version of their chic Soho one that’s mainly favoured by the cognoscenti and chefs resting their chafed bits on Mondays – and now this bloody rabble are here from 8am to midnight every day, with their nans and kids to boot, and it’s not remotely fun. The mains I ordered were forgotten, so after waiting 30 minutes and then being asked if I wanted the bill, I tasted something far better than Lina’s pasta: freedom. I grabbed it readily. I shall carry on going to the one in Soho. Sometimes, smaller really is better. • Lina Stores King’s Cross 20 Stable Street, London N1, 020-8103 4787.

In fact, this was the only part of Project Fear that didn’t make me fearful. Because there are few things nicer than ambling hungry into a sweet, vinegar-scented chip shop to find the fryer bubbling, chips being methodically shovelled on to paper and a glass-fronted warmer cabinet rammed with mystery items decked out in batter. That shape, for example, could be a burger, while that one might be a black pudding. And that’s definitely a fish. But who cares? It’s all hot right now, ready to be smothered in vinegar, pelted with salt and served with a generous stack of chips. Some people swear by chips straight from the fryer, but I think chip-shop chips benefit from being carried, still wrapped, for two or three streets, allowing the surface area of each chip to soften slightly, the malt vinegar to permeate and your mind mentally to begin eating them at least six times. Then, the moment the paper’s unwrapped, one should begin involuntary grazing immediately, so that by the time you eventually sit on a bench to eat, you’re virtually full already. Dan Harding’s Angel Lane Chippie crossed my mind as a shining example of British brilliance, and not merely because there has been a chippie of some sort registered at this address since 1928, nor because the place has won 30 national awards over the past 10 years and is widely considered to be one of the north-west’s best. It’s all the tiny things: the white-on-black peg letterboard that’s there in an entirely non-ironic, non-retro fashion; it’s simply never not been. The jars of pale pickled eggs, the excellent, stodgy mushy peas, the flat cartons of slightly fruity “chip shop curry” (which, in case you’re wondering, people of genteel Britain, should be roughly the shade of Farrow &amp; Ball Dutch Orange) and the fact that sausage comes in the four timeworn genres: “small”, “jumbo”, “cumberland” and “smokey”. Where else can you ask for anything in “jumbo” without blushing? Each time I visit Angel Lane, its stone floor, stainless-steel cabinets and spam fritters whisk me straight back to British chippies in the 1970s, when I struggled on tiptoes to see into the cabinet. It gives me a Brownie uniform, nit nurse and BAGA badges-era sort of Proustian rush back to a time when my biggest concern was finding bric-a-brac for the Blue Peter bring-and-buy. Perhaps everything was better in the olden days, I think each time I size up Angel Lane’s cod, which is always curly, firm-fleshed and clogged with extra globs of thick batter. Or the wodges of homemade cheese-and-onion pie, or sometimes steak, with cartons of “Angels [sic] own gravy”. I mean, yes, back then, of course, we ate cod without giving a flying fig for the oceans, carried our chips home in a cheap plastic bag that we hurled in the bin and flooded the planet with toxic chemicals, and ate them in front of Jim Davidson’s Too Risky on VHS. The good old days do not hold up well to scrutiny, so I’ll stick to discussing the chips. Thankfully, Angel Lane is nostalgic, but it’s also forward-reaching: they’re committed to using haddock and cod that’s sustainably sourced from Iceland and Norway. (In hindsight, we should really have been less rude to Norway about its last Christmas tree gift.) Back in December, incidentally, Angel Lane was flinging battered pigs in blankets into the fryer and serving them with a cranberry dipping sauce. If this taste sensation becomes a supermarket Christmas 2020 novelty item, robbed by every big business food development kitchen, I want you to know that Harding’s team were the trailblazers. On my most recent visit, I went posh and sat in the upstairs restaurant, which is essentially a no-frills seating area, like Nora Batty’s caff in Last of the Summer Wine. They’ll bring you a stainless-steel pot of tea and your fish and chips on a plate with a wedge of lemon, as if you’re Queen Noor of Jordan or something. They’ll do this after a fashion, because they’re also trying to serve the busy shop downstairs. Please don’t go and then moan on TripAdvisor that it isn’t at all shiny and bright and equipped for every need like a Harry Ramsden. Angel Lane is wonky, ancient and doesn’t need changing. We live in bizarre times for our teas right now, and they’re about to get even more fishy. • Angel Lane Chippie 17 Angel Lane, Penrith, Cumbria, 01768 866762.

Starters £1.95-£8.25, mains £9.95-£18.50, desserts £6.50-£7.95, cocktails £6.95-£8 While the East Midlands will not dazzle you with Michelin stars, Northamptonshire, where I live, is a singularly Dark County. We have some terrific food producers and wonderful cooks, but not many restaurants that fulfil their promise, or last long if they do. Is it the traditionally thrifty chapel culture of the towns that grew with the expansion of shoemaking, or the monopolising of fine dining behind the walls of the many great estates here, or a road network connecting easily to fleshpots elsewhere? But then, suddenly, a glittering jewel in a surprising place – June Plum in Wellingborough. The restaurant is in the town centre, on the street which would be Curry Mile, if it were a mile; more like Fenugreek Furlong. You might not notice it at first, between a Polish restaurant and an excellent Indian, but as you can tell from its name and the music playing inside, its origins are Caribbean (June plums are a bit like mangoes and loved by children – sweet, tangy and salted, when they come into season in the summer). Strong, clean flavours that delight are delivered by its chef-patron, Jodi Jenny, who grew up in St Mary, Jamaica, the daughter and granddaughter of cooks. She trained in Miami, and then came to the UK and worked in restaurants around here, posh pub grub at first, but, as she grew in confidence, and in the esteem of her employers, Jamaican food appeared on the menu. Customers so enjoyed it she started Jamrock, a food van, which I first came across parked next to B&amp;Q. Wellingborough made sense because it has a relatively large population with Caribbean heritage, thanks to the Greater London Council’s policy of offering housing outside London to those on its lists in the 60s and 70s. The “overspill”, as it came to be known, was Wellingborough’s Windrush generation and with the arrival of families with origins in Jamaica, St Kitts, Grenada, Antigua and so on, came also an appetite for ackee and goat and plantain and saltfish and Scotch bonnet peppers. With the arrival of Jamrock those of Caribbean origin, like those from Asia a decade before, could connect with home. Jodi found premises in Cambridge Street and after five years or so rebranded Jamrock as June Plum, which caused me some anxious moments searching on Google for what I feared was another fine restaurant that had given up. I sat at a table in the courtyard, as Covid restrictions obliged, with a button I could press to deliver bursts of warmth from the heater overhead, not unwelcome in this chilly May. I scanned the table code to download the menu on to my phone, and as I read, a bowl of complimentary boom shakka lakka popcorn arrived, salty and spicy and still warm, and my customary pint of Red Stripe lager (£4.20). Jodi, who I had not seen for months, came by, too, and we caught up. The restaurant had done a roaring takeaway trade in lockdown, to the immense gratitude of its regular customers, but she likes people, a full restaurant, sociable, community-centred (the reggae nights are very popular). “It’s good to be putting food on plates at last,” she said. My starter, ordered from the vegan menu, was BraDap cauliflower (£5.95), al dente florets dredged in a sauce of Jodi’s own creation, a happy accident involving nearly burnt onions and molasses. It is rich and dark and treacly, sweet but with smoky depths, that complements the faintly bitter vegetable beautifully. Portions are substantial, which works just fine for me, but fainthearts may find one serving sufficient for two as a starter. For my main course I ordered curry goat (£12.50), as good as any I have eaten, the meat tender, and unlike versions I have had in the Caribbean, deboned and degristled. It is marinaded generously in Jodi’s own curry sauce, which is dark and rich with heat and sweetness, and runny so it leaks into the steaming pile of rice and peas which comes on the side, the rice soft and almost sticky, the peas gently releasing their leguminous richness in the mouth. One of the adaptations to local palates is making the degree of heat optional. I like fiery, so I ordered some of Jodi’s own hot relish, Junkanoo Poison (£1.20) on the side, a mysterious pinkish creamy-looking concoction that looks like something you would put on a dessert rather than a curry, but it is deceptively powerful. In a concession to my five-a-day diet I ordered also a side of coleslaw (£3), excitingly purple thanks to one of its components, beetroot, but I could not eat it all so it was boxed up for me to take home. Another couple arrived and were seated two tables away. He was a first timer, she knew her stuff, and had opinions about the correct texture of ackee, and how plantain is proper on one island, green banana on another. Jodi once told me that Caribbean expats are the hardest customers to please, each with their own island variation of a classic dish, and mothers and grandmothers who cooked it just so. Nostalgia is bespoke, and satisfying it an approximation, so rather than go for strict authenticity she has chosen instead to go for what pleases her, what pleases her growing number of loyal customers, and that’s why you see tortillas and quesadillas and burgers, and the best macaroni cheese I have ever tasted, on the menu, too. From the short dessert menu I picked coconut cream pie (£6.95), an open pie of sweet pastry with a rich coconut filling, somewhere between the texture of cheesecake and fondant – not the slimmer’s option, and accompanied by whipped cream. It was all I could do to finish it, and again I would suggest that one pudding between two might be right for those of leaner appetites. I waddled away to the diminishing sound of what I think was Micah Shemaiah, past the Romanian café, the best Indian takeaway in town, and the wonderful supermarket, unmusically called Kaka, where we now can buy saltfish, shito sauce and Alphonso mangoes, in a town where not that long ago you’d be lucky to find an aubergine.

It is also the Japanese word for water, which is something we have in abundance from late September to April, when living here requires tenacity. Daylight appears in ludicrously short bursts, all your clothes are damp, on radiators and/or smell of wet collie, and entertainment comes via observing the frequent rescue of tourists from Helvellyn, and eating. Restaurants, however, can be a problem. I’ll distil decades of lived experience into a small grunt: the reputable, forever-namechecked ones are usually fine-dining, once-in-a-lifetime joints, while the very good, hearty, jolly, family-friendly places are rare and, rightfully, always booked up. Well, either that or they shut at 3.30pm. This leaves a whole lot of substandard, this-will-do-they’re-only-tourists cash pits. The difference in hospitality between the Lakes and the relatively nearby Ribble Valley is notable. Mizu, which opened last year at the Lodore Falls Hotel &amp; Spa, is most certainly plugging a gap in the Lakes, where authentic Japanese, Thai, Malaysian and Korean food is scarce: there are just a handful of Japanese places round these parts, though each town may have a small Cantonese. Temporary visitors won’t mind enjoying Cumberland sausage and Kendal mint cake instead – when in Rome, etc – but after an extended stay, it’s safe to say you will pine for sating, umami-drenched ramen, abrasive wasabi, soothing coconut, chilli, ginger or merely the culinary cuddle found in a handful of ajinomoto (MSG). With its offering of “Asian-inspired” dishes, Mizu is, apparently, the answer to all this. Its chef, Kasun Jayasooriya, worked at the highly reputable Sake No Hana on St James’ Street in London, yet his menu is a far cry from the agadashi nasu tofu and the zeeland yellowtail sashimi served in Mayfair. At Mizu, I order a plate of “Asian sausage”, imagining it to be a welcome rip-off of the rustic, northern Thai banger you get at Ben Chapman’s Kiln, teeming with kaffir lime, coriander root, galangal and lemongrass. Instead, I am sent a plate of pigs in blankets lying in a puddle of sesame sauce. And here all hope evaporates. The “sushi” is largely California rolls containing mayo or cream cheese, and none of it feels freshly, just-that-minute rolled. The menu section marked “sticks” – they mean yakitori – features chunks of sweet potato that give nothing of the grill, as well as prawns and pork belly. Mizu, with its katsu curry, gyoza, bao – just the buns, which you can order as a side – feels a bit like a Wagamama without any of the diligent service one expects from that chain (I took my gang to the branch at Newcastle Metro Centre last month, and we had a complete ball). There is not merely a fault in training at Mizu, but an absolute dearth of it. Other places in the Lakes that position themselves as luxurious include Simon Rogan’s L’Enclume, Forest Side in Grasmere and The Samling in Windermere, and, just for fun, I try to imagine Rogan dealing with everything that occurs at Mizu. We arrive for our 7.45pm table, but there’s no welcome at the door. Eventually, we’re pointed towards the sofas, to wait until they’re ready, “so the kitchen doesn’t get too busy”. Drinks are forgotten, tables go unwiped between courses, and no one seems to know very much about the menu. “Is this caviar?” I ask, pointing at a blob of roe balanced on some radish that comes with the breadcrumbed teriyaki lamb cutlet. “Spicy mayonnaise,” the server says. The “big plates” are better than the sushi and sticks, even if their presentation is flawed. “Steak &amp; tempura” is an 8oz steak half marinated in dashi and half dipped in tempura (ie, battered). It is, quite frankly, bizarre. The lentil sauce in the Sri Lankan parippu fish curry is gorgeous, but a grey piece of pan-fried cod plopped skin side up on a beige sauce will not win any hearts on Instagram. Weirdly, however, Mizu makes an outstanding vanilla creme brulee, with a crunchy top and just the right amount of warm, sweet, pleasing give below its surface. But it also does a chocolate lava cake that claims to feature Japanese umeshu hot chocolate sauce, yet tastes just like a Gü pudding, though on the plus side it would definitely pacify a child. Mizu is a restaurant for visitors from all over the world who are passing through the Lakes, and who will wake up in the morning, open their window and see a lovely mere and a mountain, and think, “Oh, never mind. We’re on holiday.” Plus ça change, plus c’est la même bloody chose. • Mizu Lodore Falls Hotel &amp; Spa, Borrowdale Valley, Keswick, Cumbria, 0800 840 1246. Open all week, noon-2pm, 6-9pm.

Or, in the case of Allegra in Stratford, at the edge of the former Olympic Park, it’s a little like herding fog. Allegra is just six brief minutes by rail from King’s Cross St Pancras – just take the Javelin train one stop through the extra-fast Scooby-Doo tunnel (heck, the trip is even kind of fun), and Allegra, or, more accurately, the new skyscraper in which it lives, is the first thing you’ll spot as you exit Stratford International station. Don’t question why this station is called “international” when the line goes no farther than Kent; that’s another story. “But Stratford feels such a long way from Islington,” many have whined, as if I’d suggested they lambada the Camino to Santiago while wearing jelly shoes. Londoners will rarely trek right across the capital for dinner. Many will, however, fly to Lisbon for the weekend to eat bacalhau à brás. I am but a conduit of this madness. Allegra’s second frontier, in luring said diners, is that it’s sort of part of The Stratford, a hulking new, multi-floored lifestyle project containing a 145-bedroom hotel, a casual brasserie, a cocktail bar, rental apartments, sky gardens and so on, the sky being the limit and all that. This very much clutters the message that chef Patrick Powell, formerly of Chiltern Firehouse, Wild Honey and Dublin’s L’Ecrivain, is doing something quite separate and – I’ll lay my cards on the table now – really quite magical up on the seventh floor. He’s making smoked eel pithivier (if you’re too bone idle to look that up, it’s a fancy, boob-shaped pasty) and barbecued chicken wings with parmesan dumplings. And wild venison loin on roasted celeriac, and a sharing platter of heritage rib-eye with onion tarte tatin. Ignore the publicity photos, which suggest that Allegra is serving wearisome bowls of petals and shavings in clear broth, and which hammer home the information that Allegra’s designers had a hand in Noma, too. Everything about this new-ish restaurant’s messaging hints that it is sterile and Scandic, with a retro whiff of 80s yuppie. What is actually happening up on that seventh floor, however, is that a brilliant Irish chef is making elegant yet hearty, jolly and wholly delicious dinners. Yes, it is all quite taupe, beige and far from the West End, but the service is upbeat and flawless, and once there are a few dozen people sat along the pretty bar drinking cocktails, I prefer it very much to Chiltern Firehouse, which was always Dante’s hidden level of hell. Nobody went to Chiltern for the food; they went to feign interest in food while creep-shotting Jude Law eating crab doughnuts. Allegra’s food, on the other hand, is the whole point of the schlep. This is food that seeks to make you fat, and hooray for that. Artichoke velouté with shaved chestnuts arrives with a heavenly brioche. The soda bread, incidentally, is the most sumptuous in London, and comes with a green sauce, a sort of salsa verde by way of Killala, Co. Mayo. That venison loin, which Charles raved about, came with an extra mini-cottage pie made from the deer’s braised shoulder. One dish I’ve thought of many times since my visit was a side of pink fir apple potatoes with chives and sweet-and-sour onion. Yes, it was just a plain old plate of new potatoes and onion, but at the same time it was also an orgasmic hit of pickle vinegar, soft spud and creamy, crunchy caramelised onion ring. We ranged across the menu, eating one of those dinners where by the midway point we were already making plans about when to come back. Because what is the pain perdu with confit egg and wild mushrooms? And shouldn’t we try the turbot cooked in sake with congee? A main of perfectly judged monkfish with sweet crown prince pumpkin, shiitake and glazed pumpkin seeds was as pretty as it was adorable. I ate a slice of sticky, warm treacle cake for pudding with a highly likable caramelised pastry ice-cream. There was a confit apple millefeuille with salted caramel that my stomach pleaded with my eyes to order just to take home for bedtime snacking. Allegra and Tom Brown’s Cornerstone are two incredibly good reasons to discover less-travelled east London. If you can’t be bothered, it’s your loss, because there are literally millions of us over here, and we’ll just eat all the pain perdu ourselves. • Allegra The Stratford, 20 International Way, Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, London E20, 020- 3973 0545.

Three-course lunch £18; five-course dinner £35; wines from £20 This one must start at the end: with a treacle tart that tastes of all the good things, including attention to detail and a determined eagerness to please. The tart case is thin and crisp and dark; just the right amounts of brown sugar, butter and flour have been introduced to each other and have then decided to shack up together. It’s a virtuous platform for the filling. Unlike some treacle tarts, which you know will sit so heavily in your stomach they appear to have claimed squatter’s rights, this one is light and almost fluffy. There is a burst of citrus in there, pointed up by a separate bowl of lemon jelly. Next to that is a jug of warm, frothy cream, flavoured with Earl Grey tea. Both of those, however crowd-pleasing, are here only to stand in the service of the tart. As I fork it away, I mutter sagely to my companion that it is a treacle tart made by someone who has made an awful lot of them. I’m not wrong. That person is Mary-Ellen McTague. She made her name at the Aumbry in Prestwich before eventually opening the Creameries on a shopping parade here in the Manchester suburb of Chorlton in 2018. Originally, it was a retail bakery, which also served a few other things to nibble on. McTague stepped away for a while and only returned in September. Now there is a tight £18, three-course menu at lunchtime with a couple of choices at each stage, and a five-course menu in the evenings at £35. Both change regularly. “The lunch menu sometimes changes during service if we run out of something, or if something else comes in,” she tells me. I ask McTague when she first made that treacle tart. She tells me it would have been in 2004, when she was first with Heston Blumenthal at the Fat Duck, where she worked for many years. The Creameries looks so damn casual, as if there could be little to see here beyond a well-frothed cappuccino. The space is big on hard surfaces: polished concrete floors, gunmetal-grey painted walls, softened by foliage allowed to grow hither and yon from hanging baskets. There are sturdy wooden tables and benches that, in busy times, you will be required to share. Those menus are scratched up on blackboards, the better to change them at speed. It’s the reverse of one of those flash outfits that does the restaurant equivalent of kissing a bicep in the mirror, through over-engineered glassware and menus that are so embossed you can feel the letters under your fingertips. The Creameries will never bang on about taking you on a journey. McTague doesn’t want to take you anywhere except to your happy place. None of that, however, should obscure the vast amounts of technique involved here. Split peas are cooked down to a soft, savoury purée that is allowed to cool then cut into chips and deep fried. They arrive stacked as if for a game of Jenga you’ll never play, alongside a long, thick teardrop of a hugely savoury mushroom ketchup. There’s also a tiny bowl of what used to be called chipsticks: matchstick-thin crisps, seasoned with lime pickle that has been dehydrated and ground down to a powder. They are powerfully salty, but that doesn’t stop us finishing them, until the sides of our tongues are vibrating. They do, of course, still make bread here. It’s the best of sourdoughs. There is both a nutty scoop of brown butter and another of butter churned up with a sauerkraut liquor to become a big old dollop of boisterous tang. You may wonder about a person who stands staring at a lump of butter and thinks: “What this really needs is some of the liquor from that sauerkraut over there.” Instinctively, I like that person. There are only two choices at each course, so we have the entire menu. Two meaty pieces of their own lightly smoked mackerel have been seared and then served up with both a purée of pickled beetroot and a mustard cream. There are crunchy black pebbles of fried rye bread for texture. A thick cauliflower soup is swirled through with a Killeen cheese sauce. Bobbing in the middle is a cheese beignet. It’s cauliflower cheese in soup form. Across the top is sprinkled a little cumin salt. Meat makes only rare appearances. In this case it is a savoury deep pastry tart case filled with a glossy parsnip purée and then laid with pink pieces of partridge and pheasant to make what she calls a game pie. There is a heap of buttered kale on the side. Some people will look at pictures of this and complain about its compact size. They will make jokes about needing a burger on the way home that are so damn funny your sides will require suturing. As ever, I insist you take a look at me, take in the full 360 degrees of this adult male with shoulders so broad they’re in different time zones, and recognise that if I’m not complaining about portion size, you shouldn’t either. Eat three courses here and you will not go hungry. The other main is buttery, seared chunks of cabbice cabbage, on a big mess of more long-cooked split peas. Through it are tiny cubes of malt vinegar jelly made with a gelling agent that doesn’t melt in the heat, a clever Fat Duck trick if ever I saw one. These mushy peas are made to sing by the interlaced bursts of acidity. Around the plate are what the menu describes as “smoked pickled fried potatoes”. Someone has, obligingly, chucked salt and vinegar all over your chips. We finish with that joyous treacle tart and a fudgy, flourless chocolate cake, topped with cream, flavoured with the aniseed flourish of fennel. There’s almond brittle scattered here and there. Alternatively, we could have had a cheese plate. McTague likes her cheese. There is an intriguing list of wines to go with it. I have things to do later so I don’t drink, which means two of us are presented with a ludicrous bill for a three-course lunch of just £46, service optional. They have a zero-waste policy. They wear their commitments to sustainability like badges of authenticity. But then we are in Chorlton, where these things are taken seriously. Bravo, and so on. What you really need to know, however, is this: you get all that, as well as seriously good, thoughtful food from someone who knows exactly what they’re doing. News bites Elsewhere in Manchester Bistrotheque at Cultureplex, an offspring of the London restaurant of the same name, is proving to be a thoroughly reliable late-night dinner option. The dining area is an offshoot of the huge, handsome, wood and red brick warehouse conversion. A recent meal there started with very good duck rillettes followed by cod with chilli, garlic and sage and a Swaledale rump steak with café de Paris butter (bistrotheque.com/cultureplex). A book to add to the want list for 2020: Vegan Japaneasy from former MasterChef winner and Japanese food expert Tim Anderson. It’s a sequel to Japaneasy, which demystified the country’s repertoire, and taps into its rich history of plant-based cookery. The volume is published by Hardie Grant Books on 5 March, price £22. In the runup to Christmas, the Café Rouge group has launched an afternoon tea themed around Raymond Briggs’ classic book The Snowman. The menu, available until January 5, includes croque monsieur with pigs in blankets, scones dusted with icing sugar ‘snow’, and a white chocolate mousse topped with a ‘snowball’. It costs £29.95 for two. How they deal with the existential angst of the titular snowman dying at the end of the story – he melts away to nothing - is not clear (caferouge.com).

Dependable dinner, dependably raucous crowd. Chic chaos, steak frites, Twinkles, then downstairs to the club area to watch vagabond drag cabaret act The LipSinkers belt through songs by ABC, Kate Bush and Madonna. Or at least that’s how I remember Bistrotheque in its early days, down a back lane where mini-cabs drove gingerly. Nothing wholesome ever happened there; it was, instead, a space where renegades thrived. Now, almost 16 years later, I find myself off to an all-new Bistrotheque in Manchester, in a former railway goods warehouse behind Piccadilly station. This new Bistrotheque is a small subsection of a vast, land-of-dreams leisure complex named Cultureplex. Created by Pablo Flack and David Waddington, the very same people who conjured up both Bistrotheque and then Hoi Polloi at the Ace hotel in Shoreditch, Cultureplex is one of those dining, eating, drinking, thinking, art-house, cocktail, coffee spaces that have emerged this year, in a similar vein to Oxford Street’s extravagant yet puzzling Arcade Food Theatre. Ah, these hyper-modern spaces that defy neat definition, or even any incredibly baggy definition. The more you gaze at Cultureplex’s website, the less fettered by earthly possibility you become. Go for a double cortado at Klatch, stay for the Bob Fosse movie, hear a piano recital by Rowan Lewis, then take an animal movement class at the gym, Blok. This is what today’s modern renegades desire. Hidden in a corner of this cultural playground is Bistrotheque, serving the likes of sea trout with miso and confit tomatoes or pork chop with braised fennel. Similar in vibe, up to a certain point, to its London sibling, with pristine, white tablecloths, smart-casual serving staff and a cocktail list of new innovations that makes you want to clear the afternoon and kick off your shoes. I settled for just the one Joan Collins (gin, cherry liqueur, apple, lemon and soda) and a glass of cleansing mineral water, having seen myself on HDTV the previous day with a chablis-infused face the circumference of Charlie Brown’s. Actually, I also had a rather good bloody mary beforehand, while sitting in a weird no man’s land area beside a vast bar area that at 1pm was neither actually open nor completely shut. The dilemma with enormous, “everything is possible” dining spaces is that, in reality, nothing is done properly. You’re just milling about in a glorified aircraft hangar, asking, “Is this open?” “Can I sit here?” “Who do I pay?” We had eventually perched on one of the sofas that none of the various coffee, lounge, bar, dining set-ups appeared responsible for, meaning that our dirty glasses, without coasters, stayed on the stained coffee table for more than an hour. But never mind, because no one charged us for them, anyway. Service within Bistrotheque itself, however, is friendly and diligent; I’m just not certain the food is very good. A starter of a generous lump of cured salmon with beetroot tartare and horseradish came scattered with sea salt and capers. The fish sat in a puddle of green and burgundy jus. The plate looked like a Van Gogh. It was too cold, tasted sharp and was not wildly delicious. A potato and comté pithivier – that’s a pie by another name – was far too heavy-handed with the comté, much of which hadn’t been given a chance to melt. The flavours of the pastry and the spud were given even less room to breathe by a thick, green mustard sauce and a fistful of crisp, fried sage. Desperate Dan could not have finished this pie. A chunky steak tartare with a neatly placed, wobbly yolk looked pretty, but was jam-packed with capers that quashed any subtlety of flavour in the meat. Sea trout was rather overcooked and came in a pool of largely forgettable, miso-laced, tomato sauce. Soft, delicate plum frangipane tart with creme fraiche, however, was glorious. Nobody went to Bistrotheque in London entirely for the food. Or, in fact, ever. They went for the scene. They went, if they were honest, to see and be seen. The fact that they served you posh fish and chips while you sat within elbow distance of a fashion designer, a supermodel and a performance artist was merely a bonus. Cultureplex is a gargantuan space, designated purely for art, music and a semi-orderly level of anarchy, interspersed with gym sessions and wine tastings. It is currently an “everything space” in search of some actual meaning. It’s up to Manchester to deliver. • Bistrotheque at Cultureplex, Ducie Street, Manchester M1, 0161-713 3130.

Starters £3.20-£12.80, roast duck portion £11.40, half £14.40, mains £9.30-£20.50, wines from £17.80, beers £4.50 It’s after dinner that we really notice it. London’s Gerrard Street on a Saturday night is usually the restaurant equivalent of a mosh pit: a heaving crowd of hungry people, the scent of scorched wok in their nostrils, and the reflection of the bronzed and shiny roast ducks that crowd the windows of Chinatown’s main drag in their eyeballs. Tonight, there was a pre-cinema rush, which we got caught up in. But now it’s gone 9pm. The pedestrianised street is sparsely populated and through the picture windows, chairs and tables sit forlorn and empty. I’ve never seen it like this before. After the Chinese New Year at the end of January, as news of the emerging coronavirus spread, “business just went down,” says Jackie, duty manager of the Four Seasons at No 12, her hand making a swooping gesture like a plane crashing to ground. “We want the business back but we can’t do anything about it,” she says, with a sad shrug. “People are scared.” Because a nasty virus has broken out in a city 5,500 miles away from London, Britain’s Chinese community is suffering. Because, y’know, Chinese people. There are reports of abuse on the streets, of Asians being shunned on public transport. Across the Chinese restaurant sector, business is down. The mother of one Anglo-Chinese friend calls it “health-linked racial discrimination”. It doesn’t matter what excuse you choose for your racism. It’s still racism. So this is a review with a simple message: go and support your local Chinese restaurant. Go show them that ethnicity is not a marker for disease. I didn’t need to go to the branch of the Four Seasons at 12 Gerrard Street to write about it. I eat there alone about once a month, taking a yellow-clothed table in the corner of one of the plain dining rooms. It’s often before going to record an episode of the Kitchen Cabinet for Radio 4, when having a good lunch is a grand idea: a plate of Cantonese roast meats of one sort or another, something green, a magazine to read. The food speaks directly to an intense, needy part of my appetite. I also like the brisk and efficient staff who greet me like a total stranger every time, despite the fact I’ve been going for years. I’ve mentioned it on this page and elsewhere before. So no, I really didn’t need to go again. I know what they do and how well they do it. But this is an act of solidarity that also gets me roast duck. I was introduced to this Four Seasons by chef and writer Simon Hopkinson. He once told me the Chinese are the best at roasting ducks and that this is one of the best places for the best. I say this one, because it’s a group, which started over on London’s Queensway. There are now half a dozen, including one in Leicester and one literally next door, which specialises in hot pots. But I have my loyalties. Sometimes I have the cubed belly pork. It has crackled skin like glass that shatters beneath the teeth, giving way to the soft layer of ivory-coloured fat underneath and then, below that, the meat. Tonight, though, we start with the char siu. It is not a worrying shade of traffic light red, as it sometimes can be, and nor is it dry, or too thinly sliced. It’s just a deep, reddy brown, and in pleasing thumb-thick pieces and is eye-rollingly savoury. It comes on a heap of Chinese cabbage with the obligatory moat of dark, sweet-savoury liquor, which could be sipped neat as a restorative. Sometimes, when I am by myself and I’m convinced nobody is looking, I do just that, lifting the bowl to my lips as if it were a teacup. My motto: “No spoonful left behind.” And then the roast duck – the skin dark lacquered, most of the fat rendered, the meat soft and sensuous to the tongue as if braised. Crispy duck with pancakes is the boisterous crowd-pleaser, and has its place. Deep orange Peking duck, with its caramel-crunchy skin slicing rituals and its two services, is the fancy Bond Street version. Peking duck can be exhausting, like some high maintenance pretty friend who constantly needs to be told how beautiful they are. This roast duck is the one I prefer: it doesn’t need to be wrapped up in pancakes. It doesn’t need hoisin or plum sauce or vegetables shredded within an inch of their life. It’s self-contained and self-assured. Usually I get it bone in, because I like its tactile nature. Tonight, though, for ease of management with a sizable group, we have it boneless. Most of my party hasn’t tried it this way before. I get to nod at them in a self-satisfied manner and mouth the words “I know” as they coo and mutter. Next the greens. For a long while it was the dry-fried green beans with minced pork and chilli. Then I discovered they did something similar with a big old tangle of morning glory. It comes in a thick pot, much like a classic mortar, which is so searingly hot they have to serve it inside a second container to spare the table. This means that when you’re done with the vegetables, a ballast of minced pork and chilli has continued cooking and crusted around the bottom. It is illegal to not scrape this up. Beware: the metal spoon gets finger-burning hot from the bowl. We have big curls of salt and pepper squid in a fine, lacy batter and, because I’m feeling adventurous, lamb with ginger in a dark, sticky Peking sauce. We drink jasmine tea and a few Tsing Tao beers and run up a bill of £130 for four. There are wines, which I know from experience to be less than fabulous, but then why would you? We do not even investigate dessert. Just outside the door are waffle shops and Chinese patisseries. Until about 15 years ago, London’s Chinatown was a sad place. You didn’t go there to eat well. But the opening up of China has brought us the country’s thrilling variety from Sichuan to Shanghai, from Hunan to Xinjiang and back again. It’s happening all over. Walking from Birmingham New Street station recently, I was staggered to see that the once mainly Cantonese Chinatown has grown from a tiny cluster to a vast district apparently representing all the provinces. Britain’s Chinese restaurant offering is more diverse and exciting than it’s ever been. Please go and eat in one. Now. News bites Time to name check a few other Chinese favourites. In Blackpool there’s the Wok Inn Seaside Noodle Bar, both for pan-Asian dishes and Cantonese classics (and it’s mothership deeper into town, Mandarin). In Manchester go to Live Seafood, for crustacea from the tanks cooked all ways. In Edinburgh visit Chop Chop for seriously compelling dumplings. And elsewhere in London’s Chinatown, try Baiwei for bare bones Sichuan or JinLi just around the corner for similar food in plusher surroundings. Dumpling’s Legend is the place for Xiao Long Bao (or soupy dumplings), and just across Shaftesbury Avenue there’s the ever-brilliant Y Ming. Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it’s a ‘premium immersive restaurant experience’ based on the characters from the DC Comics universe, including Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman et al. What this means in terms of the actual food is anybody’s guess, but it will occupy an 18,000 square foot basement site on London’s Brewer Street. Jamie Oliver continues to rebuild his restaurant interests, despite the closure of so many UK outlets last year when the Jamie’s Italian group failed, resulting in mass redundancies. Chequer Lane will open in Dublin in April and will promote ‘the best of Irish produce’.

Four course à la carte: £98, wines from £38 Complaining about the prices being too high at Claridge’s is like moaning about the Pope being too religious or Rory Stewart being too annoying. It literally comes with the territory, that territory being a corner in London’s Mayfair. So let’s acknowledge that four courses at Davies and Brook, named after the two streets upon which it sits, costs £98 and move on. It’s what happens when one of London’s grandest hotels imports one of New York’s most garlanded chefs. You are, however, entitled to raise an eyebrow when, having booked two months in advance, you are shown to the worst table in the room, a thin tableclothed strip against a narrow sofa upon which you and your companion must sit, side by side. There, dinner still costs £98. Perhaps restaurants should introduce theatre-style pricing: the lousier your seat the less you pay. To be fair, the receptionist did look anxious when she clocked the table and offered to put us in the bar until something better became available. I declined. Although I book under a pseudonym, I’m obviously not anonymous once I arrive. But I can pretend to be anonymous, by just taking what I’m given. What will Davies and Brook feel like from up here on the mezzanine looking down on the beautiful people? At one point my companion tries to pull more of the tiny table her way. “It’s like you’re trying to steal the duvet,” I say. Our waiter laughs and says, “I like your sense of humour,” in a serious way, like Rutger Hauer in Blade Runner, just after the whole speech about having witnessed attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. Davies and Brook forces such epic comparisons. It belongs to Daniel Humm, chef of the three Michelin star Eleven Madison Park in New York. I ate there more than a decade ago, when it was an urban bistro serving robust, punchy food. They were famed for bringing a whole roast duck to your table prior to carving, lavender poking out of its arse. But over the years Humm has refined his cooking. Now it catches the eye of those who hand out the stars and of grand hotels looking for a USP. Until 2018 this dining room was home to Fera, the London outpost of chef Simon Rogan of L’Enclume where the cooking is an expression of the Cumbrian landscape. The experience, while accomplished, felt disjointed here in Mayfair, where crags are in short supply. Before that, from 2001, it was Gordon Ramsay’s first hotel dining room, a place of high-gloss classicism. I reviewed both, so here I am for the third take. The room has been pared down to cool downlit greys, with artfully arranged vases of calla lilies. The ceiling is decorated with long overlaid oval recesses that a lazier critic might compare to female genitalia and in turn use as an excuse for jokes about being screwed, but I’m better than that. It is all extremely poised, as is the cooking, which has a pronounced Asian accent. The first taster dish, presented in an antique wooden box to emphasise the profound value of the moment, is a saucer of congee, a savoury rice porridge, in a mushroom and ginger broth, overlaid with enoki mushrooms. Mushrooms play a big part in all this. Fabulous, golden-glazed brioche-like bread rolls come with mushroom glazed butter. There’s a second taster of an enoki mushroom salad, laid out in a fan. Among the warm starters, at a £10 supplement, is a king crab chawanmushi, a warm Japanese-style savoury custard over which has been laid strips of crab, black truffle and daikon radish, in a mildly glutinous sauce. Like the congee, it’s clever, if texturally challenging. Everything is coffee-table photography book pretty. A lightly acidulated ceviche of bass arrives as a disc under rippling pieces of avocado. On the side is a deep green cucumber sauce that tastes of crustless summer sandwiches. A carrot salad, with the crunch of seeds and a quail egg yolk, as if to lubricate a steak tartare, is the best carrots can hope for. It reminds me fondly of the carotte râpée at Brasserie Zedel (price £3.75). A pearly square of turbot in a thyme-perfumed, slightly viscous broth, lies under petals of black truffle and leek. These dishes are the artworks you admire very much in a gallery, but know you could never live with at home. Then, praise be, the clouds part and the sunlight rushes in. The main courses are simply two of the best plates of food I have been served in London in many years. My cynicism about this kind of high-altitude culinary exhibitionism drains away. Pert, perfectly cooked pieces of black cod are brushed with the lightest touch of miso and grilled. It’s what Nobu’s black cod would be if it learned some manners. There is a sweet savoury broth, and a crisp leaf of dried cabbage, with the intensity of toasted nori. The other plate holds the evolution of that duck dish I was served so long ago. The birds are dry-aged until the meat has an uncommon depth of flavour and tension. The fat is rendered. The spice-dotted skin is crisp. To one side are curls of daikon hiding a pink rhubarb compote. Bringing it all together is a sweet-sour, blood-thickened jus that softens against the duck. Oh my. Are gastro-palaces like this worth the expense? For cooking of this quality, yes, they are. The standard stays up with a pitch-perfect cloud-like chocolate tart with coconut ice-cream; slightly less so with an apple doughnut. The latter is exceptionally well made. It’s a sugared doughnut. What’s not to like? But I have to stifle a laugh. The apple filling, which doubtless took endless work, is an absolute ringer for a McDonald’s apple pie. The same happens with the dark chocolate leaf filled with a peppermint cream that accompanies our mint tea. Again, a skilled chocolatier must have worked for hours on this. Only to produce an over-engineered After Eight. No matter: here is a sealed bag of chocolate and coconut granola with which to remember them in the morning. Which is nice. I pay the heroic bill, made more so by a wine list offering nothing below £38, and wander out into the night. I have eaten some show-stopping duck and cod. I have done Davies and Brook. But taken in the round, I doubt it’s something I will ever quite feel the need to do again. News bites French-born pastry chef Dominique Ansel made his name in New York with the cronut before, like Humm, opening in London. Alongside his bakery he’s now opened Dominique Ansel Treehouse in Covent Garden. As well as savoury dishes, the interest and the Instagram posts are focusing on desserts for two or three to share. They include a sizable bowl of chocolate mousse for £12 with your own toppings, and a sticky toffee pudding shaped like a bundt cake with a double toffee and custard sauce (dominiqueanseltreehouse.com). The northwest-based sight-loss charity Henshaws is holding its second Dinner In The Dark fundraiser in Manchester’s Albert Square Chop House on 1 May. During the dinner, hosted by paralympian Lora Fachie, diners will be blindfolded. Tickets cost £75 (henshaws.org.uk). In other news, London fish-and-chip group Kerbisher and Malt has put its remaining standalone restaurant on the market, but continues to operate in Market Halls, Victoria. L’Enclume chef Simon Rogan is to take the restaurant to Sydney, Australia, for a six-week residency this summer. And chef Michael Caines has closed his Devon restaurant, the Coach House, because of a “major infrastructural fault” within the Kentisbury Grange Hotel, which houses it.

Snacks £3.50, starters £7-£9, mains £13-£26, desserts £7, wines from £19.50 Farmyard in Norwich is the kind of restaurant that brings out the maternal in me. Reading the menu makes me feel like one of those parents standing in the wings during the auditions for Britain’s Got Talent, watching my kids, Ant and Dec’s hands lightly on my shoulders for moral support. I am desperate for the kitchen to succeed. I want to hug them all to my bosom and tell them everything will be OK. I’m also terrified they’ll drop the catch. This is a grossly patronising thing to say to a crew of experienced chefs. But the menu is so ambitiously all over the place, is such a random, swooping collection of dishes, I can’t quite help myself. It’s not so much restless as on the run. Say hello to cooking which draws its inspiration from Mexico or Japan, north Africa or Spain, and a bunch of places in-between. It demands so many skills, so much understanding of how various techniques, spices and dishes sit within a culture, that misfires seem almost guaranteed. Some of it is simply down to the language used. On the menu they describe what they do as “Bistronomy”, a venerable word first coined in Paris in the early 90s by skilled chefs tired of the puckered and stiff atmosphere in the city’s grandest garlanded gastro palaces. They wanted to continue being creative, adventurous cooks, but within the frame of a relaxed bistro, with the encouraging pricing that implies. This bright and comfortable space with its industrial ducted ceiling, strand board flooring, and partially open white tiled kitchen, certainly cannot be accused of pretension. For the proctologically challenged, be aware: there are padded banquettes. The menu language is a little more trying. A wonton as served here is surely just a dumpling or folded piece of pasta by another misused name? A beetroot “wine gum” is simply a piece of partially dehydrated beetroot. You can decide to be profoundly irritated by this mangling of the lexicon, or you can judge the food on the plate. I’m going with the latter because, for the most part, it works. There are misfires. The batter of salt and pepper squid, from the part of the menu headed “snacks”, doesn’t seem especially interested in staying attached to its host. But it only costs £3.50 so it’s hard to roll your eyes for long. Those beetroot “wine gums”, sweet and chewy, are served with a dollop of horseradish cream to pull them through. They leave strawberry-coloured ribbons through the Dulux whiteness, and are much better. Some dish names are a gentle joke built around understatement. Ham, egg and chips are lumps of smoky, salty, collapsing ham hock, with a cured egg yolk and a big knot of deep-fried, spiralised potato. The latter seems at first a little hard and under cooked, but there is a limpid hammy broth at the bottom of the bowl. The “chips” keep much of their bite as they shatter into it with a whack of the fork. “Spicy carrot wonton” are, as I suggested, just another word for folded-over ravioli, and not especially spicy. But there is a thick celeriac purée here, and a few roasted carrots to maintain the interest. It may not quite match up to its billing, but it’s a solid and reliable bit of cooking. As is a £16 main course of a roasted chicken leg, with a boneless, breaded and deep-fried wing, on a thick truffle purée and chicken jus. Half a roasted leek, singed in various places, slumps across it, languorously. It’s a roast chicken dinner that has polished its shoes and combed its hair. To go alongside we have a bowl of shredded brassicas, through which both toasted almonds and a pokey salsa verde have been spooned. It’s a cheery act of attention to detail. A potato “terrine” is another version of spuds sliced and pressed and cooked, then cut into rectangles and deep fried, which, at Bubala a few months back, were described erroneously as latkes. Whatever the name, they are always welcome. A vegetable ramen is a dish I find myself nodding at admiringly, rather than adoring. There is a powerful depth to the broth, and the handfuls of toasted barley buried in its steaming depths alongside a load of other veg, make sure nobody will go hungry. But the noodles are replaced by spiralised carrot. It’s an odd call. This is partly because the use of noodles would not have impacted the meat-free nature of the dish. They would have added a little extra starch to the broth and would also have justified calling it a ramen. But mostly it’s an odd call because it makes it seem as if owning a spiralizer is an entirely reasonable life choice, when of course they are implements that deserve to be pointed and laughed at with such malice that they eventually throw themselves into the bin out of embarrassment. Even allowing for the unevenness of that dish I could imagine myself back here trying their version of a multi-layered mole poblano with BBQ lamb and blue corn tacos, just to see whether they could actually pull it off, or the roast hake with paprika chickpea stew. This Farmyard is determined to fatten up its residents. Desserts flip between the outrageous and the outrageously comforting. The former is described as a “white chocolate bar”. It’s a sizable block of soft, sticky white chocolate ganache. It would be tooth-achingly sweet were it not for the bold saltiness of the miso caramel slathered across the top, the scattering of peanuts and the intense dark chocolate sorbet. It’s a re-engineered Snickers Bar, perhaps by someone who recently kicked a major crystal meth habit and is now looking for a socially acceptable way by which to get off their face. By comparison a steamed ginger pudding, perched on rings of lightly spiced pineapple with a coconut sorbet is a gentle all-in-one hug and back rub. Here at Farmyard they may not always achieve every one of their ambitions. Some of those catches really are dropped. But walking back along the Norwich lane it calls home, passed unremarkable pizzerias and reliable looking bistros and cocktail bars designed for a Friday night, the niche it fills became obvious. It is for restaurant goers who are happy to give the kitchen permission to try just a little harder and attempt just a little more. And really, couldn’t we all do with a restaurant like that? News bites Right now you may not be considering visiting restaurants, but you will do so again. In the spirit of support for the restaurant sector, this column will continue making recommendations. Just over on the Norfolk coast from Farmyard is No 1 Cromer, which belongs to chef Galton Blackiston of Morston Hall. Downstairs it’s a fine chippie and ice cream bar. Upstairs, there’s a globe-trotting bistro which takes in everything from fish tacos to hoisin duck pancakes, tandoori chicken naan and a massaman vegan curry. It’s ambitious but, generally it works (no1cromer.com). Until the end of April Heston Blumenthal’s three Michelin star Fat Duck in Bray is reducing the price of its menu by £75. It’s still a stonking £250 with the discount. At time of writing there are some lunchtime tables available in the sparsely spaced dining room. This may be the moment to try it (thefatduck.co.uk). Oisin Rogers, who is the closest thing London has to a celebrity publican, is to take a second boozer under his wing, alongside the Guinea Grill in Mayfair, famed for its beefy menu of steaks and claret. He’s revamping the nearby Windmill, and bringing in dishes including beef cheek and oyster pie, and quality fish and chips.

Snacks and starters £2.50-£7.50, mains £5-£9.50, unlicensed Restaurant reviews can serve different purposes. Some are there so the writer can tell you what they did at the weekend and invite you to consider their lovely life. Many are service journalism: here’s a place that may be worth your money, and do try the hispi cabbage. Others can be social anthropology through the medium of lunch. The late Jonathan Gold, who reviewed for the LA Times prior to his infuriatingly premature death in 2018, aged 57, did the latter. From feverishly following Gold, the only food critic ever to win a Pulitzer Prize, I learned that in Los Angeles, the serious food action was rarely to be found in the rhinestoned and anally bleached neighbourhoods of Beverly Hills or Bel Air. It was within the mosaic of communities from different ethnic groups that made up the rest of the urban sprawl. He made a modest southern Thai restaurant called Jitlada, on a less-than-lovely stretch of Sunset Boulevard in East Hollywood, famous for the way it layered flavours and made your scalp sweat, owing to chilli heat. I ate there alone one night and gave thanks there was no one to witness me swabbing my brow as I returned repeatedly to curries with an almost psychotropic effect. By email, Gold explained to me once that in Los Angeles I was likely to find more traditional Korean restaurants than in Seoul. In the South Korean capital, he said, they will be looking to the future. “In LA, the Korean immigrants are remembering where they came from.” In Britain, much of the anthropological reviewing of this sort comes from some of the bigger restaurant websites, and very handy those lists are. The writers can, however, tend to come across like those Victorian explorers who trumpet their discovery of a previously unknown and isolated tribe, when the tribe didn’t need to be discovered because they knew exactly where they were all the time and were getting along just fine without the interruption, thank you very much. Writing about a category of restaurants is not the same as inventing that category of restaurants. There is also the risk that, in a city overburdened by the hyper-designed and over-priced, the quality of the food served in a modest restaurant becomes venerated simply because of all the things the business is not. Rule of thumb: review anything – music, books, restaurants – because of what it is, not because of what it isn’t. Your Mum’s Kitchen, located down a side road near London’s Finchley Road tube, is a bare-bones café and utterly delightful for being that. Based on the steady parade of people entering the brightly lit basement dining room from the Korean corner shop above, it’s clearly already been found in the eight months since the Son family took over SK Mart and launched the restaurant. And now I’ve found it courtesy of a tip-off from singer-songwriter Tom Rosenthal, who lives nearby. It’s open from noon until 8.30pm and seats only a couple of dozen on both cushion-strewn benches against the wall and chairs with proper back support. Fetch your own water and glasses from the table in the corner. Take in the wooden poles in primary Ikea shades of yellow and blue. There are many teas including ginger, plum or yuzu sweetened with honey, but it is unlicensed. (You can bring your own for a modest corkage fee.) There’s a concise menu of snacks and stews, or stir fries with rice. Nothing costs more than £9.50 and you can see exactly where it’s all coming from because, in one corner, fitted for the most part with domestic appliances, is the kitchen with someone else’s mum in it. Her name is Mi Ja Hong, and she is the waiter’s mum. We order a seafood pajeon and watch as she whips up the batter for the thick pancake. It arrives golden brown and sliced into squares, the green of spring onion tracing lines across the lacy surface, as they weave in and out of the curls of squid. The edges where it has crisped against the hot pan are the prized bits I head for. On the side is a deep soy dipping sauce. Pan-fried chicken dumplings are serviceable, but the chicken wings are so much more than that: double fried to form a shatteringly crisp shell, then drenched in a sweet and fiery gochujang-based glaze, with the apparent aromatics of cinnamon. It’s a big, meaty plateful for £6. A bowl of their fiery kimchi takes the edge off the overt sweetness. The main courses are big hearty stews of a sort you want on a winter’s day. Non-meat eaters beware, or perhaps ask for advice. Some vegetarian-sounding dishes come larded (almost literally) with pieces of belly pork. I’m not complaining, but you might. A kimchi stew is a bowl of rust-coloured liquor with a hot and sour intensity and, in the bottom, blocks of silky tofu to cool everything down. Pieces of squid in a stir fry, which some might find just a little too soft and unapologetically squid-like, are doused in a sweet sauce that is a close cousin of that used on the chicken wings. We also have tubular rice cakes like packing foam in a black bean sauce that is the unrelenting black of Johnny’s black paintings in The Fast Show, so you get to stare into the morbid abyss while you eat. It’s quite the salty plateful, which makes its mark based on just a couple of spoonfuls. The star turn, though, is the special of yukgaejang advertised via a paper notice taped to the wall. It’s a spicy beef soup with solid pieces of meat and cabbage in its endlessly sustaining depths. Like the kimchi stew, it is the shade of rust that might kill a few white shirts for ever. But you wouldn’t regret losing a bit of prime laundry to a broth like this. Afterwards you head upstairs and pay the £15-a-head bill at the counter, and purchase all the Korean sauces you couldn’t resist on your journey past the shelves. If you want cake get it from the café next door. Almost all the other customers who came in to eat were Asian, which suggests this is a business serving a local community in search of the home cooking of a home now a long way away. Clearly, it’s doing that job very well. There are obviously bigger Korean restaurants in London offering longer, more sophisticated menus. But I doubt there are many that are as sweet and beguiling as this one. News bites Seoul Kimchi, by Manchester’s Royal Infirmary, could be twinned with Your Mum’s Kitchen. It started as a shop selling ingredients from home to Korean students in the city, then added a few tables before reversing the business and becoming a small, achingly cheap restaurant selling a few ingredients. Go there for Korean fried chicken, stir fries, rice bowls and, for the geographically restless, a bit of sushi (facebook.com/seoulkimchimanchester). Chef Tom Norrington-Davies, formerly of the much-loved, much-missed Great Queen Street, is putting his other skill as a yoga instructor to work in service of the Pilot Light, the campaigning organisation providing support on mental health issues to people in the hospitality industry. On 24 March he’ll be holding a yoga workshop for chefs, and anyone else who is on their feet all day, to raise funds for them at TriYoga in London’s Shoreditch. Tickets costs £5 (triyoga.co.uk). The 350-strong Restaurant Group, which owns brands like Frankie and Benny’s and Chiquito, is looking to close up to 90 of those outlets by the end of 2021.

Decimo, as in Spanish for 10th, is the floor that it lives on. The capital was, to my mind at least, not pining for any more fancy restaurants at the top of tall buildings, yet still they come. I could write a hospitality MA thesis on how cooking standards plummet the more floors one ascends to the pretty view. No sane person has ever thought that duck with waffle sounded like a delicious idea, but add the chance of vertigo to the recipe, and there’s a lemming stampede towards the lifts. That said, I was curious about Decimo. The rest of The Standard, including two other restaurants, Isla and Double Standard, opened in the summer, but this vast mezcal and aguachile palace took its time to reveal itself. Meanwhile, the hotel itself quickly became my go-to recommendation for travellers in search of fun. It is, in parts, a David Lynch-style dreamscape of fractal carpets and flickering hearth fires, and in others a party palace on a Quentin Tarantino set. The yearningly gorgeous suites have minibars with full bottles of Patrón silver tequila and baths out on the balconies in the open air, so you can be stark naked and clutching a loofah, yet just out of view of the commuters at St Pancras. This whole swinging scene lives in a meticulous restoration of the 1974 brutalist architectural chunk that was once Camden town hall. I cannot vouch for drunken nudity occurring during its use by London council workers. Nor did any reissue of a parking permit ever involve kalibos red cabbage with blue cheese or quail with a mole glaze. Decimo, for all my chunterings about food with a view, turned out to be more than worth the wait, and it, too, is somewhere I would now point people to. It feels like the beginning of a whole new era in London restaurants, and it is entirely Los Angeles in mood. Vast, slick, multi-levelled, painstakingly designed, laden with cacti and succulents. A dragoon of hostesses, all six foot tall and clad in fitted, floor-length hessian smocks tailored to their tiny ribcages, chivvy you every metre of the way from the elevator to your table. London is used to expensive, multi-million-pound hotel restaurants that mean well and talk a good game, but that are actually chilly, sterile spaces. Decimo is the opposite. It is beautiful, decorated in shades of burgundy, ombré and green. But what is the food like, I hear you scream? Well, it is slighty ridiculous, sometimes delicious, sometimes “meh”, but at least it aims to challenge. Does anyone actually want cabbage and blue cheese? And I’m not entirely sure tortilla (fancy runny omelette) even complements caviar (fancy runny fish goo) yet, like zombies, diners order it (at £40 for the small one). Food comes on wooden boards, on top of brown parchment paper, or on pale, marble slabs. Dinner resembles an autopsy by a highly precise pathologist. The quail, in its peculiar, not entirely lovable mole glaze, looks like a mafia warning. Four pieces of strategically sculpted carrot steeped in orange cost £6. Carbs do not play a huge part on Decimo’s menu, or in the lifestyle choice of anyone who works there. One of the greatest things I ate there, or indeed have eaten all this year, was a fairly innocuous-sounding concoction called “marinated red peppers”, which turned out to be an odd, circular serving of rich, smoky-sweet, remarkable-tasting pepper served on marble with nothing. “Would you like bread?” asked one of the celestial visions. What else would we do with it? Scrape the marble with a knife directly into our mouths? I called Charles before writing this, and he asked if we’d even eaten here. I said, “Yes, we sat at the table and ate bowls of amazing smoked almonds. And an absolutely gorgeous piece of turbot. The staff were lovely and they talked to you about mezcal.” “I don’t remember eating,” he said. “You had quail, which arrived cut in half on a marble slab. We had gambas rojo, which were delicious, but, like, £18 for four. And a plate of cecina. And chocolate tart, which was sort of so-so. The staff all seemed to be models.” “I remember the staff,” he said. “Definitely.” Decimo – gorgeous, sexy and glamorous as hell – is sweeping the restaurant world into a new decade. Whether Charles is getting to go there with me is an entirely different column. • Decimo The Standard, 10 Argyle Street, London WC1, 020-3981 8888.

All savoury dishes £5.90-£9.50, desserts £7, wines from £26 There is a strain within postwar modern sculpture that, like the male ego, is dependent for its impact on enlargement. The small and banal is rendered otherworldly and apparently interesting simply by dint of having been expanded to something far beyond the expected. Think Jeff Koons’s shiny, polished balloon animals, inflated to elephantine size, or the 70m-long pink knitted rabbit, seemingly dropped on to a hillside by the Austrian art collective Gelitin, as if the discarded toy of some unimaginably giant child. Don’t worry. This is still the restaurant column. Art criticism remains the sacred domain of my marvellous colleague Laura Cumming. But dinner at Merienda, in Stockbridge, to the north of Edinburgh’s city centre, did make me brood on those vast, one-trick sculptures. Because, whether consciously or not – let’s go with not – it feels like the kitchen here is attempting a reverse manoeuvre: rendering the ordinary much more interesting, simply by making it very small indeed. As each tiny plateful arrives, I am forced to push my reading glasses up the bridge of my nose and peer down, as if examining a rare jewel. Is this an intense and thrilling examination of the impact of sustained heat on the natural sugars deep within orange squash? Or is it, you know, just a really, really small portion of roasted veg? It’s a risky strategy. Early on I run my finger down the list of dishes, all at around £7 or £8, and thinking myself a veteran of this sharing plate thing, this clattering parade of “never enough” and “more please”, I conclude the three of us will need three dishes each. Our waiter takes a sharp intake of breath. “Well,” she says, solemnly, “they are tasting-menu size.” Oh joy. We will therefore need more. Quite a few more. Which means it’s not quite as good value as at first it seemed. It also means the kitchen has set itself a trap. If it’s about small and often, then they can’t get away with a compact menu of greatest hits. There are more than 20 dishes on offer tonight. The fact is few kitchens, operating outside of a set repertoire – I’m excluding those working in, say, Chinese traditions – can pull off a long menu. It’s always going to be a case of big hitters, solid fillers and “What the hell were they thinking?” So it proves. In October, Merienda joined the ranks of those like the Leaping Hare, which I reviewed a few weeks ago, which have received a Bib Gourmand from Michelin. A reminder: it’s meant to signify good food at a reasonable price, currently £30 for three courses or the equivalent. I can see that at Merienda you can, if you choose well, get exactly that. You could also get something decidedly less so. But in the words of the song, let’s accentuate the positive. There is a crisp friable disc of filo pastry, piled with lubricated white crabmeat, topped in turn with a full Ker-Plunk of green apple batons, in a puddle of brisk acidic dressing. Of course, being tiny, it’s gone quickly. We miss it because it is sweet and salty and crisp and crunchy. Finely dicing up pear and walnut does not make them into a tartare. That’s a word applied to something served raw when normally it would be cooked. But slathering them in a Roquefort dressing does make it punchy and amusing. We adore a sizable chunk of duck breast, served pink, with a pile of fresh fava beans and loads of crisped chorizo, all bound together by a glossy jus. The roast squash with a few croutons is a nice enough side dish. At the end there is a well-roasted pear with splodges of salt caramel, and a few kernels of caramel popcorn as if someone had left a bag of Butterkist open, and it was felt better to use it. Other things just missed the point, baffled us or weren’t very nice. “Bean purée with parsley pesto and powdered porcini mushroom”, sounds both rugged and flashily modern at the same time. But nice words are not the same as nice things to eat. It is just a bit gritty and salty. So too, the “nage poached Hebridean salmon, potato, dill, carrot cream” in which the fish has been so overpoached and so grossly underseasoned that you couldn’t help wishing the poor animal had been left to live out its days back in the Hebrides. It is the dull salmon dish at the summer wedding you didn’t really want to attend in the first place. Still, at least it is recognisable as food. The “tuna carpaccio, radish, lobster vinaigrette, blue spirulina” looks like a plate you’d pick up in a Chania souvenir shop as a memento of a jolly Cretan holiday: petals of all but tasteless purple tuna, laid in a star pattern, are interspersed with dribbles and drops of tasteless sauce in two shades of blue, like Dulux emulsion. There’s a good reason why savoury foods are rarely blue. It’s a plate of wrongness that also tastes of nothingness. (In case you’re wondering, spirulina is a blue-green algae often used as a feed supplement for aquaculture. Doesn’t that just make you purr, “Ooh. Dinner.”) Alongside the poached pear we have a chocolate mousse heavy with the cocktail-bar coffee-tang of Kahlúa, and a bouncy, shuddering coconut panna cotta. So here we sit, in the moodily downlit dining room with its semi-open kitchen and its Stockbridge date-night chatter, trying to work out whether this has been a good experience or not. It is, we conclude, the proverbial curate’s egg: good in parts. Service is friendly and efficient, although our waiter can’t quite cope when I say politely that we’ll fill our glasses ourselves. She insists it’s her job, that she is specifically there to take away the stress of clocking that your wine glass is empty and then lifting a bottle to fill it. Except I find someone filling my glass when I don’t want it filled to be, in itself, stressful. Please, if someone says they’re good with the whole wine glass thing, let them get on with it. Yeah, I know. There are worse problems in the world. I should get over myself. But that’s the point of nice restaurants. They’re meant to be places that keep all those terrible problems at bay. They’re meant to offer something consistent and reliable. But sometimes, as at Merienda, they just leave you scratching your head. News bites Back in the centre of Edinburgh at the Waldorf Astoria Caledonian hotel, there’s Grazing by Mark Greenaway, offering a menu of small, big and sharing plates. Greenaway comes from the fancier end of the restaurant business, but here he’s avoided the overly refined. Instead, he’s knocking out food that’s undeniably clever, but never short on big flavours: try the fried duck egg with duck ham and a confited leg, the gnocchi with parmesan and baby spinach, or a whole shepherd’s pie to share (markgreenaway.com). Stu Deeley, who won MasterChef: The Professionals just before Christmas, is leaving Birmingham restaurant The Wilderness, where he has been head chef since 2017. Deeley, who won with dishes including pork belly with black pudding, langoustine, fennel and yuzu gel, will open his own restaurant in the city later in the year, serving a menu of what he calls ‘Brummie fusion food’. Meanwhile Bristol restaurant The Ethicurean, a former winner of Best Ethical Eats in the OFM awards, has announced it will mark its tenth anniversary by opening a second site at the Trevibban Mill Vineyard near Padstow in Cornwall. It will be open for lunch and dinner and, perhaps unsurprisingly, will offer pairings with wines from the vineyard (theethicurean.com).

My job, if you’re willing to call it one, is not merely to consume food, but also to spend hours hearing about the concepts behind each restaurant. This is where I earn my money: deciphering the arduous Vogon poetics on websites about seasonal produce, the chef’s old nonna, or complete curveballs such as: “You thought you liked cheese... but have you ever tried it delivered on a sushi conveyor belt?” That’s a real thing, by the way, called Pick &amp; Cheese, in Covent Garden. Anyhow, the men behind Pilgrim take concept to a higher, more godly level, basing their restaurant around the pilgrimage routes towards Santiago de Compostela, where the remains of St James were found in the ninth century. Or, more specifically, the Camino del Norte route, which is 825km of rugged coastline between Irun, outside San Sebastian, turning inland at Ribadeo in the Galician hills to Santiago. OK, it’s a Spanish restaurant. And some of the stuff is on small plates, so you could even say it’s tapas, but I like Pilgrim’s swagger. Having grown up around Scousers, never knowingly out of six-foot range of a prayer card, a devotional portrait, or just a plan to go somewhere to worship someone, I find this saint-chasing shtick rather comforting. Especially if it involves Cantabrian boquerones, peralzola cheese, allioli, sofrito, live fire hearths and a lot of cold, white, organic xarel·lo. Pilgrim lives on the upper deck of Duke Street Market, which is what we’re loosely calling right now in restaurant-land “a food hall”, although that’s a catch-all term that doesn’t really work, because the hospitality at each different venue works in a slightly different way. For me, 2019 has been a year of loitering confusedly in food halls, gob ajar, trying to decipher where one eats, sits, orders and pays. Duke Street Market is the first set-up with the stark gumption to put an effusive staff member at the front door chivvying the customers for Asian bowl-food kitchen Ginger or vegan counter Indigo Greens over to the communal benches, while directing Pilgrims like me to the more formal restaurant up a flight of stairs, where a mezzanine overlooks the fun. Because Duke Street Market is definitely fun. Noisy fun. This is a 19th-century warehouse with exposed brick walls and a thunderous sound system. I tried three different tables before accepting that this was going to feel like eating gordal olives during a 1995 Dave Morales set at Cream, but at least this time I would be wearing actual clothes, not merely a Morgan De Toi pelmet and body butter. The trick is to order a large red vermouth on ice as a pre-starter and go with the rumpus. We began with good, fresh house bread with smoked butter and a plate of silver-skinned, delicious boquerones, marinated in sweet vinegar. A plate of fresh, green, defiantly al dente runner beans arrived on a puddle of the deepest, oiliest, most garlicky sofrito strewn with small, piquant, smoked cherry tomatoes. Green beans on red sauce shouldn’t taste that good. Sure, I’d have cooked the beans longer. Same, too for chargrilled leeks. I can only guess that the chef came from a family like mine, where Christmas sprouts were put on to simmer some time in late November, and has spent a culinary journey rebelling. We demolished the leeks nevertheless as they arrived, slathered in light-blue-veined cow’s cheese, scattered with delicately candied walnut. I can’t pretend the food at Pilgrim was perfect; a piece of monkfish tail in a vivid orange pimiento glaze was overcooked and slightly bizarre-tasting. But then a txuleton sirloin, served – no ifs or buts – rare, was a huge success on our table, arriving with a pond-green Castilian salsa heaving with thickly sliced melting onions. Pilgrim is a restaurant I want to return to again and again out of sheer curiosity. Their holy, walking-tour concept doesn’t stifle them, but gives them a clear base for a foray into exquisite produce. The St James tart that Pilgrim served at the end – despite being, dare I say it, “deconstructed” – was one of the greatest things I’ve tasted this year. A slice of sticky, caramelised-edged sponge with a stew of burnt apple and fennel was served with soothing, sweet, milky ice-cream. Not the prettiest of puddings. Not the showiest. A cacophony of beige. Probably not worth walking 825km in sandals for; but if I can travel up the M6 on a Megabus, then I’ll make a pilgrimage again this year. • Pilgrim 46 Duke Street, Liverpool, 07388 120098.

Soups and starters £5.50-£9; mains £8.50-£17; desserts £6; wines from £18 Good things can come from bad. The bad thing in this case was the hopeful but inevitably hopeless trip I made a couple of weeks ago to the Holiday Inn on London’s Cromwell Road. I went for dinner, a word I’d put inside quotation marks to indicate irony, if the whole damn thing hadn’t traumatised the wryness out of me. To recap, I was invited by the executive chef and thought it would be rude to decline; as it turned out, it would have been nowhere near as rude as the boiled egg they served as part of a caesar salad, which had a Shrek-green ring around the yolk through overboiling. I mentioned that the hotel is favoured by cabin crew from Singapore Airlines. One commenter insisted that not all hotel restaurants had to be this way; he said I should try the Bugis Street Brasserie at the nearby Millennium Gloucester Hotel, because that’s where all those Singapore Airlines cabin crew go for a fix of home. It’s named after a key food street in the city state. I have long been suspicious of the notion that you should follow specific ethnic groups to find the good stuff. I have wasted too much money in terrible Chinese restaurants serving gnarly bits of meat harvested from animals that clearly died of old age in cornflour-thickened, viciously over-sweetened sauces just because they happened to be full of Chinese people. Sometimes particular groups cluster in certain places more because it’s a social hub than because the kitchen downstairs has a deft way with the classics. Still, I am forever a starry-eyed optimist. Plus, I have a taste, verging on the obsessive, for a good Singapore laksa, that generous coconut milk-thickened, chilli-slicked broth, stacked with noodles, seafood, chicken and various other bits and bobs, which make life worth living. If there was the possibility of one of those in my future, Bugis Street demanded my attention. The Millennium Gloucester is a beautiful piece of architecture, if your idea of beauty extends to Stalinist-era pre-stressed grey concrete monoliths of the sort built to house sound-proofed interrogation centres. No matter. I was planning to be inside it, eating, rather than outside squinting at the facade. The restaurant is reached by its own entrance around the corner from the hotel’s main door. It was only when I wandered round there that I clocked its location literally behind the Holiday Inn, for those cabin crew in desperate need of sanctuary. It’s the right place to seek it, though not because of the room. It is a masterful study in beige. Ceiling fans beat unnecessarily at the cool air of a London summer to summon up a tropical vibe, and there are wooden slatted screens on some of the windows. Ignore this. All the colour and drama will be on the table in front of you. It starts with their chicken satay. These are not the compressed cysts of tortured animal protein impaled on cocktail sticks and dyed yellow that fester in supermarket chiller cabinets across the land. These are smoky pieces of heavily spice-rubbed thigh, the occasional tassels of skin fired to crisp on the grill. There are singed bits and golden bits and roasted bits. With them is the requisite sauce that hits you first with the sweetness of peanut, but which keeps going with layers of spice and aromatics. At first you try to be refined, dipping the chicken in the sauce daintily. Then you take to dragging it through the bowl enthusiastically. Finally, you’re leaving the pieces of chicken on the plate and spooning the sauce over the top. There are, as there should be, cooling pieces of cucumber to settle everything down. From the list headed “Bugis Signatures” comes the classic nasi goreng, a huge plate of rust-coloured rice, mined with spiced chicken, prawns and a few peas for colour and pop, then topped with a fried egg, the yolk from which is just waiting to be pierced. With it comes a deep red sambal with huge toasted chilli notes with which to lubricate the rice and bring out the odd bead of sweat. And then, of course, there is the laksa. Oh, the laksa. If, like me, you have a mental laksa map, a geographical plotting of the best places for the dish, drop a pin for this one. The thicker rice noodles take me by surprise; I’m used to thinner vermicelli, but these have a satisfying slurp. The broth is not overly sweetened. It’s a huge bash of chilli and stock and coconut. It bobs with prawns that have the bite of seafood cooked through only in the hot broth once it hit the bowl. I slurp and sip and dig about very happily. Singapore has long been a culinary crossroads, with ethnic groups being washed ashore in waves and bringing with them their food. So here is a terrifying-looking Malaysian chicken curry made with thigh served on the bone, in a bright red liquor beneath a surface puddle of orange oil perhaps half a centimetre deep. I worry it will be grim and greasy to eat, but it’s nothing of the sort. The pungent gravy seems to emulsify as it gets in your bowl. We have Nyonya pork, in a dark sauce full of cracked black pepper and sweet chilli. From a list of specials awaiting us on the table come chunks of long-braised pork belly, with jelly-like fat, served in a clay pot that’s so hot, the black sauce is still bubbling and spitting at us when it lands. It is a dish for which the words “yes please” were invented. The picture-led dessert menu offers a bunch of slightly worrying things, involving slippery bean curd or sweetened red-bean paste. We retreat to the safety of banana fritters in a palm sugar syrup. It’s unneeded and all the better for that. We drink very little, but there are beers and solid-looking wines for those who want them. Most dishes are priced from around a tenner and into the low teens, alongside set menu options for £12. It’s the sort of place where people come alone at lunchtime for a single plate of good food, and feel very comfortable doing so. If it were relevant, I might tell you it’s packed with people from South East Asia. That happens to be so. But it’s far more useful to know that its true claim on your attention goes far beyond simply being better than the Holiday Inn across the road. News bites The Greyhound Café, the first London branch of a well-known Bangkok group, offers a sprightly, expansive take on the Thai repertoire. The dish names can be a little tiresome – there’s Salmon in Hot Pursuit, Bugs in My Salad, and Angry Pasta – but it’s all worth your time. The German style pork knuckle with a kicking tamarind curry paste is a standout, as is the Tom Yum soup with tiger prawns and prawn-stuffed dumplings. The Stockport Produce Hall, a site for various street food-style stands, has been criticised for not including enough independent traders in its repertoire, in favour of large-scale restaurant brands. Now they’ve announced that the brilliant Cambodian restaurant Angkor Soul from nearby Marple, will, have a presence there from this month. And on a similar subject Market Halls, which already operates ‘multi-vendor’ food courts in London’s Fulham and Victoria has received £20 million of backing from equity firm Bridgepoint Growth, to roll the model out across the country. If the street food movement was once to the restaurant business what indie record labels once were to the majors, that moment appears to be passing.

It transpired that the man cooking my dinner at Bank House had never been a member of New Edition; he was, however, once former head chef at well-liked Tunbridge Wells restaurant The Kentish Hare. Last time I went to Tunbridge Wells, I was charged just short of £200 to stay one night in a Hotel Du Vin room so small, I had to edge around the bed to open the window. I ate at the quite lovely Don Giovanni on Calverley Road after fleeing the hotel when a request to move from a crap, creaky, draughty table was met with a blank “no”. Thankfully, for me at least, one of the area’s best chefs seems to have now moved to Chislehurst, a suburban district of south-east London so charming that when I arrived on Saturday evening, having driven only a few short miles through the Blackwall Tunnel from my east London home, it felt like going on holiday. “The air is so clean! Let’s move to Chislehurst – this is a magical place!” I trilled as we slipped into a handsome, repurposed Victorian building. A former bank, it has recently been taken over by Stuart Gillies, who was once CEO of Gordon Ramsay’s entire fleet and, for that reason, feasibly has a photograph of me on his desk complete with scribbled devil horns and a Beelzebub tail. Here, Gillies has gone out on his own and opened an incredibly decent neighbourhood wine bar and restaurant with which I really cannot quibble. Bank House is unpretentious, welcoming and warm-spirited. It’s a proper Saturday night, do-your-hair-pretty, put-on-a-shirt kind of place, with an eye for detail and an imaginative menu. Service is brilliant: well-trained, unobtrusive and cheery. And it does half portions of everything for kids on a weekend. The skin-on, triple-cooked chips are doused in chicken-skin salt. The tiger prawns come with a harissa that will knock your socks off. It serves Royal Tokaji Late Harvest by the glass. You can’t ask for more than that from a local joint. Plates of smoked anchovies arrive swimming in good olive oil, while fiery ’nduja comes smeared on toasted sourdough. Baked crab gratin with crostini sits on the brief yet meaningful menu beside pork belly sliders with a well-judged pickled slaw. The house cocktail that evening was a brulee flip with cognac and hazelnut liqueur, which was fiendishly drinkable. Why don’t more local places do this? There is a middle ground between “house burger” and “excruciating tasting menu”, and Bank House has nailed it. Buttermilk chicken appears in a crisp, tempura batter and smothered in barbecue sauce, blue cheese and spring onion. Said out loud, that sounds like a physical assault, but no, it was marvellous: just the right amount of sweetness, sharpness, crunch and smoothness. So much so that we consider ordering it again for pudding. Fillet of plaice sits in a buttery sauce flecked with beetroot and minutely diced parmesan. Again, in the wrong hands this could be vile, but by this point I trusted chef Bobby Brown implicitly. The beetroot was sweet, the parmesan soft and salty, the plaice perfectly judged and a nice refuge from both extremes. I sense that Brown has many haywire ideas in the kitchen that the staff have learned just to go with. By 8pm, the restaurant had filled up with couples on date nights, tables of blokes who once raved together but now prefer a Courvoisier and an early night, plus the local great and good. Bank House is the sort of place Rodney would take Cassandra in February for their 31st wedding anniversary. He’d whisk her eight miles down the A208 to somewhere a bit posh, but not too arsey. They’d have the Creedy Carver Duck and a side of what the menu calls “stealth fries” – they’re basically thin chips, thus named so you can eat them secretly without your metabolism knowing about them. Bobby Brown is in residency in Chislehurst serving freshly baked bakewell tart with non-faffed-about-with, plain old clotted cream, and Madagascan vanilla cheesecake. The portions of both are quite healthy. Two can play that game. • Bank House 11 High Street, Chislehurst BR7, 020-8249 0461. Open all week 11.30am-10.30pm (6pm Sun).

The arrival of Siren, a fish restaurant by the Cornish chef Nathan Outlaw, was therefore something of a surprise. Surely this would only attract, well, the public? (Please read “the public” in the manner of Downton Abbey’s dowager countess discovering “the weekend”.) Forgive my pearl-clutching, but the Goring has enjoyed a century of discreetly hosting minor aristocrats, anglophile Manhattan elite and royal wedding guest overspill. Then, bang, Nathan Outlaw is here. Him off the telly with a name that suggests he ought to be waving a cutlass in the 4pm pirate show at the Treasure Island Hotel in Las Vegas. But worry not, upholders of British standards, the Goring post-Outlaw is still delightfully quaint. On a Friday afternoon, the bar and drawing rooms are still a hive to retired sergeant majors in nipple-waisted chinos and drinking Tom Collinses, genteel tourists pondering the cream-before-jam debate, and staff in top hats, velour jackets and fancy brooches, as well as people like me: one very good gimlet down by 1pm, and keen to know if this throttlingly expensive collaboration is just another sterile hotel space to avoid. Because that’s the rub with almost all “fancy incoming chef” versus “nosebleedingly expensive hotel” square-offs: they’re usually bloody dull. In fact, when I go to hell – restaurant critics do not enter heaven – my eternity will be to endure an endless tasting menu while trapped in a glass-fronted room adjoining a fancy hotel foyer. My room mates will be moneyed, jetlagged diners who long for a house burger but were fooled into ordering velouté of endive avec doe cheek confit. But I’m pleased to inform you that hell is certainly not Siren. It is entirely the opposite. Outlaw’s rugged charm is the perfect foil to the Goring’s dainty aloofness. They go together like fish and chips – albeit here that means turbot at £42 a piece and chips that are triple-cooked, skin-on spuds with garlic and rosemary. Siren’s menu eschews jargon or trend, but still retains a sparkle. You will be fed by the end of your meal. Feasibly thoroughly skint, too, but fed nonetheless. Expect crisp oysters and thick slabs of cuttlefish black pudding. Dover sole is served with a clotted cream sauce. Hake comes battered. There’s dry-aged steak with tarragon butter. Alongside the daily menu, a silver tray of recently departed fish will be delivered to your table for you to behold and pick from. If you’re vegan, vegetarian, allergic or just delicate, tell them: the staff are amazing. They will solve any dining woes. Proceedings begin with a mini-loaf of St John bread with glorious seaweed butter and a plentiful bowl of thick, pink and smoky cod’s roe. This, armed with a cold bottle of 2018 Domaine du Peras sauvignon blanc, would have been a damned good lunch in its own right. Especially because the garden-facing dining room is possibly – no, hesitation be damned – definitely London’s prettiest restaurant-with-a-view of the year. If you’re painfully well-organised, book now for Valentine’s 2020. The person will marry you. Even if they don’t especially like you. Siren is an open-fronted space, on dry days at least, that gazes out on a quintessential British country-house lawn. The room is filled with beautiful, green, leafy-cushioned chairs, with notes of terracotta, rich browns and ermine blues. Glass lobsters loom from the ceiling while matching sea anenomes perch on the tables. We ate a delicate lobster tart that was something of a work of art, sturdy enough to contain a lot of meat and a tower of fresh pea shoots, yet deft and flyaway, too. A starter of cured monkfish was a subtle affair, ornately arranged with fresh ginger, fennel and yoghurt. The crisp oysters were a punchier option, layered with cabbage and served with an oyster-infused “salad cream”. Turbot on the bone was perfectly judged, with a vibrant, sunrise-coloured seaweed hollandaise and a slice of al dente, chargrilled fennel. A 910g sea bass arrived partially skinned, yet still very much owning a skeleton, and its face stared plaintively up at Charles as he deboned and demolished it. Puddings are exquisite, too; in fact, for me, they were the stars of the show, even though they begin at 12 quid for ice-cream. A heroically gorgeous strawberry tart with a Jenga-pile of fresh fruit and a scoop of yoghurt sorbet was bliss. The raspberry choux bun is a decadent heffalump of a dessert, teeming with plump berries and equipped with a jug of dark chocolate sauce. A glass of sweet Uroulat jurançon took the edge off the alarming bill. Siren lured me in and seduced me. Things got very rocky. • Siren The Goring Hotel, 15 Beeston Place, London SW1, 020-7396 9000.

Full disclosure: I do not need martial law to make me enjoy shopping-centre food. I eat a lot in what the kids are calling malls. I’m in there frequently, mooching, running errands and generally hiding from life. It is, of course, fashionable to express dismay about any time spent inside these neon-lit retail kingdoms, and about their food offerings in particular. Nevertheless, as Christmas approaches, be sure that you will at some point find yourself in a multi-storey car park gridlock while heading to the festive stampede for Victoria’s Secret’s two-for-one gift thongs, which is when the likes of massaman curry at Rosa’s Thai will suddenly feel like refuge. As will the weeping tiger jay tofu at Busaba, or even just a pleasant scone in the Waitrose cafe while observing jabby-elbowed cardholders rinsing the free coffees. You will, no doubt, have your own personal pockets of shopping-centre joy, which I am more than willing to hear about. Westfield Stratford also boasts a Pasta Remoli that is constantly mobbed, and the small, independently run Cafe Rasa, which serves half-decent roti canai. Tapas Revolution has taken the slot vacated by Cafe Football, Ryan Giggs and Gary Neville’s awful, multi-screened, overpriced novelty burger restaurant; it is also close to the now permanently shut Levi Roots’ Caribbean Smokehouse and just along from a Jamie’s Italian (RIP). Tapas Revolution is Omar Allibhoy’s seventh shopping centre opening since he burst on to the scene with his lovely hair, El Bulli namedropping and doing a neat line in recipe books and Saturday morning TV appearances. Each time one of these brands shuts its doors, I’m asked, as an expert, to guess why, and each time I reply, with heartfelt brevity, “Because the food was atrocious”. To which I’m informed, “No, it must be more complex than that”, and we then have to dance around the economy, millennials, vegans, health’n’safety and supermarket meal deals. “Well, yes,” I reply, “but really it’s the food. People don’t get fooled twice.” I didn’t rush back to Cafe Football after the £18 pie with matchstick fries, and I won’t be going back to Tapas Revolution, either, not after the churros they served me: sad, tasteless turds of dough, deep-fried in jaded oil and served with a jar of separated cocoa and water masquerading as chocolate dipping sauce. No amount of fish-bowl gin and tonic can hide this. Churros – fat, fresh, delicious, hot, with sticky, calorific, pant-expanding chocolate sauce – are now available in every food market. Diners have travelled; they know what they want. I’d eaten more authentic cod bacalao con alioli, and in more charmingly Spanish surroundings, the week before on a cruise ship a mile outside Hamburg. Tapas Revolution’s unlovable cod fritters had feasibly been fried in the same oil as the churros, and came with a highly subtle saffron mayo. Beef on skewers, pinchos morunos con mojo picón, were tender enough, but gave away nothing of the grill. Soggy pan con tomate. Weird, oily paella. Crispy fried aubergine with muscovado syrup arrived in huge, fierce chunks resembling oven chips and the syrup was predictably teeth-jarring. There are great ideas and good intent hiding somewhere in this growing chain, but in the rush to expand and feed the masses, flavour and care have taken a hit. In its first few weeks of opening, Tapas Revolution Westfield was jam-packed with Instagram influencers necking watermelon sangria on the only two nice tables. A flurry of public relations people supervised them, alongside the owner, the owner’s friends and many other people on jollies who seemed willing to believe that anything was delicious in return for free gambas al ajillo, which here were poor-quality, oily prawns in an earthenware bowl. Tapas Revolution is like being on holiday in Andalusia, wandering into a local restaurant, and then being punished incrementally for Brexit via terrible service and things from the bottom of the freezer. Come the revolution, I’ll be eating yaki udon at Wagamama in the food court. • Tapas Revolution 145 The Street, Westfield Stratford City, London E20, 020-8221 1437.

Small plates £5-£7.50, larger plates £9-£11, desserts £4-£5.50, wines from £25 Shortly after sitting down at Bubala, I felt a chill breeze. I looked across to the front door, which was flapping open. As a customer left, they pulled it shut behind them. It sprung open again, just enough to let in a gust of frigid air. I studied the narrow, L-shaped dining room with its textured walls in light shades of oatmeal, and its bar tiled in jade green, and its hard-wooden banquettes, with their sky-blue panels.

I thought I recognised that cold wind. Exactly two years ago I sat in this very same dining room, on Commercial Street in east London. Back then it was an ill-conceived modish Indian restaurant, limbering up to die. In that review I also whined about the door. “Efficiently, on a cold November lunchtime,” I wrote, “the open front door channels chilly air right to the back corner. We ask for it to be closed more than once.” Here then, is the one message I would love the management of Bubala to take away from this review. Rehang the bloody door. Take it off its hinges and loosen them. It will never close properly unless you do so and your diners will be cold throughout the winter and do you really want me to sit here and freeze my tuchus off? The small lurch into Yiddish is appropriate. Bubala is roughly the Yiddish for sweetheart or darling. It’s what a mother calls her child; what a husband calls his wife. Yiddish is the language of the Ashkenazi Jews of central and eastern Europe. And yet the menu at Bubala concerns itself with food from the far eastern Mediterranean and Spain, which I associate with the Sephardim. Certainly, do not come here looking for a salt-beef bagel. Indeed, do not come here looking for any meat at all. It is entirely, robustly, exuberantly vegetarian. The menu may reference ingredients you have never heard of. Still, in an age dominated by the great Yotam Ottolenghi we are all skilled at nodding sagely at such things, to indicate we get the drift, if not the details. Labneh Schabneh as no one has ever said, until now. We order their pickles, to crunch away at while we blink at the menu. There are taut quarters of green tomato, and slabs of carrot in a sweet-sour brine with the lofty aromatics of cumin. Their take on hummus, whipped up with brown butter and tahini, arrives with an indentation filled with olive oil, chickpeas, toasted pine nuts and roughly chopped parsley. It is smooth and close to a light peanut butter. Next to this is a pumpkin tirshy, a Moroccan dip the colour of a dying sun, with the acidity of preserved lemons, the fire of harissa and the light bitterness of kalamata olives. We worry that we do not have enough of their pillowy, singed flatbread to do these dishes justice. Somehow, we manage. There is still-warm falafel with a puddle of whipped tahini and crimson strands of pickled onion. There are discs of aubergine, long-roasted until the skins are almost crisp and chewy, then dressed with heaps of a sharp coriander relish called zhoug. Oh yes, tonight I am learning many new words. A long plank of mellow halloumi comes crisply fried and dressed with black-seed honey. People will tell you breathlessly that this particular honey, infused with the likes of nigella and black cumin seed, will protect you from cancer. Yeah, whatever. You only need to know it’s lovely on halloumi; if you have a cold, try a Lemsip. A chunk of cabbage comes seared and blackened and pelted with pomegranate, hazelnuts and tahini by a kitchen that has never heard the phrase “enough already”. It doesn’t need to because it’s a delightfully messy dish. A lump of green romanesco cauliflower is less than fiercely cooked. We have to ask whether they have anything approaching a steak knife. They find something. Even then, we send part of it flying across the table in a splat of smoked tomato sauce punched up with ras el hanout. When we get it all back on to the plate it’s another strong and satisfying mess. I have to take issue with one menu description: confit potato latkes. I know latkes, and latkes these ain’t. A latke demands grated potato, egg, perhaps a little chopped onion. They are ill-shaped dollops of crisp-fried potato. What they serve at Bubala are geometric blocks of finely sliced confited potato, pressed and then deep fried, which originated at the Quality Chop House on the Farringdon Road. They’re great. Of course they are. They’re deep-fried pieces of already confited potato. How could they not be great? The sprinkling of Aleppo chilli adds an encouraging kick. But latkes, they are not. The one real letdown is dessert. It’s ices. It’s very nice ices, but just ices all the same. There’s an enthusiastically refreshing coconut and cardamom sorbet on plums roasted with the purple citrus spring of sumac, all of it scattered with grated coconut. There’s a brilliant date and tangerine ice-cream dribbled with more tahini. (Can you imagine how much tahini they get through in a week here? I hope they’re investing in sesame futures.) But at this point, what you want is friable pastries; something made with crushed nuts and syrup and orange blossom, and maybe sweetened cream cheese. What you want is the dessert menu from Honey &amp; Co over on Warren Street. There are squidgy chocolate truffles, four of them, but they are no substitute for syrup-soaked loveliness. Because there is no meat or fish on the menu, prices stay down. Most dishes are between £5 and £7.50 with nothing above £11. You can inflate the bill with a cocktail or two or by shopping up the wine list, but, even then, there’s a significant choice by the glass. Bubala would be close to perfect if they got themselves a pastry chef. And if they rehung that damn door, which is still flapping open and closed as we leave, with the staff gamely putting their shoulder into it as if to show willing. It didn’t really matter when it was the previous restaurant, but with this one it does. Bubala deserves to last. News bites If you want to eat in a restaurant where the clientele may well call each other bubala for real, try Tish in Belsize Park, a kosher brasserie. The menu is broadly European but they know their clientele, so go there for the chicken soup, the salt beef sandwich, the (real) latkes and the lokshen pudding, which may be like your mother makes, depending on your mother (tish.london). New restaurants rarely launch in the first week of January. Traditionally it’s a time when businesses stay closed, on account of the post-festive lull. Let’s hear it then for newcomer 28 Market Place, which opens for business in Somerton, Somerset on 3 January. The new venture from Ben and Vanessa Crofton, late of the Soho House group, will have Dan Fletcher, formerly of The Square in London’s Mayfair, running the kitchen (28marketplace.co.uk). Amid the avalanche of books released around now, promising to enable you to eat anything you like and never put on weight ever again, one new title catches my eye, for ambition alone. It’s called 100 Recipes to Live to 100 by Dan Buettner and is published on 9 January. Check in with me in September 2066 to see whether it worked.

To reach this precious Yemeni coffee, I had to pass through an earnest 300-person queue for Hawker Chan, a Michelin-starred noodle seller who had set up, for three days only, close to Ducasse’s cafe. As I drank my coffee, at approximately £1.50 a sip, observing foodies in their element, it struck me that London is not short of suggestible idiots. Myself included. “Can you taste the bergamot orange? The cocoa nibs?” asked the barista in evangelical tones. “Yes, I can,” I said, thinking that from now on I will only imbibe coffee beans which have been exported in limited quantities from smallholder farmers in war-torn Yemen through military checkpoints. I’ve been mugging myself off until now. Suddenly drinking my Gold Blend when on deadline felt like self-sabotage. “And then can you taste grape,” the barista said. “Some red berries and notes of honey.” “All of this,” I said, because in that moment, I truly could. The complimentary freshly baked madeleine helped things along, plus the tiny square of Ducasse Madagascan dark chocolate, both offered to accentuate the beverage’s flavours. Don’t expect this coffee to be slung at you in a paper cup with your name misspelled. No, set aside half an hour, pull up a chair: this is a delicate ceremony involving several men in slate-blue, cassock-style uniforms noodling over electronic scales and state-of-the-art grinding equipment. It will involve invitations to smell the Yemeni beans and compare and contrast with those from Ethiopia and Panama, then the hallowed liquid will be decanted into a conical flask and poured delicately into a glass cup. It’s all very convivial. Whether this nose-bleedingly expensive coffee is delicious, rich, pungent and captivating isn’t the question. This is a damn fine brew. Whether it’s worth £15 to spend 20-30 minutes at a small elegant bar surrounded by coffee musos is the question. By London standards, to my mind at least, less than £20 for an “experience” feels almost reasonable. Just up the road at King’s Cross platform 9 and three quarters, it costs £15 for a child to queue-jump and be photographed by Harry Potter’s trolley. As I left Ducasse, high as a kite on caffeine, having made a load of new chums at the counter, I realised you couldn’t put a price tag on this level of smugness.','https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/mar/08/grace-dent-reviews-alain-ducasse-15-pound-cup-of-coffee','Grace Dent','''Damn fine''',-0.126388317994952925,51.5354977898960768,0.0258);

My Neighbours The Dumplings sounds like a post-post-punk group featuring Jah Wobble and ex-members of Gang of Four. It also sounds like a disrespectful jibe about the people over the fence post-Christmas. But My Neighbours The Dumplings, which opened in Clapton, east London, some years back, and which has recently opened a second, roomier restaurant in Victoria Park, Hackney, is in fact named after the 1998 cult Japanese anime film My Neighbour Toroto. That has to be the most impudently east-London thing I’ll write in 2019, but there are 11 weeks left. Three years ago, with that brilliant name acting as catnip, I fought my way into Kristian Leontiou and Becky Wharton’s first dumpling and sake bar to find the place in absolute bedlam. Delicious, homespun, sort-of-Chinese, sort-of-Korean, a-little-Vietnamese bedlam. But also the sort of bedlam that sets in when your pop-up events and baskets of crisp, chewy, courgette and wood-ear mushroom potstickers are a sell-out success and Nigella’s been in for a plate of your prawn har gow. It was the sort of bedlam that brings all the cool kids to the melee, like wasps to jam, and turns your waiting area into a 50-minute queue for smacked cucumber and turnip cake. I remember leaving feeling that it was wonderful, and that drinking sake cocktails in its pot-plant jungle was a real coup, but still, I’d eaten dinner with one bum cheek on a stranger’s thigh and my elbow in their peanut salad. I was impressed, but would never go back. We hear lots these days about restaurants withering due to lack of interest, but what do you do when you’re loved to the point that your walls can barely contain you? “So this is what stupid people look like,” Becky Wharton wrote on My Neighbours The Dumplings’ Instagram last April, revealing these new premises. “Two kids and two restaurants in three years!” Cut to a drab, very early Tuesday evening in early October, and we are eating alone in the all-new, bigger and, I think, better My Neighbours The Dumplings. We go at 5pm, managing to miss not only the hip things, but also the parents with toddlers who began to fill up the benches later. This suits me fine: the new residence is a gorgeous expanse of elegant calm. More beautiful, more, dare I say, grown-up than the first. It’s twinkly, inviting and date-nightish. Or, in our case, date-late-afternoonish. On one side, banqueting benches sit under explosions of greenery and a cacophony of lanterns and knick-knacks; on the other, a small dumpling kitchen. Trung Nguyen and master dumpling chef Carol Lee supervise the making of around 14,000 dumplings a week over the two sites. I think they may have nailed the perfect crisp, moist potsticker. You may know them as gyoza. I once heard potstickers called “Peking ravioli” in America. It’s no surprise they’re also nicknamed “the gateway dumpling” by some, because, even if you’re not in the mood for Asian food, they’ll change your mind. Here, the vegetable potstickers are a punchy blend of shiitake, cabbage, chive and sesame. Next up, a thrilling basket of Cantonese crystal shrimp dumplings, or har gow, are the best I’ve had in London. They are firm, satisfying bullets of joy, with stretchy, nigh-translucent skins, masking a buoyant whack of pink prawn, sesame and oyster sauce. We are supposed to be pacing ourselves, but quickly order another basket from the chipper staff. We steer ourselves away from dumplings to the other small plates: a bowl of delightful pickled wood-ear mushrooms with goji berries and matchsticks of apple is fabulous and a great foil for a soothing, unusual cold plate of marinated silken tofu littered with preserved vegetables and pine nuts in a puddle of tamari. Yakitori skewers of line-caught mackerel, grilled with lime and sake, are a delight. Possibly my least favourite dish is the fanciest and most expensive: a tartare of hamachi yellowtail on avocado mush looks charming on the menu photo, but makes little impact on my tastebuds. If you go, which I think you should, order the chocolate dumplings. Yes, it’s only a basket of unglamorous spring rolls filled with dark chocolate goo and served with a salted caramel dipping sauce and a scoop of ice-cream, but winter is coming and we all need extra fat to keep warm. Go early, beat the rush, order the har gow. That’s how good neighbours become good friends. • My Neighbours The Dumplings 178-180 Victoria Park Road, London, E9, 020-3327 0447.

The Betterment sounds like a Gwyneth Paltrow home-learning seminar series, where for $800 you can learn six life-enhancing ways to arrange a radish plate. The Betterment is, in fact, the new restaurant from Jason Atherton, who, like the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, now also has an empire that the sun never sets on. Atherton is everywhere in London, and he’s in Shanghai, Dubai, Doha, New York, Cebu and St Moritz, too; doing everything all of the time, excelling at innovative, dramatic cocktails and luxury dining that doesn’t befuddle. He spreads himself thin and aims big, never truly messing up, and never looking anything less than bushy-tailed and dapper in public. This has led me to wonder if there are three, or possibly four, Jason Athertons out there, and if so, one of them is hellbent on incessantly winding up his former employer, Gordon Ramsay. This may well be why Atherton’s newest place is directly opposite Ramsay’s ironically titled Lucky Cat, which I’d rather dine on a Felix duck and lamb in jelly wet pouch than visit again. More sensibly, Atherton is a master at choosing and delegating to great staff. Here, chef Paul Walsh, ex of City Social, and the diligent front-of-house team make what could have been a stiff, corporate-focused, fine-dining borefest into a thoroughly acceptable night. In any other top-name chef’s mitts, The Betterment, inside the The Biltmore hotel on Grosvenor Square, could be a horrible mess, regardless of the steak tartare with beef dripping croutons the size of roast potatoes or the very delicious onion “flower” with chive emulsion (it’s a deep-fried onion, splayed to resemble a sort of floral octopus, with fancy mayo, and definitely a must-order). Nevertheless, the Biltmore is the sort of hotel no one who is remotely from Planet Earth ever stays at. It’s a vast, showy, 251-room, 57-suite luxury, Hilton LXR collection, Mayfair rich-person’s mothership, close to Selfridge’s, where the rooms start at £600 a night and you’d stay only if money was simply an airy concept over which you heard other people worry. The Betterment, to be blunt, is a slice off the back end of this. In fact, if you’re sitting in its very prettiest, starriest section – al fresco, under heaters, romantically lit, next to an Instagram hotspot greenery wall – it will strike you after a while that you’re essentially sitting in a repurposed car park, watching hotel guests arrive and leave. Some of the inside tables, closest to the front of the hotel, are awful, like a drab, grey breakfast room. But I did enjoy The Betterment, and I would go back. It is a new place with old-school glamour, with receptionists in off-the-shoulder LBDs and handsome, besuited males foisting warm sourdough and salted butter under your nose, following on from a cocktail containing something strong with Dubonnet and Silent Pool gin and named Tea Time With The Queen. With dinner, I drank the cheapest Can Sumoi Xarel·lo at £12 a glass, and well aware that this was possibly disappointing for the sommelier. Our meal is much more hearty than the menu suggests, because on paper it is a cacophony of snow pea, langoustine crudo and horseradish velouté. In actuality, chalk steam trout and potato cake with curry sauce is a tarted-up fishcake in a puddle of light, coronation-style liquor: delicate, fishy and finickity in design, but still dinner. John dory with a sauce of coco de Paimpol beans and bordelaise sauce is really very little to get het up about. Short-rib with Montgomery cheddar does exactly what it promises: it is an assertive, umami-heavy, emotional battering of bone marrow-encrusted, meaty, cheesy decadence; if you have that with the fried onion and some of The Betterment’s “chips”, which are fried in beef dripping and come with a ketchup laced with truffle, you may find yourself in need of a sedan chair. This won’t be aided by a slice of the generously portioned dark chocolate tart with glorious, deeply scented Tahitian vanilla ice-cream, which I thought to be world-class. Jason Atherton may not have opened the best restaurant in the West End of London this year, but he has opened a more delicious one than Gordon Ramsay. The battle isn’t over, but this time Atherton has got The Betterment of him. • The Betterment 44 Grosvenor Square, London W1, 020-7596 3200. Open all week, lunch noon-2.30pm, dinner 6-10.30pm.

Starters £14-£16, mains £26-£30, desserts £9.50, wines from £38 Dangling on a chain from the waitress’s outfits at the Yard by Robin Gill, the restaurant tucked inside the new Great Scotland Yard Hotel just off London’s Whitehall, is a knuckle-duster. We ask to weigh one in our hand. It’s the real thing: a solid piece of brass designed for rupturing skin and fracturing bone in a moment of ultra-violence. It’s a nasty weapon repurposed as an oh-so-witty fashion accessory. I suggest you consider that a symbol for everything that’s wrong about this unappealing, ill-conceived and graspingly overpriced catering operation. It’s a head-scratcher. The Yard may well be the worst new restaurant from a critically acclaimed chef I have ever reviewed. Robin Gill has been widely praised for the good-value, boisterous cooking at the Dairy and Sorella in Clapham and for Darby’s, a New York-inspired oyster and steak place close to the new American Embassy. I loved his now closed Paradise Garage. And now his name is all over this demonstration of the misguided in three courses. Then again, the restaurant is only described as being under his “guidance”. Perhaps it’s just some consultancy job; an irresistible shake of the big fat money tree, which meant he didn’t argue when someone suggested he charge £26 for a dreary plate of fried dough and cauliflower. We’ll come back to that. As the name implies, the Great Scotland Yard Hotel by Hyatt occupies the building that was once the headquarters of the Metropolitan Police. Foul crimes were investigated here. Suspects implicated in appalling murders were detained here. A nod to that makes sense, but they’ve gone all in. I find the glass case in the foyer with an antique police truncheon disconcerting; likewise, the poor waiters’ Peaky Blinders-vintage utility-wear “costumes”. You can spot who the most senior staff are. Their trousers are allowed to reach their shoes; the others have to wear them rolled above the ankle. More troubling is the display of paintings and sculpture by current UK prison inmates, purchased from the charity Koestler Arts, which helps people in the criminal justice system change their lives through art. Rehabilitation through art is obviously laudable. So is the sale of that often-harrowing work. But context is everything. Here they sit, these expressions of isolation, of broken families, emotional trauma and dismal consequence, bang outside the door to a restaurant charging £15 for starters and £30 for mains; where wines start at £38 a bottle. Here, the art doesn’t feel transformative. It feels exploitative. Oh look! How profound. How moving. Now let’s go spaff £75 a head on dinner. Not that I was aware of the cost because unusually, at opening, they hadn’t posted the menu online, perhaps because the pricing is so at odds with everything else Gill has done. Most of the dishes at the Dairy are roughly half the price of those here. As ever, the money could be justified if it was all “praise be” and “hallelujah”, and there are a couple of dishes that get the nod. There’s a very jolly long-cooked pork jowl, pan-burnished, sticky-glazed and laid under a crisp crumb; a louche version of a Japanese tonkatsu breaded pork cutlet. It’s £28. There’s a clever chocolate mousse in a crisp pastry shell and a lemon custard tart with sticks of meringue and mascarpone ice-cream. Both feel like consolation prizes. Both are £9.50. Other things make us joke that the building where crimes were once investigated, is now where they are being committed. Too often the kitchen tries to declare victory through the application of dairy fats. To start we are given a cup of a ludicrously creamy Jerusalem artichoke soup, which they’ve attempted to make interesting via the tiresome punch of truffle oil. It reminds me of the savoury “cappuccinos” that were served in fancy Mayfair restaurants back at the turn of the millennium, and not in a fond way. A sea bass ceviche should be about acidity and sprightliness. Here the thinly sliced fish wallows in a pond of creamy sauce. There is none of the advertised wasabi hit, no citrus punch. Most infuriating is a £14 bowl of curling cavatelli pasta, on a cloyingly sweet pumpkin sauce with amaretto and underpickled Thai shallots that are more sugar than acid. It’s 2020 and the vegetarian option is: a bowl of bloody pasta. Gill is better than this. Meanwhile, the cream-ballasted sauce around a well-made beef short rib raviolo leaves us reeling from buttery overkill. It’s the vegetarian main that has me eyeing the knuckle-dusters; don’t blame me, I’m not the one who put weapons in the dining room. It’s a plate of doughy fried gnocchi like those dental swabs inserted between teeth and gum. They come with roasted cauliflower florets, leaves which are less bitter than we’re quickly becoming, and that £26 price tag. It tastes of laziness and gross profit margin. The main courses top out at £30, for two small pieces of monkfish with XO sauce, a condiment that makes me think lunch up the road in Chinatown would be delightful right now. The desserts include a deconstructed tarte tatin. The point of a tarte tatin is the sticky, caramelised edges to the buttery pastry from the roasted apples and sugar. If you serve the pastry separately, it’s just a disc of dry pastry, however clever the undulations you’ve achieved. Stop it. The bill for three arrives. It’s an asphyxiating £288. I squint at it. They appear to have charged me £75 for a £39 bottle of white Burgundy. I question this. The mistake, it seems, is all mine. When I pointed at the £39 price tag and said “I’ll have a bottle of that” I didn’t clock that £39 was actually for a half-bottle carafe, because I am simple and do not understand the cost of things. Equally, they didn’t point out my error. I say fine, I’ll pay, but they insist on charging me only £39 because of the “confusion”. Obviously, this has nothing to do with who I am. The bill returns and, because this is a hotel restaurant, as well as adding a 12.5% service charge of £27.50, they have left open a space for an extra tip. I decline to pay more – £82.50 each is already taking the piss and my bladder is completely empty. Would somebody mind calling the emergency services? News bites For a more successful take on the hotel restaurant, try chef Tristan Welch’s British brasserie at the Parker’s Tavern, inside the University Arms, Cambridge. This is robust, unprissy cooking: it’s fishcakes with lemon butter sauce or truffled duck egg on toast; it’s nut-brown buttered sole with brown shrimps or braised suckling pig with crackling and braised fennel. At the end there’s a Cambridge burnt cream or pink rhubarb and ginger cheesecake. Prices are reasonable and banquettes, accommodating (parkerstavern.com) Farewell then, to Petit Pois Bistro, in London’s Hoxton Square, which served the best chocolate mousse in town and was much loved. After nearly four years it has closed, though the owners retain the site and say they will be opening something else there soon. Meanwhile Monsieur Le Duck, which went from duck-themed pop-up to permanent, has closed its Clerkenwell site after less than a year. They say they are looking for new premises.

And lifesized models of samurai warriors by the urinals in the gents,” I rock and gibber. “And you can eat sashimi in black garlic and yuzu foam while overlooking St Paul’s Cathedral. And they have a pudding with chocolate soil and samurai horns made out of biscuit!” “But isn’t it just another branch of The Ivy,” the editor says, “of which there are now at least 30?” “Well, yes, but also, no,” I reply, because no matter how hard you try, it really is difficult to refute how The Ivy has recently expanded and diluted its brand, from Krug down to buck’s fizz. The Ivy’s mothership in Covent Garden, once so headily glamorous and très exclusive, has spawned babies from Edinburgh to Bath, and now everyone can enjoy a sprinkle of the pixie dust one felt eating bang bang chicken next to Biggins back in 1991. The problem with The Ivy roll-out is that, without the celebs, the paparazzi scrums and the six-week wait for a table, these pleasant, dependable brasseries are not roaringly different from a Côte. But I’ll tell you what is different from a Côte? The Ivy Asia, with its Shrek-green, bubbling Vesuvius glass floor and bowls of Mongolian cheese (tastes exactly like paneer) in a light, jalfrezi-style sauce. This new-era Ivy is ostentatious, incongruous, showy and daft, but, overall, joy-making even as you sweep through the doors. As well as joy, I also felt gratitude that I wasn’t one of the hostesses freezing my lower portions off in a dusky-pink, bum-skimming, silk frock with bare legs and heels. You’re possibly by now wondering, “But Asia? What part of Asia? How can food simply be Asian? That’s 44,579,000 square kilometres of food traditions.” Are Korean pork bao with kimchi a thing? Is buttermilk fried chicken strictly “tempura” if it’s served in an avocado and jalapeño sauce? Did sashimi ever benefit from foam? Eating here requires the same mindset as when watching a Jason Statham film: thinking is not going to help. Just enjoy the spectacle. The Ivy Asia first showed its face in Spinningfields, Manchester. This new London venture has taken a prime tourist and corporate hotspot within walking distance of St Paul’s great dome, replacing Jamie Oliver’s Barbecoa, which closed because no one wanted lukewarm pork loin served belligerently. Or maybe it was because of Brexit. I snuck in on a Sunday, in one of my more vague disguises, when the place was at a third of its capacity and had more managers on the floor, managing other managers, than it had tables filled. The open kitchen had a legion of chefs. Even so, service was hysterically slow, although two and a half hours of waiting for a few dishes gave me time to get engrossed in a stand-off between middle management and upper middle management about the December rotas. Still, it’s early days, and the place will no doubt find its feet, because when food did arrive, it was fairly decent. We ate fresh, fatty tuna sashimi and smoky, barbecued mackerel nigiri, then plump yet delicate steamed prawn dumplings that came with a frankly unnecessary miso foam. Soft-shell crab bang bang salad had enough peanut, sesame and fresh crustacean to make it a star of the show. The crisp tofu bao bun with miso mayo was also rather good, but unpretty, because the honking tofu “cutlet” was too big for its bun. Restaurant reviewing has many Spinal Tap moments, and this bao made me feel a bit like Nigel Tufnel with his mini-bread disaster. Black cod was the right mix of sweet and umami, with soft, yielding, white flakes. Miso-marinated baby chicken was a rather unattractive, chopped-up, breadcrumbed schnitzel affair. Prices for the large dishes whisked us off to whopping bill land, coming in mostly at between £25 and £48 a pop. Pudding was worth the wait, though by this point I’d been there so long, my eyebrows needed threading. I had planned to have the tirayuzu, which is tiramisu made with pandan leaf and Roku gin, but then I saw the samurai going to other tables. This is £9.50-worth of Valrhona dark chocolate “soil” set on a dark chocolate mousse laden with chocolate brownie on vanilla ice-cream with chocolate pearls and biscuit horns sprayed gold. The whole thing forms a sort of samurai’s face that, after a few spoonfuls, looked more like Groundskeeper Willie off The Simpsons. Relax your brain; enjoy the glacial, emerald floor.

Theatreland in full yahoo merges with tottering hen parties, meandering mini-breakers, school trips, emergency response vehicles and bin trucks. You are either insane to open a classy, innovative, Persian restaurant here, serving ornate new spins on meze, grills and stovetop stuffs, or you are very, very clever. For passing footfall, Nutshell may seem slightly mysterious. Words like jojeh, borani and kubideh have yet to slip into regional UK parlance for chicken chunks, dip or minced meat. Frankly, Britain has as yet accepted the aubergine only very tepidly in all its bulbous, purple majesty. Yet here on the Nutshell menu, one will find it stewed with pearl onions and split chickpeas in a khoresht bademjan; or pulverised and strewn with feta, crisp shallot, blackcurrant and walnuts in a sublime take on baba ganoush. Similarly, walnut, which Brits admire mostly in a whip, is loud and proud in Nutshell’s panir sabzi, in the lamb meatballs, and diced roughly under the grilled cauliflower fesenjun. Of course, if you’re one of the UK’s 70,000 Iranian-born residents, you may think: “Nutshell, a new cool place! I’ll take my father as a treat!” knowing in your heart he’ll say: “I don’t want Caspian olive tapenade with rainbow radish. Why did Azerbaijan in Hammersmith shut? I want kalle-pache with the boiled sheep’s head looking at me! Now that was Persian food.” But Nutshell is definitely worth a gander, whichever way you come at it. Head chef Jeremy Borrow came from The Palomar, a place of clanking pots, a noisy kitchen squad and freeflowing labneh and fattoush. The Palomar is kind of half Ottolenghi/half 5am Portuguese squat rave – I mean that in a good way. Before that, Borrow spent 25 years cooking in Tel Aviv. And before that, he came from Carlisle, just like me, and has said he was raised, also like me, mainly on overcooked cabbage. There’s something about a 20th-century north-west English childhood that makes you run helter-skelter, arms wide into strange, delicious, foreign flavours. At Nutshell, Borrow’s skills mix with the dream project of Tehran-born Mohammad Paknejad and wife Marwa Alkhalaf, formerly chef at The Greenhouse. Nutshell is named after the Paknejad family’s pistachio orchards. Nutshell is not nightclubbish or semi-unruly like The Palomar; it is elegant, brightly lit and colourful, hewn from Persian patterns and a palette of greens and pinks. Most of the noise is from the kitchen brigade who “Yes, Chef” in unison from the lower-floor open kitchen. The menu is small; really, it’s merely a list. We started with freshly baked, delicious “bazaar bread”, which was a high point: a long, slender, salted loaf, to scoop through the very good Caspian olive tapenade and the soothing yoghurt-based mast-o khiar, prettily bejewelled with pomegranate and pistachio. An inky dish of beluga lentils with barberries flew under the radar. The smoky aubergine meze with feta is unmissable. We drank very good Bodega Cecchin Malbec at £7.50 a glass. I enjoyed the meze more than the main attractions: lamb chops, served pink as possible in a puddle of sour cherry jus, was quite muted flavourwise. A grilled half of baby cauliflower on a nutty puddle wasn’t anything really to shout about. It was all nevertheless prettily plated, and service throughout sweet and bright. The puddings, however, were a joy, especially the very elegant take on Persian zulbia: deep-fried swirls of batter, a sort of doughnutty, churros-like, carbohydrate-heavy safe space. These zulbia are neater and slightly drier than commonplace ones, but come with a bowl of incredible, fig-infused cream. It’s this heartstoppingly good, thigh-expandingly evil fig cream, plus the fresh bazaar bread, the olive tapenade and aubergine meze that would take me back to Nutshell. The Persian sundae is one of the capital’s prettiest puddings: zesty ice-cream, hints of basil, large black cherries with accompanying goo. It’s a pudding that sweeps me away, from my window vantage point in this corner of London’s West End, away from the staggering women in hen-party sashes, the crash of the emptying bottle banks and the arguing mini-breakers who mooch to the door of Nutshell, scan the menu and remember that he doesn’t like walnuts or aubergine and she doesn’t like rose water or cardamom. Let these people eat boiled cabbage. Pull up a chair; there’s a lot to love in here. • Nutshell, 30 St Martin’s Lane, London WC2, 020-3409 7926. Open all week, lunch 12pm–2.45pm, dinner 5pm–11pm.

Diners who might once have known curry simply as something that’s vivid red or fragrant brown and hails roughly from India now know a Malaysian laksa from a Thai massaman, or a katsu from a scotch bonnet-laden curry goat. Recently, more of us have been turned on to the joys of Sri Lanka. Kari and rich sambol served with a crisp, rice-and-coconut crepe, possibly with an egg baked into its base – an egg hopper – and smeared with sticky chutney. It’s a godly combination that, once tasted, you’ll wonder where it has been all your life. Patently, Sri Lankan food has been cooked lovingly in Wembley, Tooting and East Ham for decades, but it was the opening three years ago of the very much adored Hoppers in Soho that shoved Sri Lankan cuisine blinking into the “cool food” spotlight. I’m always curious how people feel when their cuisine is declared cool. I say this with some sympathy, as a Cumbrian woman who has spent 20 years shouting: “That is not Cumberland sausage!” at London menus. “It’s the wrong shape and it needs 10 times more black pepper.” Safe to say, however, that Kolamba’s owners Eroshan and Aushi Meewella’s reaction to Sri Lanka being “incredibly now, darling” has been to open this lovely new spot just off Regent Street, to showcase the food they remember from their childhood in Kolamba (that’s the Sinhalese name for Colombo, Sri Lanka’s capital). Colombo is home to people of Sinhalese, Tamil, Moor, Burgher and Malay descent. From the moment you walk through the door at Kolamba, it all feels very personal, as if the owners’ hearts are ablaze on their sleeves, eager to show the best of the street snacks, family dinners and teatime treats they remember from home. Each dish is a patchwork of people, places and things. A small plate of delicious fish cutlets from the “Bites” section of the menu are more akin to gefilte fish balls, formed from pilchards and potato, spiced and breadcrumbed. They’re a throwback from when the Dutch landed in Point Pedro and stayed for another 156 years. We eat sweet, flaky jackfruit patties and a small plate of Aunty Mo’s chatti roast – beef dry-fried with chilli, tomato and onion, served on buttery, string hoppers rice noodles. If we’d simply stayed with the snacks section and ordered multiple cutlets, it would have been equally joyous. Instead, we ranged across the curries, sambols and hoppers, ordering too much until the table heaved. A judiciously seasoned, sunset-yellow monkfish curry was followed by a bowl of parippu – red split lentils cooked in coconut and turmeric – that has made me rethink my entire lentil dal game. Why do my lentils never taste as rich and nuanced, yet soothing? How have I tried 876 dal recipes off the internet and still produce lacklustre stodge that pleases no one? Is this God’s way of making me book a fact-finding expedition to Colombo? We also ate our way through prawns fried in crushed black pepper and green chilli, and Kolamba’s hoppers, which are delicate, spongy and yielding in all the correct places. The diced tomato sambol with lime juice, green chilli and red onion is so very good, it would go with literally anything. Each time our server tried to make room on the table, we fought to keep hold of precious slicks of date and lime chutney, and ordered extra portions of the rather tough but useful pol roti coconut flatbread, which the menu describes as “rustic” and which does the job of reaching the puddles of runny egg yolk, coconut smears and cardamom-scented sauces that no fork or spoon can reach. After a Kolomba-colada – think piña colada made with vanilla-infused Ceylon arrack and cinnamon – we drank a bottle of Bastion De La Cité Rosé, not caring a damn for wine etiquette or the fact that I was dressed in a quilted jacket and snow boots. The pudding list is short, so we ate more hoppers, these ones drizzled in smoky kithul treacle. Kolamba is a small, independent, family-run Sri Lankan restaurant, within running and hiding distance of Oxford Street. They cook from scratch and want to teach you 100 new things about Sri Lanka, and they are offering big, bold lessons from a small, faraway island. You’d be daft not to take them up on it. • Kolamba 21 Kingly Street, London W1, 020-3815 4201. Open Tues-Fri, noon-3pm, 5.30-10.30pm; Sat &amp; Sun, noon-10.30pm.

The Small Holding in Kilndown, Kent, is one of these. It boasts the type of thriving, working kitchen garden with added pigs, geese and chickens for which addled city dwellers yearn. Chef Will Devlin opened the doors a mere 18 months ago, and already this former pub’s single acre heaves with courgettes, kale, fennel, peas, beans and approximately 200 other varieties of veg, fruit and herbs. It’s all very seductive to those of us who have been choking on car fumes, though the reality is that country life is for hardy folk who deal well with heartbreak. Your spuds may drown. Slugs will munch your fennel. No one will eat your Berkshire pig – in fact, it will become a cherished family member. This is why places such as The Small Holding are so wonderful. Pop in and get a load of its polytunnels. You can experience rural delight in small, no-risk snapshots, and in mouthfuls of meadowsweet-flavoured cream, gaspingly fresh bowls of homegrown tomatoes with basil, and in plates strewn with vibrant nasturtium flowers picked that morning. Come for the edible thistles and wild strawberries, stay for the freshly dug radishes, washed and served with a herb mayo. We went to The Small Holding for Saturday lunch a couple of days before Devlin was revealed as the 2020 “chef to watch” by The Waitrose Good Food Guide. The title is completely justified, even if it does sound like an ominous curse. Devlin and gang were clearly relishing life pre-scrutiny, before the hordes of farm-to-table bores turn up wearing their reclaimed potato-peeling gilets, and before anyone calls up for the coordinates so they can land their helicopter, and is then outraged that somewhere 20 minutes from Tunbridge Wells, staffed by family and friends, is not as slickly run as Noma, which has a cast of hundreds. The Small Holding is, however, already up there with another brilliant example of self-sustaining, fun fine-dining: Gareth Ward’s Ynyshir in Powys, Wales. This is skilful cooking that retains joy, pace and mischief throughout. The “Full Acre” 11-course menu is £60 (with a wine pairing starting at £40). With fancy dining, the rule of thumb is that the briefer the menu descriptions, the longer the incarceration. Not here. No, sir. “Sweetcorn, egg, mushroom” is followed swiftly by “courgette, chilli, coriander”, and with cheery service, too. A soft, sous-vide yolk appears dotted with crisp kernels and small, earthy bites of fungus. Then, in prompt succession, courgette comes conjured up into a sort-of turbo-bhaji. This is a magical mouthful, my highpoint of lunch. “Those courgettes are from over there,” our server says perkily, pointing out past the car park. It’s all so refreshingly normal. They push Squerryes’ English sparkling, rather than champagne. Locals turn up sporadically for a pint in the beer garden. You could probably take your gran, although she might balk slightly at the sweet, crimson-coloured fennel and plum choux bun. I’m not sure what she’d make of the raspberry course with tarragon and a sort-of-rösti potato topping, either, but the whole thing hangs together rather beautifully. Our menu (which I expect will have altered by the time you read this) featured a fabulous play on old-school Cumberland pie and peas – mutton with small, heavenly, bright green peas straight from the pod. “This tastes exactly like the pie and peas we used to eat in Cumbria after dance classes when I was about seven,” I wittered on to Charles. “Cooked by my gran, who always made her pie in a plate. Her kitchen always smelled of gas. Do you know what I mean?” Which, of course, he didn’t. Because that’s what the best sort of fine dining does: it shines light into corners of your brain that you’ve not used for decades. Flavours you thought were no longer possible, only to find out they are; you simply weren’t eating the correct item at its exact freshest or in the right combination. There’s still a real sense of the thoroughly unpretentious, 90s-style country pub about The Small Holding, despite it being prettified with designer paints and fancy hand soaps. Please go and watch Will Devlin and his team, but preserve and conserve their normal-ness. They’re just a group of folk growing amazing things, then pulling them out of the ground, sometimes knobbly and lumpy, then cooking and serving them. It’s perfectly imperfect, and I wouldn’t change a thing. • The Small Holding Ranters Lane, Kilndown, near Cranbrook, Kent, 01892 890105. Open lunch Weds-Sun, noon-2.30pm, dinner Weds-Sat, 6-9pm.

All dishes £4.50-£9; wine £12.95 Night has come to Glasgow and with it an insistent, drenching rain of a sort often gifted by the Atlantic to Scotland’s west coast when autumn comes. The outer panels of the Hydro arena down by the Clyde are glowing in candy shades of pink and sky blue, as if it’s ready to return to the planet that dispatched it, and on Queen Street the gutters are overflowing. Most restaurateurs would despair at weather like this. Presumably the owners of Mikaku, a self-styled izakaya, or Japanese-inspired inn, are not among them. It all just adds to the vibe. One of those owners described it to the website Glasgow Live when they opened last spring as a “neo-Tokyo dystopian style” and we’ll have to take their word for it. It’s gilded in neon. The floor is a faux cobbled lane, complete with manholes. It’s edged with communal tables under lean-to roofs and food outlets with their own counters, as if it’s a street food alley. Corrugated iron sheeting has been pressed into service. There are two ways to go here. You can engage in a bout of championship eye-rolling, while muttering about theme-park dining and trying too hard, that might make you feel superior; or you can acknowledge that most restaurant design is a version of this: an attempt to create a space that separates you from the world outside. For what it’s worth, I’ve eaten my way around the tightly knotted streets of inns and cafés in Tokyo’s Shinjuku district and Mikaku would fit in there. The Japanese adore a bit of overblown, comic-book kitsch. They’d get it. So why shouldn’t we? Likewise, I think they’d get the food. While there are izakayas that have raised the cooking far beyond what was originally expected of them, at base they are meant to provide something to soak up the booze: the endless chilled glasses of Asahi and Sapporo, the cocktails with names like Electric Lychee and Ginger Zen. Or in our case the serviceable sauvignon blanc at £12.95 a bottle. That wasn’t me being a cheap. They only have one choice of red, white or rosé. All of them are £12.95. We drag warm, salt-sprinkled edamame pods through our teeth to get at the beans inside, and try to focus on the graphic violence of the place-mat menu. I could now niggle about certain details and I will, because it’s part of my job description. I have to raise an eyebrow over the thickness of the noodles in their ramen and wonder whether they are the exact alkaline variety they should be. I must point out that the tonkotsu stock, which should have the lip-smack of gelatine from pork bits simmered for half a day until the bones have given their all, is a little on the insubstantial side. But the impact of the cooking here is cumulative and is so much more than the sum of those parts. The site was previously a ramen shop, run by the same people, before they extended the menu and became this. Pleasingly, they offer half portions at £4.50; Lilliputian miniatures in small bowls that allow you to go face down in them without filling up to the exclusion of the rest of the offering. The slices of chashu belly pork in the tonkotsu ramen are soft and sweet and salty, with just the right balance of fat to meat. In a miso black ramen, with burnt garlic oil and more slices of garlic cooked until crisp, there are pearly pieces of chicken breast. The rest of it – the sliced spring onions, the leaves of nori, the sprinkle of sesame seeds – is all very much here. We have a large portion of their chicken karaage for £6.50 because, like any sane, properly brought up, interesting person, I am powerless in the face of thigh first dumped in a soy-based marinade then given a dusting of seasoned cornflour and finally deep fried. It is that ludicrously compelling combination of crispy and salty; of soft, tenderised meat steamed in its shell, and crumbly bits that mustn’t be allowed to escape. There’s a dollop of sweetened chilli sauce on the side and some mayo. It’s a subtle, understated dish in the way that Rylan Clark-Neal’s teeth are subtle. But the rain is still coming down, and the wine is still flowing, which means this fried chicken is necessary. There is an attempt at self-care courtesy of a well-made wakame salad of slippery ribbons of seaweed, with just the right bite, in a soy and sesame dressing. Then it’s on to the chicken wings, presented unjointed, with the awkward geometry of pointed tip to drummer. They are tricky and messy to eat like this, but the staff are watching. They chuck wet wipes on to the table as if they are life preservers thrown to the drowning. The sweet soy and sesame versions with their crisp shell are worth the mess and very much worth the price at £2.90 for two. I also order a pair of the hot variety in “Oni Demon” sauce. The cheery Glaswegian waitress looks at me kindly and says, “Are you sure, hen?” I wave her away with the casualness of a man who has seen many things and will see many more. It turns out I haven’t seen this. They are red and they are angry and they make my diaphragm go into spasm and sweat pool under my eyes. Coming to Mikaku has been a good idea. Ordering these has not been a good idea. I manage one. She takes away the other, with the nod of a woman who knew it would come to this. Grilled skewers of pork, beef and chicken with spring onion, at around £2 each, are smoky and seared in all the right places. We’ve avoided the gyoza, because they’d told me they bought them in rather than made them here. However, the dessert menu includes fried apple gyoza with butterscotch sauce, and they cannot be resisted: they’re a tiny version of an apple Pop-Tart. I mean that in a good way. They’re certainly better than the weird peanut-butter ice cream. No matter. There’s enough left in the bottle to deaden the taste. We pay the modest bill, bow our heads in thanks to Mikaku for showing us a good time, and head out through the ostentatious weather to nearby Hope Street, and a blues jam at the club Swing. After all the damn piano isn’t going to play itself. Jay’s news bites Koj, the cheery Cheltenham restaurant from MasterChef finalist Andrew Kojima, does not claim to be an izakaya, but it does boast a “beer food menu”, which pretty much makes it one. There’s a list of buns, filled with the likes of pork belly, apple and kimchi or panko cauliflower with curry mayo, as well as udon noodles, donburi rice bowls, various ramen and the obligatory fried chicken (kojcheltenham.co.uk). There was scepticism when McDonald’s announced it would be available for delivery through the likes of Uber Eats. Who would bother to get something as cheap as McDonald’s delivered? A lot of people, it seems. Delivery is now available at 950 of its sites and, according to the company, accounts for more than 10% of all their business in the UK. On 18 September McDonald’s says it received a record 124,000 delivery orders. Major churn in the London restaurant world.

This boozer, a few miles from Bristol city centre, had been mentioned to me by food-lovers several times, and the words “traditional” and “proper” featured regularly, as did “dependably brilliant Sunday lunch”. We all need one of those up our sleeve: there’s not a problem in the world that roast potatoes and gravy do not improve. Aside from, perhaps, gout, though by that stage you may as well crack on. The Kenny, as it’s affectionately called, is one of the latest projects of chef Josh Eggleton, whom I met across a judging table on BBC2’s Great British Menu. It was the series celebrating “great Britons”, where chefs queued up to cure trout in tribute to their forefathers and present puddings symbolising the Windrush. Eggleton, I learned here, is the face behind the Michelin-starred country pub The Pony &amp; Trap in Chew Magna, and was a curiously humble culinary genius, as well as a restaurant entrepreneur who has opened a number of chip shops and bistros around the Bristol area. Still, during TV competitions, in which chefs are pushed to be showy, thematic or to “cook outside their comfort zone”, I often long to taste the type of food they think is delicious when they’re not being asked to make great telly. Nobody on MasterChef: The Professionals ever says, “Today, I’ve cooked a leek and jersey royal potato soup, and served it with fresh sourdough and good salted butter”, but by God, sometimes I wish they would. A woman can endure only so many offal bonbons with a Pernod clafoutis chaser. Joyously, at The Kenny, with Luke Hawkins (ex Pony &amp; Trap) at the helm, the single-sheet Sunday lunch menu begins with precisely this straightforward leek-and-spud pottage. It is velvety, fragrant and balm-like. It reminds me of the folly of how, in recent decades, Brits have been made to feel sheepish over recent decades about choosing soup as a starter, as if it’s only one step up from that other classic 1970s opening act, “a glass of pasteurised orange juice”. The Kenny has the soup to change all of that. Other starters included a crab cake with curried mayo and pickled kohlrabi, while some crisp brawn came armed with both pickles and piccalilli. Brawn, or head cheese, is made from the rich, flavourful, gelatinous meat from a pig’s head, which all chefs swear is the best bit. It may not be to be everyone’s taste, but if you’ve ever eaten a cheap sausage, I’m fairly certain you’ve consumed much worse. We were delighted with a bowl of good, fresh, perfectly judged Cornish mussels in a rich, piquant, cider-and-cream broth, which Charles chose and which I pilfered with a long spoon. The Kenny, I felt after my first white peach bellini, is the type of pub that gives you a crisis of conscience about flagging it up to the outside world. The locals are so happy right now in this space, which is far from gargantuan, and its welcoming, open-kitchened back room that’s peppered with peculiar, culinary-themed art and staffed by people who are far, far more brilliant than they need to be for a pub, as if this were the Mirabelle in the late 1990s. The Kenny is cleanly kept with non-sticky tables, spotless loos and comfy banquettes that have not as yet been spattered with gravy. It has everything a boozer should have, aside from, perhaps, a saggy-faced pub dog ambling about and begging crisps. We drank Dashwood Pinot Gris from New Zealand at £7 a glass and waited for what is known on the menu as “The Main Event”. Charles had medium-rare dry-aged Hereford beef rump – thick, pinky-red slices, with fluffy, light yorkshire pudding, crisp, plump, roast potatoes, red cabbage and one of those carrots that are so fancy, they give you only one. I found my own nirvana in a heavenly sweet potato and chestnut wellington: soft, sweet, nutty and perfectly seasoned, with glorious pastry. I have tasted some beastly vegetarian wellingtons in my time, but this one restored my faith. In fact, supermarkets putting together their Christmas food offerings could learn from The Kenny, and save veggie food lovers from another Yule eating what tastes like budgie feed wrapped in the Dead Sea scrolls. For pudding, we shared a highly memorable frangipane tart, a deconstructed bakewell of sorts, with tonka bean ice-cream, which I always think of as a sort of wicked, next-level vanilla. I left The Kenny full to the brim of deliciousness and walking like a pregnant penguin.

Skirting with modern parlance is an ugly game for anyone aged over 20, but still, of a Sunday lunchtime in this heaving, pretend-Parisian dining room in St John’s Wood, it’s all I can think about. Soutine fills the space of a former Carluccio’s, and it’s almost as affordable. A croque madame with frites is just over 13 quid, or roughly the same price as one at Café Rouge, but there the similarities end. At Soutine, taut-faced ladies share plates of confit de canard with tiny lapdogs, while well-upholstered octogenarian blokes wearing billowing chinos drown out the world with a second bottle of Mercurey Vieilles Vignes; the waiting staff pirouette between the back and front dining rooms, family parties squabble, happy birthday is sung in many different tongues. The menu’s in French-sounding English, while, judging from the decor, we’re on the southern bank of the Seine, maybe in Montparnasse, in about 1928. Restaurateurs Chris Corbin and Jeremy King, the owners of Soutine, among many others, are the archdukes of ambience, creating a genre of noisy tableaux vivants, rather than straightforward dining spots. People don’t flock to The Wolseley for life-changing eggs on toast; they go for a big plate of mood. With all this in mind, it’s worth noting that late last month Corbin and King recently admitted defeat with their north London restaurant Bellanger, stating that they couldn’t quite make the numbers work. And industry titans of their calibre saying they can’t get enough bums on seats in central Islington is a bit like Tower of London beefeaters saying, “Guys, we’ve not seen the ravens for a few weeks, but let’s not fret.” Still, as of now, St John’s Wood is not short of the louche, the elegant-but-indolent and the deadline-avoidant to keep Soutine afloat. For the non-Londoner, the area is that fragrant hinterland between Regent’s Park and Kilburn. If one was being chased roughly south-west by an escaped London Zoo lion, one could be in Soutine, under a table and drinking muscat, within about 12 minutes. “Do you mind my little dog?” asks a Swiss gentleman at the table beside me while hoisting up a panting, lap-bound bundle that, predictably, resembles something a child would use to store pyjamas. “Not at all,” I say, because I love dogs more than almost all people. In fact, my ideal pub would be that one in the painting with all the dogs playing snooker. Charles orders a plate of inky wild mushrooms on soft, buttery brioche as a pre-starter starter, because he’s ravenous, and French – ergo, pleases himself. I faff for much longer, transfixed by the Little Venice locals. One man chips away at a whole globe artichoke, steered off steak frites by his worrying wife. Youngsters show up for Sunday lunch with strained smiles and one eye on their inheritance. We order a large, crisp endive salad strewn with dandelion leaves and laced with a citrus dressing, plus a plate of thinly sliced, oak-smoked salmon served with finely diced shallots and good, punchy capers. Soutine isn’t using the very, very best ingredients, but it is using what they can be proud of while still keeping the lights on. The coq au riesling is a great bet here if one needs comfort food: it’s a silky, decadent pot of cream, booze et poulet. Eat it with a bowl of Soutine’s petit pois à la française, one of my very favourite things, where sweet peas meet parsley, garlic and onion. Charles also clears a nicely judged piece of lemon sole with muscat grapes and a vermouth sauce. For vegetarians, there is a special plats principaux menu featuring spinach pelmeni, spiced vegetable haché and beetroot terrine with horseradish. By the time we get to pudding, we start off squabbling over its necessity, and end up with three: a salted caramel eclair, a bowl of mousse aux deux chocolats – both passable – and, best of all, a tarte fine aux pommes with a large scoop of vanilla ice-cream. Recently, I have learned to stop kvetching and love TripAdvisor, having come round to the fact that I like reading what people dislike about fun restaurants. One “reviewer” complains that the tarte fine at Soutine is too “fine”, the pastry too delicate and, worse still, it comes swimming in ice-cream. Someone else moans that there’s no phone reception in the back room, and don’t they know she’s a very important businesswoman. She might miss a call. Others whinge that they walked in with no booking and the place was far too busy to seat them instantly. The way things are going in the restaurant world right now, I’ll excuse Soutine for not viewing this as a problem.

Starters £6.95-£9.95, mains £14.95-£29.95, desserts £4.95-£6.95, three-course lunch £22, wines from £22 The good ones have a soundtrack all of their own; a gentle hum of easy, contented chatter, with the occasional clink of cutlery on plate and bottle to glass keeping time. The Leaping Hare at Wyken Vineyards, not far from Bury St Edmunds, is one of the good ones. Outside, on a calm autumn day, a few diners sit at tables, soaking up what feels like the last breath of the year’s warm sunshine, tucked in against the high, foliage-clad walls of the old barn. A herd of sheep and what appear to be a couple of llamas – I’ve never been that great on my camelids – keep the grass short beyond the fence. The air smells sweetly of leaf mulch on the turn. Inside, a certain kind of England is being fed, and being fed exceptionally well; it is that part of England, to be fair, which would think it has little interest in this newspaper. And yet, here I am, on the site of one of the country’s oldest vineyards, about to have a very lovely time. The late Beryl Cook would have recognised some of the ladies here from her own paintings, their glasses perched just on the bridge of the nose, as they give themselves to a good lunch. The men too, for that matter. It is a place for people-watching. This older crowd, a lot of them now untroubled by the call of daily work, has nowhere better to be than here, inside this vaulting space, the walls traced by gnarled beams only just about managing a straight line. The art is tasteful. The paintwork, in muted tones, is tasteful. There is a cleaned, blue-black mussel shell staring at us from the bowl of snowy sea salt, the better to scoop it up. It’s that kind of tasteful. Come friends, and slip gently with me into the restaurant equivalent of the bubble bath you never quite want to leave. I am late to this party, by about a quarter of a century. The Leaping Hare has been in the Good Food Guide for 25 years, and has held a Bib Gourmand, the most interesting award from the tyre company, representing good food at a reasonable price, for more than 20 years. There are hints on the menu of an awareness of the times and their passing. The word “foraged” appears. There are asterisks to indicate that certain dishes are made with ingredients from the estate or from within five miles of it; on others, that the key ingredients are from Norfolk or Suffolk. The whole “diving into hedgerows to find wild things that taste much like farmed things” has never quite excited me; as I’ve said before and I’ll keep saying, if foraging were so great, presumably we would want everyone to be doing it. If that happened, the eco-system would collapse. Farming was a great invention. What’s more, it’s all irrelevant if what happens to those ingredients when they reach the kitchen misses the mark. Here, it doesn’t. The cooking at the Leaping Hare isn’t innovative. It’s British produce, given a proper seeing to with lots of classic French bourgeois technique and an emphasis on big, crowd-pleasing flavours. You may not coo over the first mouthful. Instead, gently, as the meal goes on, you will clock just how well you are being cared for. A partridge breast is seared and roasted, but there is still a crimson blush within. There’s more partridge broken into the rich stew of white beans and lardons upon which it sits. A scoop of golden fried breadcrumbs, flecked with the green of herbs, is spread across the top to give it a texture. It’s a lot of starter for £7.95. That understanding of the need for crunch is obvious in a second starter of spiced and roasted monkfish, with golden onion rings, looking like something you could wear as a dainty bangle, speared by crisp batons of green apple. It comes on what is described simply as “curry sauce”. It is the deep yellow of the best butter. It is sweet. It is only very lightly spiced. It’s the perfect sauce for a coronation chicken, and lubricates the fish perfectly. It makes me laugh out loud. It’s like meeting an old friend unexpectedly, after a long time separated. Venison, served rare enough for you to imagine you could test the blood type, comes with roasted shallots, savoy cabbage and their version of clapshot – mash mixed through with parsnip – and a rich game jus that’s so shiny you could see your face in it. There are onion rings, again, for that bit of texture. They are tiny this time, as if designed for your pinkie rather than your wrist. It’s also a menu that recognises the value of letting a dish give up its own secrets. Duck breast has been rendered so that there is only a thin layer of fat beneath the bronzed skin. Here are damsons from the estate, and whorls of a smooth, duck liver parfait and a few crushed hazelnuts. Here, too, is the advertised dauphinoise, served as a crisped rectangle. We are pleased to see it. But hang on, what’s this in the middle? The two slabs of potato are sandwiching long-cooked then shredded duck, as if it were some savoury bourbon biscuit. It feels like you’ve been lobbed a freebie. Yours for £19.95. Their dark chocolate sorbet is good; the lip-puckering passion fruit flavour is better. Best of all is a pavlova, the meringue part fashioned through some sort of kitchen witchcraft into a cup, filled with damsons and damson ice-cream and sugared nuts for crunch. It disappears quickly. Service is of the smooth, unobtrusive kind that recognises that people eating here probably want to talk to each other, more than they wish to hear long speeches. There is a bustling café down at the other end of the room, knocking out fishcakes, pasta dishes and bowls of mussels. They don’t miss a beat, in either space. This, of course, is a vineyard. It is only right that we drink some of what might be called their rosé, were it not the deep pink of pear drops. It is luscious, a last taste of the summer just gone. We pay up and wander into the “country store” out the back, selling picture frames and children’s books, salad servers and vases and all manner of things you didn’t think you needed until you saw them. Outside the breeze blows, the leaves fall and all is very much right with the world. News bites My strongest memory of Maison Bleue in Bury St Edmunds, from my visit a few years back, is of a lady in a hat, eating oysters off the half shell by herself. It was all very civilised. If anything, the offering has stepped up a notch since then. Go for the likes of crab with apple, caviar and lemon grass, or rabbit with kohlrabi and oyster ice cream, followed by halibut with a cauliflower crust and a cockle emulsion (maisonbleue.co.uk). Despite the collapse of the Jamie’s Italian chain earlier this year, Jamie Oliver is pushing ahead with his mid-market restaurant interests, only outside the UK. He is to launch Jamie Oliver’s Kitchen, an all-day concept, in Bali and Bangkok. According to the company the menu could be ‘easily adapted to local flavours and food trends’. In Bangkok, for example, this will include a soft shell crab burger with green papaya salad. A simple marker of the economic challenges faced by the UK’s hospitality industry: according to research by accountants UHY Hacker Young, the country’s top 100 restaurants recorded a combined loss of £93 million in the past year. In the previous 12 months it was a £37m profit.

But then one idea trumps all. “OK, it’s a food court. But a very posh, expensive one. You still queue, order, ship your own drinks and sit open-plan, but it’s £14 for a small ham sandwich. The credit card machine asks you for a tip immediately before every transaction.” Too far, one may think. But no, the Arcade Food Theatre has arrived, boasting a name like a My Bloody Valentine spin-off project and a London location so central it’s literally underneath Centrepoint, within footfall of the hungry hordes who ransack Oxford Street Primark. It should not be a difficult place to sell food. The nearby branch of Chopstix is serving boxed noodles and hot spring rolls (15 for £2.50), hand over fist, from 10am-10pm every day. Yet most things are difficult in this food court – apologies, this “collection of independent kitchens and incubation-focused mezzanine space showcasing emerging culinary concepts”. The lineup is beyond doubt impressive, with the likes of delightful, growingly cultish bakery Pophams and Casita do Frango, who do posh piri piri chicken incredibly well in Borough. Oklava, Lina Stores and Pastorcito all have incredible pedigrees, bringing their Turkish, Italian and Mexican specialities to the mix. Arcade Food Theatre is a billion miles removed from loading a tray with Spud-U-Like and Taco Bell at Manchester Arndale Centre Food Court, or eating a streetfood burger at a picnic table under a railway arch. This place is luxuriously built and exhaustingly modern, like a “funky”, “hip” hotel one books for a European minibreak, which, within minutes, makes you weep for the dependable functionality of a Premier Inn. The concept, as far as I see it – and it’s heavily open for debate – is that one orders food at the individual counters, and they make it from scratch, in anywhere between 10 to 30 minutes. There is seating near the counters. No signage anywhere informs the newbie where or how one should sit, pay, or collect food. There is nothing as gauche or functional as a buzzer to inform you the food is ready. There are no drinks available at many of the food stands. One is required to queue again at the cocktail bar area, where a small glass of Coca-Cola is £2.50 plus an immediate hustle for a tip. Arcade Food Theatre does not do takeaway. In an age when Deliveroo is king and restaurants are bending over backwards to ship food out to offices and commuters in any way possible, they do not have boxes and look genuinely shocked you’d want one. “We cannot maintain the standard,” I’m told at Tou, the upstairs “incubation kitchen”, which according to the internet opens at 8am, but when I went for breakfast on a Saturday at 11am, I was told they open, maybe, at 1pm. I gave up on food that time and went straight to the bar for a pretty good bloody mary. Tou specialises in the “sando”, which is a Japanese word for “we are sticking a deep-fried breaded pork cutlet between two slices of brioche while playing Mr Wendell by Arrested Development semi-ironically – give me £14 plus tip”. On my second jaunt to Arcade Food Theatre, I whipped through around £33 in about half an hour. London’s best almond croissant, from Pophams, costs £3.80 and a latte another £3. At Oklava, I chose a freshly baked, cheese and butter, Black Sea pide, which makes Turkish people sigh when it is compared to pizza, but alas, it’s hard to avoid. At about six inches, with egg yolk, black garlic and za’atar, it was delightful, definitely decadent and punchily priced at £12. Returning to Tou, I chose the tofu sando: chopped boiled egg laced with wasabi mayonnaise, spring onion and fresh coriander with two pockets of breaded, deep-fried silken tofu between brioche-like Japanese milk bread, for £10.50. This feisty blend is clearly someone, somewhere’s idea of a delicious sandwich, and I thoroughly respect that. This sando has graced dozens of Instagram feeds, where diners who were given it for free at the opening parties said they had an amazing, thoroughly seamless experience at this brilliant, clever new food-hall concept and that this was the greatest sandwich ever. Frankly, I don’t believe them. Food: 5/10 Service: 0/10 Ambience: 0/10 Arcade Food Theatre, 103-105 New Oxford Street, London, WC1A, 020-7519 1202. arcade-london.com.

Small plates £5-£16. Large plates £19-£36. Desserts £7-£8. Wines from £27 Dinner at the Soak, inside the Grosvenor Hotel in London’s Victoria, is like a game of battleships. You have no idea whether the dish you’ve ordered is going to be on target or far out in the deep, storm-lashed sea. You can eat well here, in a way which will make you coo and purr. Or the meal can leave you with aching eyeballs from all the rolling. Inconsistent doesn’t quite cover it. At times it feels as if there are two kitchens back there. Cross your fingers and hope you get food prepared by the good one. That inconsistency extends to the service. When eating there everything is as it should be: attentive in all the right places, but good at disappearing when it’s clear we’re fine as we are. The problem lies with gaining entry to that room. With online booking you trade the intimacy of a conversation with a human being, for immediacy, precision and convenience. Here, when I attempt to book a table, the computer tells me that I don’t have a booking yet; that they’ll confirm within 48 hours. WTF? I want to know now. Actually, I need to know now. Because if you aren’t going to give me a table, I’ll need to book somewhere else. I don’t have two days to spare waiting to find out. The website tells me that if I need to speak to someone urgently, I should email. Eh? I already have that relationship with my bank; I don’t want it with a restaurant. I try phoning the number on the site. Across 24 hours I try five times, and only ever get an answer machine. Eventually, 28 hours after my first enquiry, I’m told I have my table. Charmed, I’m sure. Of course, when I get there, the huge, ballroom-like space is close to empty. Happening beats which I really wish were not happening at all ricochet off the high ceilings. There are banquettes along the walls and blocks of curving booths down the middle of the room, overhung by the kind of globe lights that are used to illuminate the pathways to student halls of residence. All of it looks like it could be de-installed and shoved in the back of a truck within 90 minutes if the hotel management finally decides none of this was a good idea. There are moments when I wish they would reach this conclusion soon. The Soak gets its name from an on-trend interest in pickling, fermenting, brining and the like. At first, when they deliver us a plate of sweet-salty pickled cherry tomatoes, silverskin onions, cauliflower florets and candy-pink sliced radishes I am optimistic. They are crunchy and thrilling without being wince-inducing. It feels like a declaration of intent. The problem is that the kitchen, led by former Tom Aikens chef Chris Zachwieja, doesn’t quite follow through on those pickles. From here on in, everything is understated. Still, there really are some great dishes and let’s for the moment pretend we were served just those. From the list headed “Jars, cured &amp; pickled” comes a dice of cured venison with a pleasing bite and intensity as if it got halfway to jerky and changed its mind. There are splodges of cured egg yolk and, across the top, a few peppery nasturtium petals. From the same list, lamb belly fritters with a black garlic mayo are a huge hit of meaty lanolin. Some on my table find them completely overwhelming. They point out that this kind of high flavour is why we started serving lamb with mint sauce. I find them irresistible and finish off everybody else’s. From a list headed “Plants &amp; garden” there is a silky cauliflower soup, bobbing with gnocchi flavoured with Comté cheese, and a dish of smoked kohlrabi laid on a bold pea-green risotto of spelt. From the large plates there is a meaty roasted wood pigeon, served pink, in a deep glossy jus with ribbons of fermented mooli. It doesn’t need the bullying pickled anchovies. Very few things do. We finish with a bright, sharp lemon tart with buttery biscuit base – I know what I did there – and a masterful dark chocolate and honeycomb baked Alaska which deserves and gets all our attention. And with that we went home and everything was lovely. Except it wasn’t, was it? So, let’s go right back to the beginning. A salad of cider-pickled eggs with hazelnuts and chicory is a grim reminder of 1970s pub food when a boiled egg salad was considered classy. The pickling of the eggs, the only thing which might have made it interesting, is meagre and insipid. Hot and sour pickled prawns with a lime and carrot salad reads beautifully. That’s the only thing it does. It is a dull plate of crunchy, rubbery things. If you’re going to use words like hot and sour, they’d better be. They aren’t. A plate of tomatoes with basil fregola looks exactly like the spelt dish, but is floppy and underseasoned. The “aubergine tempura” pieces on top deserve to be inside quotation marks. They are an insult to deep frying. They haven’t so much been battered as incarcerated, and leak oil as we bite in. A flavourless fillet of cured trout has a crisped skin, but nothing further to recommend it. Everything else on the plate – the ribbons of fennel, the torched cucumber, the gob of spittle-foam dribbled hither and yon – is equally bland and uninspiring. It feels like the cook responsible for the pigeon dish popped outside for a fag while this one was being knocked up. Finally, there is a failed rhubarb soufflé. It looks like a cupcake tucked away in a ramekin for its own safety. (I’m now posting the pictures I took during my meal as a memory jogger, over on Instagram under @jayrayner1, if you fancy taking a look). Amazingly, it manages to be slightly better than what they call a rum baba: a dense, collapsed, swamp of substandard sponge in a puddle of vaguely coconut-flavoured water, like something that has wept from a wound. Lumps of roasted pineapple loiter like witnesses at a crime scene. I find it extraordinary that the same kitchen which produced the glorious baked Alaska, with its glazed peaks and chocolate hit, could also be responsible for one of the worst desserts I have ever been served. For the money spent, which is significant, the whole experience is deeply unsatisfactory. But it’s also something else: it’s just seriously, inexplicably weird. And that is what sums up the Soak. News bites Another place with a developed interest in curing, pickling and fermenting is Träkol, the restaurant of the By The River Brew Co, on the Gateshead side of the Tyne. Try cured North Sea trout with fried curry leaf and yogurt, the soy pickled egg with cream cheese and togarashi and, best of all, the middle white pig feasting plate, including half a roasted head plus a 1kg chop, yours for £50 (bytheriverbrew.co). Research released by caterer.com has found that 97% of school pupils and those leaving education have “written off” the idea of working in the hospitality industry. That may be wise. Another study by the Royal Society for Public Health found that 62% of hospitality workers don’t feel looked after by their employers; 74% have suffered verbal abuse and 24% have required medical or psychological help. In brighter news, New City College in London’s Hackney is opening a café and restaurant on its campus, specifically designed to give catering students hands-on experience of the industry. OKN1, short for open kitchen and its postcode, starts trading this month and will serve a ‘modern European’ menu.

Seafood prices vary depending upon choices and weight, but roughly £10-£25 This week’s restaurant is not a secret. Many of Manchester’s Chinese restaurateurs will know exactly where it is: on a scuffed drag, a mile or so east of Manchester Piccadilly station, overlooking wasteground apparently untouched by thoughts of urban regeneration. That doesn’t stop Live Seafood being obscure. And utterly, delightfully nuts. It was once a red brick boozer called the Seven Stars, but now has an extension and a lot of signage, plastered with giant images of lobsters, king crabs and shiny fish. Occasionally the building is hung with fairy lights. They love a fairy light at Live Seafood. Inside, through the doorway to your right, there are a couple of large, round tables, with lazy Susans. Depending on the time of day there may be more fairy lights. Beyond that are the tanks, bubbling furiously, courtesy of the filtration systems. This is both a retail and a catering operation, Hong Kong style. Here are live turbot, eel and carp. Here are velvet crabs and brown crabs, and in one tank, a king crab the span of a car tyre, which could have your eye out. There are also ludicrously penile geoduck, the single entendre of the seafood world. Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to meet your dinner. Some will find this whole thing repulsive; they will literally be repulsed by the notion that they should select the living creature they are about to consume. To which I say: get over yourselves. The vegans and vegetarians have a robust and consistent position on this; the others, the ones who are happy to eat seafood as long as they don’t have to witness a wiggling claw before they do so, not so much. It’s very simple. Here, the moment of death has been moved significantly closer to your plate. There is an extensive laminated menu, which leans towards the Sichuan end of things. There are garish pictures of a plate piled with stir-fried pig intestines with dried chilli and Sichuan pepper. It looks like a big heap of glowering red things. There’s gong bao chicken and lamb with cumin. But given the presence of those tanks, choosing the meat dishes would be an odd way to go. Just be aware that most of the seafood listings in that menu come with an ominous “market price” tag. You must be prepared to walk the tanks and discuss what you want with the staff, as if you know what the hell you are doing. I’m not sure why you’d come here, otherwise. Just make sure to ask for the prices, so there are no nasty surprises. Most full servings will work out at somewhere between £15 and £25, but that whole king crab, for example, turns out to be £200. “We don’t charge for cooking,” the nice lady says, by way of encouragement. We decline. Get it right, though, and a meal here won’t be some mere novelty, a cracking anecdote with which to entertain your mates. It will be a parade of the best and (obviously) freshest Chinese seafood dishes you will ever have had placed before you. We do not specifically choose which specimens we wish to eat, though I’m sure you could do that. Instead we point at each tank in turn, ask how we can have the contents prepared and the staff give us the options. It’s a serious business. As well as the tables downstairs they have four private rooms upstairs, each holding one huge table. Apparently, delegations of Chinese business people fresh off flights from Shanghai pile into these rooms all the time. We are offered one. The wall is cheerily decorated with images from Finding Nemo: you’ve seen the movie, now eat the cast, and so on. Tsingtao beers are brought and, while we are left to wait, I spin the lazy Susan, because that’s always fun and I often wish I was still seven years old. And then it begins. First to arrive are a couple of cracked velvet crabs, served salt and pepper-style, the edges lightly battered, with handfuls of fresh chilli, garlic and spring onion. I know immediately this will be a “jug of water by the bed” meal, but I also know it’s going to be worth it. We have crackers, but these crabs have thin, friable shells that we can get through with our teeth. It’s followed by a heaped platter of clams, with black bean sauce. I roll up my sleeves and reach for a pile of napkins, because it’s a hands-on job and there is no way to do this cleanly, if you do it properly. It’s the meaty equivalent of eating pistachios: there is the meditative process of lifting the shell. You probe with your tongue for the good stuff and discard the empties. We have a large platter of prawns that have been deep-fried in their shells. You may peel them if you wish. I like the texture of those salty shells, crisped up in the hot oil. There is a little sweet chilli sauce to send them on their way and, for no obvious reason, save that fairy lights make everything better, a single bulb tied to the plate by a strand of clingfilm. It flashes blue and pink. The star of the show is a whole head-and-tail-on sea bass, taken off the rest of the bones. Courtesy of mind-boggling kitchen knife gymnastics, it has been transformed into a fish-porcupine hybrid. The flesh has become thick battered fingers which have risen up in the fryer to point accusingly. It’s then drenched in a sweet garlic sauce. God, it’s good. My cheeks become sticky and I feel the limits of appetite as a failure of character. They bring huge segments of pomelo, a thudding member of the citrus family, which we pick at listlessly. I regret there are only two of us here tonight. This place demands enough of you at the table to give the menu and the contents of those tanks a proper seeing to. We have had three beers each and knocked up a bill of £125. A larger party would find it cheaper per head. Downstairs a man has just bought a single huge geoduck at £95 a kilo, which he has paid for in £20s thumbed off a fat bank roll. It has been fished out of the tank, and now its end probes the edge of the bag in which it sits. Stop frowning. At Live Seafood in Manchester, a frisky geoduck heading out the door is all part of the floor show. News bites Like Live Seafood in Manchester, the interior of Seveni, across the road from the Imperial War Museum in south London, is big on fairy lights. It doesn’t do live seafood but it does do a whole lot else: old Beijing copper hotpot, table barbecue and raucous Sichuan dishes. As with Live Seafood, go mob handed to get the most out of it (seveni.co.uk). From 26 November until 26 April 2020, the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge will stage an exhibition called Feast &amp; Fast: The Art of Food in Europe, 1500-1800. It celebrates the preparation of food across the continent, its presentation and what that said about the attitudes of those involved. Intriguingly, it points up how concerns about our relationship with what we eat are not a modern phenomenon (fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk). Amid all the restaurant closure gloom some cheerier news: Pitt Cue, which grew out of an American barbecue food truck before going into administration earlier this year, looks set to make a comeback. Co-founder Jamie Berger has bought back the intellectual property rights to the business. The new Pitt Cue will first make its mark through pop-ups and residences and will concentrate on ‘barbecue, bourbon and beer’.

It is, of course, also a song that’s the dictionary definition of “plaintive”, in which Dolly Parton nails the agony of having one’s life bulldozed, just for kicks, by a flame-haired supervixen. Jolene, I always sensed, was the type of woman who would pay little heed to Dolly’s beggin’ – the game was already over. And, 45 or so years on, this woman’s name still holds connotations of lost love and the inevitability that people will behave like garbage. It is, therefore, a bold set of restaurateurs who would create a beautiful, candlelit space this close to Hackney with a bakery attached, and call it Jolene. That said, if I had to spend an evening listening to some claptrap excuse about why my man “talks about you in his sleep”, I’d want it to occur at a Jeremie Cometto-Lingenheim and David Gingell restaurant. Try to break my heart on a Friday night at Westerns Laundry in Holloway, north London, their previous opening before Jolene, if you dare. That place is so damned affable, and Gingell’s rum baba so sensational, you could announce that you and Jolene were eloping to Bogotá, and I’d grunt, “Ooh, never mind, we got a Friday night table at Westerns.” Then I’d continue stuffing back the tallegio-drenched potato gratin. Every cloud and all that. In actual fact, Jolene is a great date restaurant. Service is immaculate and, being in the spacious converted bottom floor of a three-storey block of flats, the tables aren’t cramped. There’s lots to chat about, too. There is a sense with Jolene, much as with both Westerns Laundry and its owners’ original venture, Primeur in Stoke Newington, that these are people ploughing their own furrow. Yes, small plates, blackboard menus and open kitchens won’t have anyone clutching their pearls nowadays, but at some point in the Jolene incubation, someone flourished a hand over an unlovable industrial space and said something along the lines of, “And here, friends, here is where we will mill pasture-based, chemical-free spelt from the farm of Andy Cato from Groove Armada and turn it into slow-fermented doughs and rustic stews. Let us make the walls uneven hydrolime and decorate the shelves with vintage Hungarian meat troughs, and make our own curtains from vintage linen, embroidered with haunting lyrics from Jolene, such as ‘My happiness depends on you’.” Oh, how I love writing descriptions of cool restaurants that make readers outside London rise from their morning coffee, like someone in Bird Box on Netflix, and start headbutting a wall. Jolene’s small evening menu is, as one would imagine, ever-changing. There was, on the midweek evening I popped by, a smattering of charcuterie – lombo and jamón de Teruel – plus a freshly baked, intensely garlicky garlic bread. All the following dishes I recall as being quite wonderful: nutty brown jerusalem artichokes roasted in rosemary with just the right level of crispness and mushy give; a “risotto” made from spelt with sage-roasted pumpkin and crunchy walnuts; and a plate of fresh, lemon-enlivened tagliatelle with capers and oregano. There were quails in muscat grape sauce on offer, too, and pork loin in apple sauce, but we opted for a chunk of fresh and brilliantly judged hake that came dressed in a green cloak of slightly intoxicating olive salsa. A side of cavolo nero turned up in an oil, garlic and chilli dressing and tossed though with salted ricotta. There’s bias in this review, for sure, because this is my sort of food. Earthy, imaginative, slightly saintly, but with a dirty underbelly of oily, salty largesse in each forkful of spelt, cruciferous veg or sustainably harvested, starchy carb. Yes, Jolene may not be for everyone – Charles put his foot down over the parsnips roasted with pears because, being of French stock, he still holds firm that parsnips are suitable only as donkey sustenance. Jolene also has an all-natural winelist, just as Westerns Laundry does, an occurrence that made my beloved colleague Jay Rayner so fractious that he had to play Autumn Leaves, jazz-piano style, for days, until we found him a decently priced, regular-intervention glass of claret. For me, at least, Jolene is a great place to have up your sleeve. It’s neighbourhoody and completely welcoming, but still ever so slightly pretentious in places. You will leave well fed, and possibly waddling, after the praline choux ring smothered in chocolate sauce. Please take one, just because you can. • Jolene 22 Newington Green, London N16, 020-3887 2309. Open Tues-Sun, 10am-3.30pm (last orders), 6-9.15pm (last orders).

All dishes £4-£14 (apart from shared steak at £42), desserts £8, wines from £23 Being on trend in the restaurant business isn’t difficult, if you’ve got a few miles on the clock: sniff the air to work out which direction the robata grill smoke is blowing from; flick through a few mags with a grizzled “I can do that” frown. It doesn’t matter that you made your name, say, knocking out a massive raviolo or ripping off the Tatin sisters. Why shouldn’t you now do some ersatz take on somewhere called Asia you don’t know much about outside of a sweaty mini break at the Park Hyatt Tokyo? If that’s what the Swarovski-encrusted iPhone crowd want right now, give it to them. Buy in a few trinkets wholesale from that department store in Nihonbashi, stack the fridge with Cristal and offer up a menu full of miso-smeared cod and dishes that punch you in the face repeatedly with gochujang. Yours for £100 a head. Being up to date while remaining true to yourself takes more skill. Chef Ben McKellar and his partner Pamela have it. If you haven’t heard of them, it’s because you don’t live in Brighton, where they have run multiple restaurants for the past 21 years. Their places usually have the word “ginger” in the title. It’s Ben’s way of celebrating his once luscious head of russet hair. I first ate his eminently trustworthy food at the Gingerman inside the mildly formal Drakes Hotel in 2005, and then again in 2008 at a laid-back pub called the Ginger Fox just outside Brighton. Back then, there was a touch of St John to his cooking. I still mutter wistfully about his toast fried in duck fat, laid with horseradish cream and pink folds of roast beef. He might put a mince and onion pie on the menu, but raise the humble to the extravagant, or put a cake of crisped pig’s head alongside slices of fillet. His dishes have always been on the plate what they promise on the menu. And now here’s the shiny Flint House, in a new development within the city’s Lanes. It’s seemingly unlike any other McKellar outpost before, which may explain the absence of “Ginger” in the title. Upstairs is a dining room and cocktail bar looking out over the Brighton rooftops. Downstairs is dominated by a counter around a fully open kitchen for those who like a bit of nerdy cooking theatre. Thrill to the induction hob with its plancha fitting; perv over the Thermomix and the Pacojet, and the prepped ingredients waiting in their plastic pots for their moment. It’s all polished surfaces and sharp angles and yes, of course, small plates because everything is right now. They do not take bookings, because this is meant to be a restlessly modern venture that you fall into and out of at speed. So far so modish. Don’t be distracted. Dig through the unstructured menu, its belt unloosened to the last notch. Take in the nods to Spain and Italy. The bit of the menu headed encouragingly “Fried/toast/snacks”, for example, includes ham croquettes with saffron mayo, which feels like a departure from his overtly British agenda. But you’ll still find the big fat McKellar thumbprint: it’s about solid dishes that don’t sacrifice substance for looks. The béchamel in those croquettes isn’t just flavoured with ham; it’s spun through with ribbons of the stuff, as if determined to make its point. Rock oysters are dressed with an apple and cider-vinegar granita, which makes them brisker than they might already be. We watch a hunk of hispi cabbage being seared on the plancha, until the edges are browned and toffee-like. It comes with a thick, mustardy ravigote sauce below and an autumnal leaf fall of crisped golden onions above. Courgettes are browned and pelted with handfuls of pine nuts and a dollop of confit garlic. A slab of treacly bread is toasted and laid with Ortiz anchovies, the brand name a reassurance. There are rings of lightly pickled onion to send it on its way. As with Ortiz, so with Hannan, the Northern Irish meat producer, who ages his beef in a room lined with the shimmering pink of Himalayan salt. I’m still to work out exactly what the salt does, but I know the beef is exceptionally good. Like some terrible brand fetishist, I relax when I see his name on a menu. A serious cut of that beef is the most expensive dish here at £42 (for sharing). There’s also his ox cheek, cured to a rosy red and given a ride through a sugar pit, to produce something on more than nodding terms with the very best maple-syrup-sweetened bacon. There’s a toasty onion purée beneath. It needs the heavy grating of nose-slapping horseradish to tip it away from cloying. And then there are rings of hugely flavoured lamb’s belly, from an animal with proper time on the hoof, crisped and perched on a pile of the freshest of peas and dressed with more anchovy. For dessert there is muscovado sugar crème brûlée. Apparently, there are blackcurrants in there, too, but all I get are the sultry, caramel tones of the brown sugar. I am rarely convinced that there is much point trying to improve upon a classic vanilla crème brûlée, and this one doesn’t change my mind. Far better is a block of chocolate and pistachio parfaits, pushed together and sandwiched within a biscuit shell alongside a cherry cream. It’s both fun and clever. It’s lunchtime and, to the disgust of many reading this, I’m off the booze. Instead I have a glass of their own rhubarb soda, and feel almost virtuous, even though I surrendered my virtue years ago. My job is to ramble through as much of a menu like this as I can, and I do put my back into it. But sometimes you need to step back from such an experience and work out what it’s for. Over the years the McKellars have run businesses built around the special occasion; restaurants where milestones are marked and devotion is proved. The Flint House is not one of those. It’s about a couple of satisfying dishes, rather than the works. It’s a restaurant that makes its point one dish at a time so that what could seem at first to be just a nice enough lunch or dinner, turns out to have been rather more than that. And every town really could do with a place like that. News bites A little more on McKellar’s thatched pub the Ginger Fox, just outside Hurstpierpoint, 15 minutes from Brighton. It may be chocolate box-pretty but the food is bang up to date. Starters might include a rabbit scotch egg with carrot and chipotle remoulade, followed by venison loin with braised celery and a wild mushroom jus. Sunday lunches, which come fully accessorised, are a highlight (thegingerfox.com). Restaurateur Alan Yau, who launched an entire restaurant sector with Wagamama, before opening Hakkasan and Duck &amp; Rice, has three new ventures in London next year. Two will be in Canary Wharf. Chyna will combine Cantonese and European cookery and boast a ‘water market’ from which customers can choose live seafood. Next to that will be a Japanese place built around counter dining. The third, at Westfield Shopping Centre, will be part of his Turkish street food brand, Yamabahce. Steve Groves, who won Masterchef: The Professionals a decade ago, has another title. He has been named Craft Guilds National Chef of The Year. Groves, who heads the kitchen at Roux at Parliament Square, won with a menu including red mullet with shellfish mousse and bouillabaisse sauce, and suckling pig with Jerusalem artichokes.

Small plates £6-10.50; large plates £15-24; desserts £6-7.50; wines from £30 One day in 1994, while waiting for his new restaurant to open, chef Fergus Henderson went to the Everyman Cinema in Hampstead along with all the other food pervs, for a screening of La Grande Bouffe. At one point the louche dinner party guests, working hard to eat themselves to death, sit around licking the marrow from roasted bones. As Henderson once told me, a lightbulb illuminated above his head. “I thought, there’s a dish for me.” He added a parsley salad, a heap of salt and some toasted sourdough, and created one of the single most copied plates of food of the last quarter century, and rightly so. The shiny gems of marrow melt into the sturdy platform of the toast. A flake or two of salt makes it sing. The bright, acidic parsley salad cuts through the richness. I’ve eaten knock-offs all over the world, often made by chefs who’ve never eaten the original but seen enough pictures to know the principles are sound. And now, 25 years later, I am sitting in Black Axe Mangal in London’s Highbury, eating a pimped version, with go-faster stripes, an aerofoil, a paint job and something involving fuel injection under the hood. The marrow has been topped with a tangle of long-braised oxtail, to literally put some meat back on the bones. It has then been roasted to a crisp. Anchovy is involved. The sourdough has been replaced with a slab of fluffy, singed and blistered flatbread, which belches hot doughy air as you tear. On the side, beneath a thick mustardy vinaigrette, is a candy-coloured red onion and parsley salad. It’s a comically huge plate of food, which slaps you round the chops and slaps you again just to be sure. And then shouts in your ear and finally kicks you in the shins. Even so the lily has not been gilded. Black Axe Mangal’s Lee Tiernan spent years as the head chef of St John Bread and Wine, the spin-off from the mothership, and cooked the original more than enough times to understand the fundamentals. But clearly it had to be his take. This very much is. None of this is news, in the sense of being new. BAM, as it calls itself onomatopoeically, first opened nearly four years ago and all the reports were of huge flavours and noise and queues. You went. You waited, perhaps for an hour or more. You sat in a cramped space with room for just two dozen, with an open kitchen dominated by a graffitied wood-fired oven. Tatted cooks did muscular things with the good food. Guitars roared, cocktails flowed and everybody got sweaty and fed. It sounded like a hoot – just not necessarily my hoot. Three years on, and circumstance presents an opportunity. I have been let down by a new restaurant which cancelled its opening and forgot to mention it. Charmed, I’m sure. So I head with my companion to Highbury Corner where I know there are choices. One is Trullo, which I have already reviewed. (And very nice it is too.) One of them is closed, because it’s a Monday. Which leaves BAM and, praise be, they have a table. The music does indeed boom, though not so you can’t hold a conversation. Still, if you fret about restaurant noise, you won’t enjoy this. That’s fine. There are plenty of other places for the likes of you. If you’re not sure, take the risk. Come let the food rattle your eyeballs. Tiernan (who happens not to be here tonight) has described BAM as a mash-up of bistro and the Turkish mangal grill houses he so adores. The menu changes according to what’s good. Tonight, it starts with a “crispy fuckin rabbit” with sweet chilli and apple. The meat has been slow cooked, formed into a pleasing rectangle, then breaded and deep fried. It is indeed very crisp and very meaty and surfs a wave of sultry heat and sweet courtesy of the slutty sauce it sits upon. A salt beef and sauerkraut steamed bun is essentially a Reuben sandwich with new tailoring. It sits inside an Asian-style rice-dough folded bao, the softness of which gives way to a thick wodge of the cured meat and the crunch sour of the fermented cabbage. We have robust spears of green asparagus under a dollop of creamy goat’s curd. Because the kitchen doesn’t understand the word “enough” there’s also bottarga – cured fish roe (usually grey mullet) grated over the top. It provides a rush of savoury and the sea. A short while ago the food-writing world, or the “gutserati” as I’ve just decided to name them, laughed uproariously at the opening of a new restaurant called Flavour Bastard, as though that was ever going to fly. The website now just carries the petulant words “Flavour Bastard has now shut and will not reopen.” If any restaurant ever deserved to inherit the name as a subtitle, it’s BAM. Not every dish works. A salad of brown shrimp and white cabbage is meant, I think, to be a way of contrasting the nutty bite of the tiny seafood commas against the brusque crunch of the cabbage, but the dressing is salty and one-note. Still, with the small plates priced at around £8, it feels like an affordable misstep. I’m disappointed that the crispy pig cheek, kimchi and burnt lime is finished because they sound like words I could be terrific friends with. Happily, there’s a huge Barnsley chop, the fat-ribboned lamb having taken a virtuous journey through the flames alongside charred hispi cabbage, all of it bathed in the warm benediction of shrimp butter. There are just two desserts tonight: a mango lassi sorbet and a Crunchy Nut choc ice. I think you know which one we shared. There’s a malted milk ice-cream centre beneath a chocolate shell shattering in all the right ways, courtesy of the title ingredient. After too many meals blighted by unwarranted outbreaks of granola, this is a righteous use of breakfast cereal. BAM is not for everyone. It’s probably not for you. Or you. But you over there, you might like it. The place really is noisy, in all ways. They do keep some walk-ins, but at weekends you will have to queue. Given I’m loathe to do so myself, I obviously can’t recommend that. But if you do get a seat, I promise you it will be a meal that will leave a mark, of the right kind. News bites If the notion of roasted bone marrow is calling to you, the Hawksmoor steakhouse group serves it in lots of different ways. In Manchester they’ll give it to you hot with oysters. At Guildhall in the City of London, it’s part of the huge cooked breakfast to share, and in Covent Garden it’s a starter with onions. It’s also offered across the group as an extra with various cuts of steak. Rules, London’s oldest restaurant, has quietly introduced an afternoon cream tea, which is being served in what was once the private dining room where Edward VII entertained his mistress, Lillie Langtry. Tea costs £29.75 per person and includes savoury canapes, followed by scones, cream and jam and then a choice of cakes including Victoria sponge, lemon drizzle and gingerbread with orange. And it’s a sad farewell to Monty’s Deli in London’s Hoxton Street, famed for its salt beef, pastrami and latkes among many other things. While the restaurant will be gone by the end of July, they will continue with their sandwich stalls in both London’s Old Spitalfields Market and Victoria’s Market Halls. Other projects will be announced soon.

Starters £6.75-£9.50, mains and steaks £10.50-£31.50, desserts £5.95-£10.95, wines from £19.50 I know what you want from a review of Miller &amp; Carter. You want venom and spleen, vented. You want to hear about the waste of cattle, slaughtered by a corporate behemoth, intent on cutting both corners and arteries. This is because you are horrid people. I am also horrid, and would glory in the evisceration of a cynical, cookie-cutter catering operation as much as the next sneering, bourgeois, fat-walleted, self-regarding metropolitan sophisticate. You’re going to be disappointed, at least in part. There’s no point visiting a chain restaurant merely to thumb the thesaurus in search of 96 synonyms for “crap”. But I was genuinely curious about Miller &amp; Carter, the steakhouse chain from Mitchells &amp; Butlers, the vast hospitality company behind brands like Harvester and All Bar One. It has yearly revenues of £2bn and makes an annual profit of roughly £300m. Given this scale some people would insist that the word “hospitality” be placed inside heavy, cast-iron inverted commas. There is no Mr Miller or Mrs Carter or vice versa, though there may well be a richly rewarded branding company somewhere. However, when it comes to steak, Miller &amp; Carter talk a good game: full field-to-fork traceability; all from British farms; all aged on the bone for seven days and for at least a further 21 days. They claim to serve more than 1m steaks a year, though perhaps they’re being modest. Since they launched in 2006, they have grown to 116 branches. As Hawksmoor sells 750,000 steaks a year on just eight sites, we can assume this lot shift considerably more. I went to the outpost inside the redbrick warehouse buildings at Liverpool’s Albert Dock. There’s a flag-stoned floor, dark wood tables, a plate-glass wall looking out over the water and a lot of very smiley people working front of house who appear to mean it. They may ask you if you’ve got anything nice planned for the rest of the day, without forcing your mouth into a rictus grin in response. They do not come across as staff who have been chained to a radiator for a month, while being made to watch a badly compiled customer relations PowerPoint on a loop. The menu is a thick piece of crisp, cream-coloured card with a bit of gold embossing of the sort you get on fancy barmitzvah invitations. At the top are starters. At the bottom is the “steak experience”. It’s a model of conciseness. Until you turn the card over and find a terrifying array of further mains. As Groucho Marx might have said, had he been a restaurateur: “These are our dishes. If you don’t like them, we have others.” You want to know about the steaks. There are the standard cuts – sirloin, rib-eye, rump and fillet – in imperial weights, presumably to give it a big old American steakhouse vibe. There are also troubling recommendations that both the rib-eye and rump should be served medium. I take that to mean, “cooked until hope has been murdered and it’s just a tensed cyst of dry protein”. The sirloin is recommended medium rare. Only the fillet is proposed rare. Because I am a completist, I order the Butchers Block 26oz from the list headed “ultimate sharing experience” for £63.50. It includes rib-eye and fillet, plus rump and a marrow bone stuffed with shredded brisket. They say it’s for two. It would feed three. Naturally, it arrives on a wooden board, steak knives tip-down into slots like some testosterone-drenched honour guard. So how are these steaks? They are – wait for it – good. I would even edge towards very good. Their version of medium is my medium rare. They are seared outside and a luscious pink inside. It’s also quality beef, with tension and flavour. It’s a relief. Given that eating steak can be controversial – watch the comments stack up below this review online; warm your hands on their righteous anger; join in, if you have the stamina – it would be hugely dispiriting if 116 steak houses were killing the animals twice. Curiously, the fillet is cut quite thin rather than served as a classic cylinder. I suspect that’s because cooking a thick disc correctly is tricky. In this form it’s 90 seconds a side. There’s also an exceedingly good beef dripping gravy – one that I could quite happily sip neat from a brandy schooner. Price is interesting. I converted the weights and then compared them to Hawksmoor. Both charge around £12 per 100g for fillet. Hawksmoor is cheaper for sirloin at £7.75 as against £8.22 here, and more expensive for rib-eye at £8.25 as against £7.20. However, at Hawksmoor you only get the steak. At Miller &amp; Carter, the price includes an iceberg wedge, a sauce and fries each. That makes it much cheaper. Or at least it would, if the extras were all nice. Yes, that gravy is very good. The béarnaise, however, is so loose it looks like something to which a course of antibiotics should be administered immediately. The “onion loaf” is a sponge for the vegetable oil which was clearly never hot enough. And let us never speak again of the halloumi fries. They just can’t do deep frying here. The bacon crumb with one of the iceberg wedges is undercooked; it needs to be crisp. And the promising “beef dripping jacket chips” are sad, lumpy halves of undercooked, underpeeled potato. There’s a lot of this uneven quality. On a starter sharing platter the macaroni cheese is a model of its kind. The spiced rum BBQ chicken wings are as they’re meant to be: a hit of sweet and sticky. Flabby miniature Yorkshires stuffed with pulled beef are an idea that should never have left the test kitchen. A dessert sharing platter is a bunch of things with the uniformity of confectionary bought in from elsewhere: a mash-soft brownie, a bunch of macarons, a little sorbet. Naturally, it comes on a slate. The wine list includes organic verdejo so is bang up to date. And so, to a verdict: if you live near a Hawksmoor and crave steak, I’d advise you to spend the extra there. But most people don’t live near a Hawksmoor. In which case Miller &amp; Carter really is a fair option. Just order damn carefully. News bites Keeping with the chain theme, my extra recommendation this week is an obscure outfit called Nando’s. OK, not exactly unheard of. But I only recently tried their stir-fried chicken livers and they’re a marvel: sweet and meaty with caramel tones, plus a peri peri kick according to taste. If I’d had them at an independent, I’d not think twice about raving. Hence, I’m doing so now (nandos.co.uk). The homelessness charity Caring in Bristol has joined forces with a group of local chefs for its Caring At Christmas initiative, a pop-up shelter across the festive period for people living on the streets.

Wines from £32 Last week I reviewed a tiny restaurant in Manchester where a bowl of Tyrolean pasta costs £6 and will sustain you through an Alpine winter. The week before I was banging on about a trattoria in Bristol knocking out three courses for £17. I remind you of these things because, unlike those places, this week’s restaurant will require a chunk of your sterling. It is a fancy place in a fancy development of cream-coloured stone that will never be allowed to discolour. The cheapest bottle of wine this week is £32. The only way you can get out of there for less than £100 at dinner is by not doing it properly. It’s all fur coat and mink-lined knickers. But oh my, it’s good. For a time, as I worked my way from one of Ramael Scully’s ravishing dishes to another, I imagined wistfully that I wrote for another newspaper; one read solely by plutocrats, so I could wallow in the aesthetics, rather than banging on apologetically about pounds and pence. Then I decided to stop apologising. Regularly, I get emails from people wanting recommendations for a must-go place in London. Scully, for the moment at least, will be the answer. Moan and complain, or save up. Your call. The eponymous chef is a citizen of everywhere. He was born in Malaysia to a mother of Chinese and Indian heritage and an Irish-Balinese father. He grew up in Sydney. Like so many of the most interesting chefs in London today, he cut his culinary teeth working for Yotam Ottolenghi, notably at Nopi. Accordingly, he cooks from the broadest of larders. There is no doubting the shine and polish on this venture. The space in St James’s Market off Regent Street is a riot of greys, downlighters and clean lines. It looks like those pictures of hot-right-now restaurants in Tallinn or Helsinki slapped across the glossy pages of inflight magazines. All the chefs on show in the open kitchen have the same hair combo: manicured stubble beard, shading into a crew cut. The crockery is in artful shades that should have names like October Leaf Fall or Bruised Cloud. It’s all very tasteful and relaxed, but what matters is the food on that crockery. It’s with the first proper snack that the fireworks go bang. We receive a bowl of crackers made from the long-cooked collagen of beef tendon, presumably then dehydrated before being thrown into the deep-fat fryer. They look like the undulations of a rocky mountainside. With them is a bowl filled with a white foamy pillow of oyster cream. Dig through that and you reach a mess of slow-cooked tomatoes and lardons. It’s umami squared. It’s also misdirection. This is a very meaty dish. They’ve made crackers out of the connective tissue that makes big bovine legs work. And yet the menu at Scully is more interested in non-meat cookery than anything with a pulse. I do order both a fish and a meat dish, because I am dutiful and committed. Both are impressive. But in retrospect I would have been happier exploring the vegetable side of proceedings here in more depth. Aubergine is slow-roasted and spiced then served with the salty-sour punch of preserved lemons. To soften the acidity, there’s a dollop of soft curd. Scattered across all this are handfuls of peppery leaves and the fresh pop and squeak of new season peas. A dish of “forbidden rice” with a “vegetable XO” demands a lot of inverted commas. XO sauce without the quote marks gets its familiar oomph from dried seafood. I’m not sure how they’re doing it here, but there is a rich and compelling nuttiness. It’s topped by discs of daikon, first dehydrated and rehydrated. Is life too short to dehydrate and rehydrate a root vegetable? Apparently not at Scully, where they adore a process. It gives the daikon a pleasing crunch and bite. The most exquisite of these dishes is a salad of yellow and red tomatoes, with green strawberries, shaved young coconut and sprigs of edible flowers, arranged in a crescent. Alongside is a jug of a vivid sweet-sour dressing in shades of red and rust and green. It is that very rare thing: a beautiful dish that is both worth looking at and worth eating. It would also have been fun to investigate the promise of chargrilled broccoli with chinkiang vinegar and salted egg yolk, or dates with smoked pear, maple shitake, hazelnuts and bitter greens. Instead it was a plate of flaked sea trout with Jersey royals and brown shrimps, and a butch, buttery dressing. There’s no doubting the skill of its execution. That moment in the year when Jersey royals first appear is always lovely. But it simply pointed up the fact that animal protein in the centre of the plate gives the kitchen a more straightforward ride. That became more obvious with a terrific dish of slow-cooked goat, marinated in a pulverised mess of chillies and served with black barley and smoked labneh. I wouldn’t ever turn it down. Look at my lovely life: being served roasted goat, smeared in a chilli paste of the gods. But it felt weirdly familiar, compared to the exoticism and invention of the tomato and coconut salad or the aubergine dish. The only real misstep comes with a preserved lemon and tahini brûlée tart. Structurally it is a wonder. There is the crispest of pastry shells and a bronzed glow to the blowtorched surface, one you could almost warm your hands on. The problem is that while a sly edge of salt in a sweet dessert is so very much the thing these days, here it’s a distracting and uncomfortable whack. The yogurt sorbet on the side is spooned away for relief. Pleasingly, the meal is book-ended by another foamy white pillow, this time of iced marshmallow, with roasted rhubarb and a walnut streusel, which is a good word to use instead of granola. It’s the fanciest, smartest version imaginable of the sort of breakfast eaten every morning in a middle-class redoubt like Godalming. Too often in spendy Mayfair restaurants, the expense buys you an amorphous thing called an “experience”. You leave having been indulged by the staff. Scully feels like a rarity, because here it is the cooking – vivid, inventive, idiosyncratic – that is front and centre. A smart restaurant that’s all about food: it could just catch on. News bites Just as at Scully, you could plot a glorious non-meat route through the menu at Shoreditch restaurant St Leonards, led by chefs Jackson Boxer and Andrew Clarke, and be fed very well indeed. Come for burnt leek with almond cream and summer truffle, or their beetroot with black garlic, walnut and crème fraîche. Move on to the hearth-roasted vegetable plate (stleonards.london). The company behind Seedlip, the distilled non-alcoholic spirit cleverly engineered for those who want a proper grown-up drink without hitting the booze, has now launched a sister range of grape juice-based non-alcoholic aperitifs. Aecorn Aperitifs come in dry, bitter and aromatic and are inspired by old English herbal remedies (aecornaperitifs.com). The boom in restaurant-food delivery companies has resulted in an explosion in the use of plastic takeaway boxes, many of which are of non-recyclable. Deliveroo has now announced a clean and re-use service, starting in Cambridge and Oxford, with the expectation it will be rolled out in 2020. Bravo.

I spend half my life there, but at times it’s woefully inaccessible. Not “Kirkstone Pass in a Vauxhall Rascal with worn-out brakes” inaccessible. No, I mean much of the notable dining and friendly service in the Lakes takes place in ultra-spendy luxury resorts, with a minimum two-night stay, at approximately £300 per room. “Yes, I’ll bring my 83-year-old mother and tween niece for a three-hour, 10-plate chef’s journey of citrus bisque and kohlrabi,” I groan mournfully as weekly news arrives of yet another billion-pound stately home renovation aimed at stressy Zurich hedge-fund managers who want to spend 48 hours blasting haplessly at grouse and having £200 hot-stone massages. Which is all lovely, but every week I’m in search of a big, reasonably priced and, above all, welcoming place to take normal folk; one in fact like The Yan at Broadrayne. Somewhere that serves rustic stuff with finesse, but not too much finesse: Cumberland sausage, bowls of buttery mash, sticky toffee pudding or even just a rack of toast with local jams. Somewhere like The Yan that’s open more than 20 hours per week and serves sweet things that appear to be made from scratch, not bought at the local Pioneer food store and thawed out. Somewhere the staff are jolly and not broken by 20 coaches of Beatrix Potter fans every day. “Are you going to ruin this place for us by talking about it?” my brother sighs midway through demolishing one of The Yan’s sharing boards of home-smoked thyme and garlic beef brisket. We’re sitting in a large, carefully restored outbuilding, near the open kitchen, watching chef Will Manley as he dishes up piles of fresh golden onion rings, mini baked potatoes stuffed with garlic butter, grilled corn on the cob, homemade coleslaw. “I’m going to have to tell readers,” I say. “It’s my duty,’ I add, as if I work for MI5, rather than write about tarte tatin with cinnamon whipped cream – available here – for a living. But it does hurt my heart to reveal these things; like whenever I speak of places such as Syke Farm Tea Room at Buttermere, The Drunken Duck at Barngates or Baba Ganoush in Kendal. These places are tiny and special, and all of the world wants to visit the Lakes. There’s a reason Rome has finally cracked and begun asking tourists to curb their enthusiasm. The Yan sits near Grasmere, where millions stop each year to buy gingerbread. It’s close to Helm Crag, which boasts a formation of rocks at the top that resembles (if you squint) a lion nurturing a lamb, or a woman playing a grand piano. This is very exciting the first time you see it as a Cumbrian child, and, although it perhaps fades with the 789th viewing, you never quite numb to the hulking majesty of this landscape. Broadrayne Farm sits above what would have been the flood plain of the valley. The name can be traced back to Norse language and translates as broad “rein” (long strip). The farm has bred some of the best Lakeland Herdwick sheep for miles, and these grey-faced beauties watch impassively as you park your car. The Yan is truly a family affair, with chef Will’s gloriously chipper wife, Jess, and her parents, Dave and Sally, all pitching in. I took my family for early dinner; that kind of 5pm meal you need when you are a mixed bag of diners. We ordered “hummus of the day” (yes, it is ever-changing), which was a well seasoned pea-and-mint affair that came with warm flatbreads. A very good black-pudding scotch egg with a runny yolk appeared on a pickled carrot salad. The Cumberland sausage sharing platter came with excellent creamy mash, braised cabbage and green beans. There was an excellent veggie option of sweet potato with goat’s cheese and pearl barley wrapped in shortcrust, served on garlic green beans. This is thoughtful veggie cooking despite being centre stage on a living farm. We ordered a cookie stack for pudding, which came with a little jug of fresh chocolate milkshake. My mother was delighted to find an old-school summer pudding on the menu, a crimson riot of berries and soaked bread. After many misses and few hits, the thing I love most about taking my family out is the moment when everyone is eating heartily and shuts up. Dinner at Broadrayne was like that.

The Hoist nightclub, for example, despite serving prime, leather-wrapped beefcake, never offered sustainably sourced small plates. Likewise, no one ever joined the 2am queue at Brüt in search of a pleasant soufflé. For these reasons, and more, Vauxhall seemed a peculiar place for the Americans to unveil their shiny new embassy back in January 2018. Until then, our American friends were ensconced in a highly desirable Mayfair spot where US diplomats could choose from a host of local Michelin-starred restaurants – Kai, Murano, Umu, Gymkhana – without the need for a motorcade, or adding to their government’s current £12m in unpaid congestion charges. Regardless, the American attachés and envoys now find themselves a 10-minute walk from Vauxhall station, in a gargantuan, purpose-built, space-age fortress set 100ft back from the road, prettified by ornamental ponds, yet essentially resembling a cross between the Pompidou Centre and the Premier Inn Reading Central. Bringing some decorum to this melée are the Gills, known for The Dairy and Sorella in nearby Clapham, and well-respected among food types for genuine, heartfelt, hard-earned reasons. Yet while The Dairy is fancy-modern and Sorella tipsy-Italian, Darby’s is a culinary bear hug for Robin’s dad, the late jazz musician Earl Darby Gill. It’s a nod of the head to Gill Sr’s adventures while playing trumpet in Chicago and New York in the 1950s and 60s. Darby’s is an Irish-American eating palace that serves a fine yet wholly non-befuddling menu that features Dooncastle oysters and Guinness, native lobster brioche roll with roe mayo, grilled Dexter sirloin with green peppercorn sauce, pappardelle with veal ragù and gildas made with smoked eel (and called “little perverts” on the menu). On my first glance at the list, my eyes lingered on the fresh brown butter waffle with Exmoor caviar, Secret Smokehouse salmon and cultured cream. This is a menu you could whisper into someone’s ear as a niche form of ASMR therapy. Croissant with tonka bean ice-cream. “Seriously buttery” potato mash. How about turbot in seaweed butter with a side of buttered jersey royals with soft herbs? Do you want me to stop now? Did I mention the Tia Maria affogato? Darby’s is one to have up your sleeve for a multitude of eventualities: crowds, client dinners and date nights alike. It’s a large space with subdued lighting and high ceilings. It’s classy, with fast, excellent, knowledgeable service. There’s a bakery, an oyster bar, an open grill and a large sun terrace. But what is it like to eat dinner here on a Friday night in the shadow of the American embassy? Is it full of full-throated Trump fans demanding their steak well done and their portions bigly? No, it is not like that at all. Darby’s reminded me of good, elegant but boozy dinners I’ve had in Washington DC, where people arrived perhaps intending to talk politics but had forgotten all about that by the second martini. From 5pm until 7pm, six Blackwater Wilds oysters and a pint of Guinness will cost you a tenner. A decadent, airy cloud of well-seasoned chicken liver mousse with an unforgettable jerusalem artichoke and truffle “jam” is £12. Fresh slices of fig and walnut sourdough arrived with melted, truffled Baron Bigod, which may well be Britain’s greatest soft cheese. Darby’s winning formula may be a well-worn one, but it’s one that never bores me: and that is simply to take incredible produce and serve it carefully. Or, as Gill puts it on the restaurant website: “Our single philosophy is: ‘We have a wonderful product, let’s try not to feck it up.’” A plate of dayboat monkfish fillet, again in seaweed butter, is heroically good. A side of crisp, beef-fat potatoes turns out to be those thick, crisp, SpongeBob SquarePants-shaped, concertina-style slices of heaven. Two glasses of chablis down, I declared: “This is my favourite restaurant this year.” “But you said that about Xier,” Charles said. “A woman can change her mind,” I replied, while pushing that affogato into my flip-top head, slightly high on the potent shot of espresso poured over malted milk ice-cream. I left Darby’s so jubilant that even the armed security guards holding semi-automatic 10-inch-barrel gas-piston-operated rifles outside the embassy seemed like “a great bunch of lads”.

This is terrifically bad news for cows, but a relief for anyone who finds cutlery arduous. Wahlburgers is actor Mark “Marky Mark” Wahlberg’s fast-food emporium, which opened its first UK branch late last month in a perfect London location (with, apparently, plans to open many more sites over the next few years). Simply exit Covent Garden tube, head on to the cobbled thoroughfare – one of the capital’s most congested tourist hotspots – and there’s Wahlburgers, like an open honey jar to curious, famished ants. I say Wahlburgers is fast food, but the moment one sets foot inside, passing a merchandise stand on the way, there’s a sense this might take time. Shake Shack, another relatively recent US fancy burger import, has greeters who ebulliently welcome diners to join the queue, but at Wahlburgers you’re shown to a table and assigned a waitress with a sense of formality unbefitting a lurid green, unlovingly furnished, part-burger joint, part-sports bar. Assuming the sport in question is “Stalking the Wahlberg family”: screens on every wall play highlights of 10 seasons of Wahlburgers, a reality TV show that follows the high jinks of Mark, Donnie and Paul Wahlberg’s empire. Napkin holders are covered in cute family photos of dinners with Mom, the walls are emblazoned with Mark and Donnie’s movie posters, and the menu is dusted with homespun tributes to Alma’s macaroni “made from scratch”, Jenn’s chicken salad and Mom’s favourite mayo. The Wahlbergs clearly love each other, and this fact seeps from every surface in an unabashed, touchy-feely, American way that sits curiously with us in Blighty, where it’s only really necessary to emote at family members if someone gets cancer, though even then a firm, stoic handshake should suffice. Still, my first read-though of the Wahlburgers menu made me very, very excited, because it is a laminated bombardment of calorie-drenched potential deliciousness. The “Fiesta Burger” with fresh jalapeños, the “Impossible” veggie burger with chilli-spiced tomatoes, hot sloppy joe sandwiches, house-made chilli with chipotle peppers, cobb salad, tater tots, Thanksgiving turkey burgers with stuffing, items encrusted in panko breadcrumbs and boozy milkshakes with frosted icing. Loosen those waistbands! Schedule tomorrow for living meagrely on rice cakes! For now, my friends, we dine. Hang on, the cheapest burger is £9.50, rising quickly to £11-£14 for something a little grander. And a side of smoked bacon mac’n’cheese is £8 how? Staring into the busy open kitchen at the back of the lower floor, you see a team of busy, uniformed workers, much like in any McDonald’s. No one could doubt their focus. So what begins to head in the direction of our table is puzzling. First a cardboard carton half filled with burned sweet potato fries, then a bowl of what appears to be undressed, cheap penne that, on closer inspection, are sitting in a puddle of thin cheese soup. A single black plastic fork stands upright in the middle of it. “Can we have another fork?” I ask, and it instantly feels like one of those impossibly difficult requests. Service is worse than untrained; it’s that sort of trained where they’ve been drilled in answering seven questions only, and anything off-script or requiring empathy or gumption is best avoided. Kate orders the basic “Our Burger” – made with a third of a pound of mixed cuts of Scottish beef, lettuce, tomato, onion, American cheese, pickle and Paul’s signature sauce (best not ask). The sauce, I think, is the best part. My Impossible burger is delicious with caramelised onions and sweet tomatoes masking a fake meat patty to the point that it could actually be beef. Kate leaves half her genuine moo option: “It’s OK, but it’s just not the standard of patty you’d expect for this price.” Here, let’s order a Birthday Cake frappé! “Vanilla ice-cream, vanilla vodka, crème de cocoa, vanilla frosting, whipped cream, rainbow sprinkles.” In my mind’s eye, this will be like your birthday knickerbocker glory at Wimpy in 1981: enormous, multi-layered, gooey, fluffy and joyful. It arrives, and it’s a long, straight pint glass filled with what looks like vanilla Complan with a few hundreds and thousands on the rim of the glass.

In 1997, this was the place that, beyond doubt, set my eye on becoming a restaurant critic, once the old guard began expiring from gout. I spent 65 minutes there one evening, back when it was one of the very coolest places to be seen – other than the top bar at TFI Friday or doing backing vocals for Finley Quaye on Westbourne Grove. Momo, as the hottest restaurant in London, was a perfect, galling example of how places treated their famous, in-crowd guests, as opposed to normal diners who weren’t in Donatella Versace’s retinue. It was certainly a very pretty room – a sort of faux-Marrakesh, enchanted souk – and today it’s largely the same, just even better, complete with a golden, hand-painted dome centre stage, art‑deco sofas, illuminated palm trees and flattering, peach-hued lighting. Back then, the menu was thrust into our hands by a semi-belligerent server with a reminder that our table, booked months in advance, would soon need vacating. Couscous was whisked away mid-mouthful by staff who had one eye on the door in case Patsy Kensit’s hair stylist required emergency shisha advice. An attempt to visit the downstairs ladies’ room became a security issue, incurring warnings that I should not attempt to go off-piste and enter the cocktail bar, favoured by Tom Cruise, because it wasn’t for the likes of you and me. The bill was £46 for two glasses of warm pinot grigio and two tagines. It says more about me than Momo that I’ve simmered on this for 21 years. A satisfying denouement would have been that I returned to review the new Momo one recent Saturday night to find a roaring bin fire of wrongness. Instead, it was an unexpected joy. The front of house are now a smiling squadron who fuss over the entire clientele, which may no longer be A-list, but the West End crowd of moneyed tourists, well-heeled Essex birthday parties, fourth dates edging towards commitment, “Instagram models” and people with interesting facial resculpturing. Under Mourad Mazouz (the man behind Sketch), Momo has clearly weathered the storms of being cool, then uncool, then totally irrelevant, before being shabby, stripped and rebooted. It has certainly got over itself. The new menu, created by chef Hervé Deville, is still a slightly eccentric mishmash of Algerian, Tunisian and Moroccan, but now with modern Mediterranean or, more accurately, British flourishes. Yes, there is chicken couscous and lamb shoulder tagine and scotch beef tangia with green olive panisses (a type of chickpea fritter). The “classic Momo couscous” comes with a small platter of lamb cutlet, spiced chicken thigh and merguez, for £26. It arrived with great fanfare and a clattering of crockery, was as watery as I recalled, and, by and large, a bit style over substance. The dish that melted my heart and righted two decades of hurt, however, was harira, a velvety, spicy, dal-like Moroccan soup brimming with cinnamon, turmeric and ginger. It turned up with spoons of clarified lemon paste and a harissa so hot, it could blow your (new, tighter) face off. Quail pastilla was outstanding, too: a delicate, rich, sweet Moroccan filo pie, as sugary as it was savoury, with nougatine pieces and a potent, blackcurrant sauce. For vegetarians, there’s green asparagus tagine with spiced rhubarb or heritage beetroot couscous, and I shall never forget the frankly weird teff “pancake”. It was a bit like injera flatbread, but also a bit like chocolate swiss roll, albeit one covered in boiled brussels sprouts and chunks of jersey royal, and came with a jug of green harissa bouillon. Momo is still noisy, blaring out the type of dance music that to older ears may feel like being attacked by bees. But if you were entertaining friends, it would be a struggle for anyone to find Momo “boring”. It’s a vibrant place, full of diners who don’t take themselves very seriously, posing for family group shots and singing happy birthday. The food is fine, too, and you can’t say fairer than that. Puddings are worth sticking around for. A plain-sounding riz au lait was possibly the greatest rice pudding I’ve had in this lifetime, served with confit grapefruit and coriander, which should be a culinary car crash, but isn’t. Be warned, though: the chocolate namelaka has a rich bed of diced beetroot and hot harissa lying beneath its cocoa crumble topping. Always order one pudding for the table that divides opinion, because that way there’s a strong chance you’ll get to eat double. So I’ve decided graciously to forgive Momo. The poor things. They scared me off for 20-odd years. They won’t be as lucky again. Momo 23-25 Heddon Street, London W1, 020-7434 4040. Open all week, noon-1am (12.30am Sun).

This is ludicrous. Yes, any badges, banners and gongs that attempt to define whose is the most delicious destination are a little daft – and who cares anyway? – but Manchester, for me at least, feels like a city where so many restaurants are reaching for greatness. Adam Reid at The French is a world-class talent, and I’ve much enthusiasm for the work of Aiden Byrne, now at Restaurant MCR, once of 20 Stories; not even hiding the much-adored Where The Light Gets In over in Stockport fooled inspectors into handing it a star. Yet, despite this continued north-west snubbing, at the end of last year, an ex-Noma chef, Simon Martin, opened an ambitious project called Mana. Think 16 courses, and potentially more, but put aside three hours and £105 a head. Add to that spruce branches as cutlery, flower petals strewn about the place willy-nilly, natural wine flights, foraged stuff, ants, beeswax, picklings, dehydrated scallops, artichoke ice-cream, and cep broth in a cup as an amuse-bouche. Are you still there? Cling on, there’s more. Behold the £300k open kitchen made of compressed stone Dekton at £590 a square metre, the handsome types wearing muted-shade aprons, the pared-back font and Scandi menu design. Oh, and the fact it’s open for dinner only (except on Saturdays), and on just four nights a week at that. Mana is the sort of place that, at the moment, is really only being opened in remoter areas of Somerset, Cornwall and the Lakes, and which involve a 24-hour round trip that somehow lands you with a £300 hotel room bill. (Last week, I was quoted £420 for a 3pm-11am stay in a “cosy” room in Somerset without dinner.) Martin, however, has put Mana on Blossom Street in Ancoats, just north-east of Manchester City centre. I had to love this energy. I should say right now that Mana is influenced by Noma. Martin went there as an intern in 2016 and his tutorship by René Redzepi is clearly present in a million tiny ways. The name doesn’t exactly throw guests off the scent, either. However, Mana loves Noma like Oasis loved The Beatles. Positively, jubilantly, and creating their own buzz in the process. This, as compared with the way in which Glaswegian cover band No-Way-Sis loved Oasis, by honking their way through Supersonic and hoping people were too pissed to notice. To test this out, I took one of Noma’s biggest fans to Mana, and besides some initial quacking about copyright throughout the first 10 minutes, he loved it right through from the opening bars of venison salami with cauliflower fungus to, three hours later, the closing notes of baby pine cone festooned with small, bitter wood ants. Yes, ants. I’m still not sold on this ant malarkey. If they’re all that’s left after global warming, kill me and eat me, too. Each dish at Mana, as one might imagine, is a small, fancifully presented art project. “English tostada with all the flowers of spring” is a play on a tortilla, loaded with petals clinging to its cheesy innards. It’s a “Will this choke me?” sort of mouthful that turns out for the best. A small hedgerow of spruce is delivered to the table with chargrilled langoustine attached to spikes and enlivened with cured egg yolk. Oysters are served dramatically, cooked in chicken fat, wrapped in cabbage, shoved back in their shells and served on dry ice, which appealed to the goth in me. Yakitori eel glazed with yeast and deep, red blackcurrant vinegar is a certain star of the show: it is so incredibly funky. Not in an Earth, Wind &amp; Fire way, but more in a Vincent Price on Jacko’s Thriller “The Funk of 40,000 years” way. A funk that curls your toes with its all-powerful, umami thrust. The natural wine pairing jollies along, as per usual, and comes lovingly described by the clever, friendly sommelier, but it is challenging to drink in parts. “Why can they not just serve normal wine?” asks Charles after the fifth glass, which he claims tastes like bunions. Mind you, he’s one of those people who thinks wine should be “delicious” and “made under strict rules”, and “not taste like apple cider vinegar or actual urine”. Free your mind, Charles. I needed all the wine to help block out the tail of “retired dairy cow” we were then invited to eat with rhubarb and oxalis, and which came with a backstory involving pastures and time resting. I do not entertain such stories. They feel like being taken to see Watership Down as a child, and thinking it’s going to be a pleasant story about bunnies. On much safer ground were two wondrous dishes of gaspingly fresh English peas with caviar and plum and, my very favourite, a bowl of sweet, velvety charred onion petals with fermented barley and kelp. Revealing these dishes feels like standing in the foyer at Vue shouting out spoilers. But there is artichoke ice-cream for pudding. Mana is the sound of Manchester turning a corner.

According to months of social media froth, Arros QD is a hot, new, glamorous, unmissable palace of paella. Artful, strategically placed prawns, expensive rugs, blazing pans and three-Michelin-starred Quique Dacosta with his very tidy beard have bombarded the London foodie ether. Before the doors opened to the paying public, the welcome mat was unfurled to noisemakers who matter, which meant that soon even partially sighted Trafalgar Square pigeons knew Dacosta had come to transform forever the way Britain understands the one-pan comfort food often called “the Spanish Sunday roast”. “For people to understand us, they need to look into the fire,” Dacosta told one interviewer, channelling that type of quasi-spiritual, peak-chef earnestness that puts me in mind of the time David Blaine entered a Perspex box dangling over the Thames and London began pelting it with golf balls. But some way through a small plate of “cheese stones” – lumps of parmesan, manchego cream and cocoa butter that look, in a Heston Blumenthal way, eerily like coal and taste exactly like charcoal-covered mini Babybels – I thought, this is not the place I was sold. It was Arros QD’s first official Saturday evening service, and Dacosta was disappointingly not in town, although I very much enjoyed asking staff where he was, if only to see their eyes bulge like Mr Bean taking a maths exam. His absence or my terrible table, next to the smoke alarm test panel in the least interesting room, may seem moot points, but to sell these two-person paellas that start at £38 for a standard Valencian rabbit and chicken, and quickly leap up to £50 for cuttlefish and prawn and £90 for lobster, one really must buy into the excitement of wide pans bubbling over open fires and world-class chefs shaking them. That’s shaking, not stirring – these thin, flat, meagrely topped, taupe-coloured paellas are not supposed to be stirred; they’re too delicate. Furthermore, the rice here is cooked until its main thrust is a crisp core on the bottom of the pan with blackened parts at the edge. This may challenge anyone who has eaten a thousand paellas, and while accepting that the crunchy bottom, or socarrat, is certainly the best bit, it nevertheless feels to me that the rest of the paella should be plentiful, voluminous, perhaps fluffy, potentially saffron-coloured and certainly brimming generously with seafood. To those people, this may feel like a blackened, very stingy version. “Can I let you into a secret?” our waitress asks in a way that aims to be bantery but is scripted. “The flavour is here underneath the rice where it’s stuck to the pan. You have to scrape. May I?” “Please do!” I say, brightly. It’s pleasant enough: oily, white carb, slightly dry beans, decent chicken and rabbit lying atop the rice, and garlicky from the accompanying aïoli. The “contemporary” paella is a small, rectangular pan, as thin as a kitchen tile and about 30cm long by 2cm deep, and the smoked dashi eel version derives most of its flavour from wisps of katsuobushi – dried, fermented tuna flakes – scattered on top. There’s so little eel, though, that one can remove it in three forkfuls and in the time it takes you to say, “Jesus Christ, that was £32.” On reflection, I feel my mistake at Arros QD was having the paella, which one feels thoroughly obliged to do, because in truth the menu is vast and features the likes of skate wing in chilli miso cooked on charcoal, whole brill with lemon and parsley, and stonebass ceviche with tiger milk. A starter I ordered mainly to be polite – a fresh kale citrus salad with cashew nuts – was an actual zinging marvel with a delightful and accomplished tomato dressing. Another starter of beef tartare, on what was essentially a large poppadom festooned with cured egg yolk and mustard seeds, was less enticing, but it was still better than those damned paellas. I’d had a good pre-dinner Pedro Fizz cocktail (PX, amaretto, black walnut bitters and Moët) in the bar that lives on an upstairs landing and shared a bottle of Finca Calvestra with our food, but by now I sensed the bill hovering close to £150 and felt thoroughly disinclined to stay for pudding. Obviously, come the next morning, I bitterly regretted not having the giant cookie with araguani chocolate, macadamia nuts and vanilla ice-cream. But then, it was Instagram that told me this was unmissable, so that, too, could just be a bunch of arros. • Arros QD 64 Eastcastle Street, London W1, 020-3883 3525.

Lunch: two courses £14, three courses £17. Dinner: starters £7.50-£9, mains £13.50-£18, desserts £6, wines from £17.50 I’m beginning to wonder whether they breed them in tanks, these small, perfectly formed Bristolian restaurants. But that makes them sound like Identikit operations, a catering version of the cabled-up podded bodies in The Matrix, which they are not. Yes, they share qualities. They are usually single rooms, basically furnished, and decorated in shades which run the whole gamut from white to off-cream. They have short menus, written in a clipped prose. The prices are eminently reasonable. If you want a three-course lunch, a really good one that will make you sigh and feel sorry for the friends who are not with you, one which will almost certainly give you change from £20 for food, go to Bristol. After that, however, they all have their own quirks and idiosyncrasies and personalities. In any case, none of these characteristics should be described as exotic. They are the starting points for a good meal out. They direct you down to the food on the plate. And lucky Bristol has a bunch of them: from trailblazers such as Flinty Red and Wilsons, though to Box-E, Pasta Loco and Ripiena. Now there’s Bianchi’s, Pasture, Kensington Arms, Cauldron, the recently relaunched Ethicurean and more… What’s remarkable is not that these restaurants are opened but that, for the most part, they stay open. (Yes, I know; RIP the lovely Wallfish). The people of Bristol support their independents. There are theories. One draws romantically on the radical traditions of the city, which fosters a culture of the independent against the corporate, but I’m not quite up to the task of finding the correct historical references to back this up. More compelling is the fact that slabs of the independent TV industry have relocated to the city from London over the past couple of decades, to comply with production quotas from outside the capital. Here come the producers, fed fat on the trattorias of London’s Charlotte Street, determined to carry on lunching well. They have provided a burning heart of reliable custom from which to build on. Or maybe the good people of Bristol just have far better taste than those of other towns in the United Kingdom. Let’s go with that. For here is Marmo, the Italian for marble. It is indeed a high-ceilinged white box of a room, hung with a few food and wine posters. At the back is a compact open kitchen, staffed by just two cooks for most of our lunch. The new venture belongs to Cosmo and Lily Sterck, who met at the city’s university. Cosmo cut his teeth in the kitchens of St John, Magdalen and Brawn. Lily ran away from the law to join the circus front of house at Six Portland Road and Luca. They know what they are doing. Now they are doing it here. The menu at lunch is almost self-consciously short. There are some snacks, including Cetara anchovies to go with the bread, at £5 for a plateful, or smoked cod’s roe. We ask for the pork crackling and hear the anticipatory fizz of the deep fat fryer as the two sheets of dehydrated skin are puffed, to be served still warm and spice-dusted with a scoop of quince jelly to drag them through. After that it’s a choice of three dishes at each course: one meaty, one pescatarian and one vegetarian. Have just a main course and it will cost you a tenner. Add a starter and it rises to £14. Throw in dessert and you’ll reach the dizzy heights of £17. At dinner the menu is longer and the dishes individually priced, but it is still tough to break through £30 for the food element. How do they keep the prices so low? At lunch, by bolstering many of the plates with carbs, though not in a way that looks cheapskate. Only our starter of mussels with finely shredded leeks and a cider butter broth does not depend upon them. Pick up the spoon and make sure not a drop of that liquor goes back to the kitchen. Folds of mortadella, the pink of a giggling baby’s cheek, come layered over gnocco fritto, those pork fat-enriched pillows of bread, puffed up in the fryer. The plating gives you permission to use your hands to wrap one across the other. Get on with it. Two of the mains are based around their own pasta. There is pumpkin ravioli with sage and walnuts. And then there is my choice, a tangled heap of hand-cut tagliolini, the yellow of the best butter, with the sort of bite which makes chopping off the strands with your teeth a thoroughly satisfying act. The ribbons come spun through with quartered globe artichokes and handfuls of sweet brown shrimps. It’s all brought together by the sort of butter emulsion that you don’t want to let get away. It’s a simple dish but very effective. I would be invading my own privacy if I revealed how much of that sauce landed on my shirt. A Saddleback pork sausage is dense and chunky, with an edge of chitterling honk to it, as if a little offal found its way into the mincer on the way through. It’s the Margaret Rutherford of sausages, big-shouldered and broad of calf and most definitely no-nonsense. It needs the hillock of buttery polenta upon which it sits. There is some grilled red lettuce with a stroppy bitter edge, because we all must have our veg. This is robust cookery, determined to get the best out of the humble. Desserts are also simple but still effective. A scoop of deep dark chocolate mousse comes under a duvet of thick clotted cream dusted with cocoa so it looks like a cappuccino caught in a storm. And then there’s a classic affogato: a dark-roast espresso with a dollop of vanilla ice-cream dropped into it. You scoop up the ice-cream with a spoon, until you realise the time has come to lift the cup and knock it back. We drink a glass each of a Pinot Noir rose from the Loire, which has lots of fruit without being cloying, and end up with a bill for two of less than £70. It would be easy, now, to go off on one about how all restaurants should be like this. And yes, I wish they were. But environment plays its part. It’s about the city’s economics and the expectations of those running restaurants like this. It just makes me happy that right now we have cities like Bristol, playing host to restaurants like Marmo. News bites I love a good outdoor swimming pool. I especially like looking at the one at Bristol Lido, from the comfort of their glass-walled restaurant with its wood-fired oven. The floor show is terrific – all those people exerting themselves – as is the food. Think wood-roasted cauliflower with chickpeas and preserved lemon followed by a Basque-style fish stew or a baked rice dish of wild mushrooms (lidobristol.com). To mark the announcement of this year’s Turner Prize at the Turner Contemporary in Margate in December, the Indian restaurant Ambrette, located opposite the art gallery, is staging a series of meals themed around dishes from the artist’s period. The next two are on 6 and 21 November and include quail scotch eggs, a Raj-era chicken curry with a mango and cognac pie to finish (theambrette.co.uk). Without an announcement, let alone the whiff of a press release, Gordon Ramsay has reopened the space formerly occupied by Maze Grill in the Marriott hotel on London’s Grosvenor square as a steak house called the Gordon Ramsay Bar &amp; Grill. Prices are astonishing. Rib eye costs £13.33 per 100gm as against £8.25 at Hawksmoor and fillet is £22 per 100gm as against £12 at Hawksmoor (gordonramsayrestaurants.com).

Snacks £3.50-£8, small plates £8-£15, large plates £19-£30, desserts £3.50-£9, wines from £27 Movie critics get excited about the latest Scorsese picture. Theatre critics get excited when they hear Tom Stoppard has written a new play. I’m a restaurant critic, so I got excited when I heard about Norma, a new restaurant from the team behind the Stafford hotel. The Stafford is hidden away down one of the lanes off London’s St James’s Street. It’s a neighbourhood occupied by shops selling only things you might want rather than anything you might ever need: a handmade pair of shoes, say, or a £15m superyacht. In 2017, the Stafford became home to the Game Bird, a restaurant nobody thought they needed, but which it turned out I really wanted. The Game Bird was that rare thing, an instant classic, which transformed what had been a moribund dining room where your evening went to die, into a place of joy, albeit spendy joy. You went for the glide of the smoked salmon trolley, and the steak and ale suet pudding in a lake of shiny gravy; for the perfect chicken Kiev that came with its own overtly kinky black leather vest to be worn against Bellagio fountains of garlic butter. Mostly you went for the feeling that in here, everything will be looked after. I am regularly asked to recommend somewhere for a special meal in London. The Game Bird is one of those I most regularly suggest. (The others, because you’re asking, are Margot and Rules.) Earlier this year it was announced that Ben Tish, formerly of the Salt Yard group’s collection of Mediterranean restaurants, was joining the Stafford as chef director. He would also open Norma, which would major on the food of Sicily and its Moorish influences, Tish having recently completed a handsome cookbook called, aptly, Moorish. This was the coming together of people who know exactly what they are doing. If any new restaurant deserved to be taken seriously in this world of gloom and threat, it was this one. It promised to be a place that could keep the gloom at bay. Then again, even the greatest team can screw up. Just ask the people who put together Turn off the Dark, the Spiderman musical. Happily, this lot haven’t screwed up. Norma is the kind of effortless crowd-pleaser that takes serious work. It occupies a narrow townhouse on Charlotte Street, just north of Oxford Street, so that each floor’s dining room has about it the classy glow of a vintage train’s dining car. At the front is a raw bar, the ice stacked with smooth-shelled cherrystone clams and red prawns, curled up against each other. There are booths upholstered in amber plush, and deco-style glass panels. The floor and walls are tiled in a Moorish pattern of interlocking points. All about is a downlit glow. It has a sense of intimacy, without requiring you to be so close to your neighbour you can detect their deodorant. The menu is built around snacks and small plates, with a handful of pastas and chunkier mains. There is an essay to be written, a rather dull, earnest one, about the way classy metropolitan restaurants re-engineer the food of what might look like leftovers into desirable objects for urban taste-chasers. Arancini are just a way to stop you throwing out the uneaten risotto. Likewise, the spaghettini fritters served here, for £6, were once just a way to use up uneaten pasta. The lesson is this: we should all cook more pasta than we need, so it too can be formed into such blissful discs and fried until crisp and golden. Enough parmesan is grated over the top to make them disappear from view. Alongside is a pot of a warm parmesan and olive oil sauce. It’s a fondue that’s taken on a personal trainer and butched up. The whole dish is the domestic, made glamorous. Golden triangles of a kind of bread formed from chickpea purée also come with their own sauce, a strident and aromatic salsa verde. We have halved violet artichokes, trimmed back to the important bits and seared until their edges are caramelised, with a walnut whip-shaped dollop of a pine nut purée. From the raw bar come slices of sea bream with a pinkish glow, dressed with peppery olive oil and both pomegranate seeds and the salty orange promise of bottarga. I could happily have carried on building dinner like this, from the cheery snacks that start at £4 for the chickpea bread, through the fresh promise of the raw bar to the antipasti that tops out at £14. Norma is no one’s version of cheap. Nevertheless, it’s a menu that allows you to get at the good stuff without selling your least favoured child to pay the bill. The wine list has reasonable choice below £35, practically a bargain in this part of town, and all the pasta dishes are £9, though you can upsize if you want one as a main course. The fresh tagliolini is a classic dish with pine nuts, the sweet burst of raisins and broken up fragments of sardine, is cut so thinly it’s closer to an Asian egg noodle. The strands are coated thickly in a pleasingly starchy sauce and demand to be slurped. I order only one of the large plates, a chunky roasted chop of rose veal, with lemon, anchovy and black cabbage, peaking up from a deep puddle of rust-coloured marsala sauce. It’s a hefty £30 and the cut justifies the price, but you need not venture into that part of the menu. Dessert takes the question seriously. There are crisp cannoli shells filled to order with sweetened ricotta cream, rich in orange zest. In an age when tube station kiosks will sell you dusty cannoli with use-by dates, it’s a keen reminder of just how good they should be. There is a choice of granitas; the passion fruit is designed to slap you awake with fruit and acidity. Then there is the star turn: a sweet brioche bun, its crust glazed with crunchy caramel. The bun is sliced open and filled with salted caramel ice cream and chocolate sauce. Which bit of that description isn’t doing it for you? Please don’t tell me. I’ll only think less of you. There is no question: I went into Norma hoping for the best. I always do. Happily, this one delivers on the potential of all those involved. It was that joyous thing: a new restaurant genuinely worth being excited about. News bites While Norma focusses on the food of Italy’s deep south, over in London’s Shoreditch, chef Stevie Parle’s Palatino looks to Rome for inspiration and finds a lot of it. Try the fried squash with crisp sage leaves and honey, or bitter puntarelle with anchovy sauce, followed by that huge crowd pleaser cacio e pepe and then veal saltimbocca with a lip-smacking marsala sauce. Finish with lemon and ricotta cake (palatino.london). If you happen to be visiting Paris and are looking for something to do between meals, a new exhibition, curated by historian Emmanuelle Cronier, has just opened at the Bibliothèque Forney exploring how the French capital has fed itself down the centuries: the short supply chains of the middle ages, the vital role of the markets of Les Halles, through to the role of cafés and food stands in times of crisis. Forney is close to the Bastille. Meanwhile, London’s Borough Market has just launched a click and collect and delivery service from a bunch of traders including Cannon and Cannon charcuterie, Neal’s Yard Dairy, Ted’s Veg and the Ginger Pig. At present delivery is only within a 1.5m radius but they are looking to expand this (goodsixty.co.uk).

Well, we’re not laughing now, are we? OK, we are a bit. But that isn’t to say that Parrillan, by the Hart brothers, creators of Barrafina and El Pastor, is a terrible idea. For what is nicer than barbecuing exemplary produce on a charcoal grill in the great outdoors? No. It’s merely a peculiar idea. Parrillan relies on proper summers, balmy nights and a lack of sideways sleet. Powerful heaters are perched beside every table, to err on the safe side. It is apparently modelled on the Ibizan restaurant Ca’n Pilot, and serves impeccable meats and shellfish – 50-day-aged rump steak, diver-caught scallops, milk-fed lamb’s kidney – all raw, and all at premium prices, then asks you to grill them yourself on your own personal mini grill in the centre of each table. They come with four house sauces: mojo verdo, mojo rojo, salsa ibizenca and, my favourite, a rich, red, almond-based romesco. The whole process is a little fondue-ish, a little Korean barbecue-esque. I’m not sure I wholly approve, but here we are. The hospitality landscape weaves ever more away from the essence of actually being hospitable: app-based ordering, collecting your own food while brandishing a buzzer, queueing for your own drinks, clearing your own plates. Parrillan smashes this out of the park with “Be your own chef”. Literally. Take the middlewhite pork collar (at £11 for just a few slices), arrange it on the grill with pretty tongs, sear it yourself, judge when it’s cooked, then plate up. By 2025, I’ll be showing up at restaurants with a stash of Finish Quantum tablets in my bag and loading the dishwasher. “Darling, let’s not take the Magimix out on the town with us again,” Charles will sigh. “It’s heavy.” “But, sweetheart,” I’ll huff, “I want a pudding. How about I just bring the dough hook?” Still, on the Sunday lunchtime we visit, the place is heaving. As the aroma of top-grade red carabiniero prawns and Iberican pork sweetbreads sizzling on numerous open grills drifts across Coal Drops Yard, the effect is marked. Faces pop up at the side of the cordoned-off area of the outside restaurant terrace like curious meerkats, wowing as plates of Cantabrian anchovies – those very good ones, like unforgettable, caramel-coloured wonders – and pan con tomate (thankfully already prepared) are shipped to our table, alongside plates of presa Iberica de Bellota and escalivada (roast aubergines, tomatoes and peppers drenched in excellent olive oil). We eat, ploughing through money like Aristotle Onassis and Maria Callas anchored off the shore of Antibes: £12 for those anchovies, £14 for shu-toro marinaded tuna, a single scallop at nine quid. We drink a jug of sangria blanca (albariño, brandy, apple juice, grapefruit juice, lemon) while trays of enormo Spanish Xoriguer gin and tonics seem in constant transportation to the other diners. Within 10 minutes, I grow weary of the responsibility of grilling my own lunch, but the men at my table are delighted by the task. Personally, I find the grill a positive boon for obscuring dishes one hopes not to share, such as the patatas panadera (one large spud, chopped, roasted with oil, in a bowl. Very delicious. Five pounds, thank you). Still, there’s no doubt that whatever is occurring “inside” Parrillan seems alluring to everyone outside. Parrillan is a wholly convivial experience. It is sexy and European in a way we’ve decided we’ll have no more of over here soon. Perhaps Parrillan will keep the grills after October, when those Cantabrian anchovies may dry up and we can make Heinz baked bean toasties on them instead. The puddings are very slim on the ground, but the tarta de la casa the day we are there is a mel i mato tart, which is a sort of bottomless cheesecake made with artisanal cheese from Girona strewn with honey and nuts. As we leave, the chef appears and shakes our hands, though I’m still trying to work out whether it was to thank us for coming or to thank us for doing his shift for him. I could have flown to Ibiza for less than we spent at Parrillan. The future feels increasingly silly. I’m merely the conduit. Don’t get all up in my grill. • Parrillan, Stable Street, Coal Drops Yard, London N1, 020-7018 3339. Open all week, noon-10pm. From about £40 a head, plus drinks and service.

This is SW3. No Fifty Cheyne is a neighbourhood restaurant that, relatively speaking, almost nobody needs to frequent over a weekend. If you can afford to have this aesthetically splendid renovation as your local, there’s a strong chance you have other homes to flee to come Friday. No Fifty Cheyne sits close to the Thames, bathed in the iridescent twinkle of Albert Bridge, and blue plaques on nearby walls speak of rose bushes planted by Elizabeth I. Sally Greene, theatre impresario and owner of Ronnie Scott’s, has taken her former Cheyne Walk Brasserie and transformed it into an elegant, grown-up safe space from life’s beastliness. Downstairs is a 70-seat restaurant serving the likes of snail and black pudding vol-au-vent, chicken liver terrine, a 14oz chateaubriand to share, and native lobster. Upstairs is a claret-coloured, womb-like, windowless cocktail snug and, to the right of this, the sort of panelled, bejewelled, sofa-strewn lounge in which one could imagine Marquise Isabelle from Dangerous Liaisons wearing an enormous bonnet and plotting mischief. Obviously, this could all be quite horrific: stiff, sterile and squandersome. Instead, it is the perfect storm of very posh yet also pub-like. The roots of this lie with chef Iain Smith, formerly head chef of Jason Atherton joints Social Eating House and the now-defunct Sosharu. Should No Fifty Cheyne offer a rigid tasting menu, complete with the requisite “emulsions” and “fragments”, the chilly ambience derived from such faffery may have ruined the place, but instead there are grilled lamb chops, beef-dripping chips and pear crumble with custard for pudding. Prices veer from “posh gastropub” to “Jesus Christ, how much?”; from a Herdwick lamb rump main at £29 to lobster at £45 – but then, if you find yourself stuck in Chelsea at the weekend, rather than in your Cotswolds mansion, perhaps a little bisque will be some solace. Overall, the place is, to use the technical term, “a good laugh” and definitely romantic. The staff, led by Benoit Auneau, were jolly, prompt and unobtrusive, the customers largely married couples, some of whom looked as if they had weathered at least a silver anniversary yet still liked a stroll together on a warm spring evening. We ordered three starters, all of them quite brilliant. A satisfying bowl of smoked Scottish salmon arrived on a soft, warm salad of new potato and muscat grape melded together with a pond-green, herby cream. That was followed by dark, squid-ink rice armed with grilled langoustine and scallop, and titivated with an archly bouji champagne sauce that Charles decreed the best thing he’d eaten this year. The vegan option was a wildly ornate salad of shaved beetroot, pickled apple and pear, leaves and refined cashew nut cream. It was a touch sweet; nevertheless, a strong foray into the tricky world of dairy-free fine dining. For vegetarians, there was a slow-cooked hen’s egg with asparagus, morels and wild garlic. Portions erred on the side of healthy, rather than stingy, which is perhaps why the mood was so buoyant. People were simply being fed. Mains continued in a largely faultless manner. A comforting plate of cob chicken – breast and a neat croquette – came with an earthy wild mushroom stew and parsley liquor. A vegan main of braised hispi cabbage with broccolini and young leek doused in a herb-and-tomato olive-oil sauce was a bold, rural romp that I enjoyed, but that went unappreciated by Charles, who was distracted by his aged beef fillet and cheek topped with a generous amount of smoked bone marrow and creamed spinach, which was dictionary-definition largesse. Chelsea dinners of this genre do possibly explain the snugness of some men’s Speedos as they pooter around the Tyrrhenian Sea in their super-yachts come June. And I doubt their waistlines will be helped much by the arrival of No Fifty Cheyne’s pastry chef, Chiara Dello Buono. We loved her perfectly executed poached rhubarb with crisp, caramelised puff pastry, a sublime rhubarb sorbet and rippled chantilly cream. There was little real need for the pretty, perfectly melting hot chocolate fondant in a decadent goo of salted caramel sauce, but we struggled on in the name of research. No Fifty Cheyne’s broad-based menu is for the many, but affordable only by the few. We left and walked down deserted Chelsea streets filled with dark, unoccupied houses. The few had other options. • No Fifty Cheyne 50 Cheyne Walk, London SW3, 020-7376 8787. Open all week, noon-11.30pm (upstairs 5.30pm-midnight Mon-Fri, Sat &amp; Sun noon-midnight).

Snacks and small plates £2.80-£9.80, larger dishes £11.80-£18.80, desserts £4.80-£5.80, wines from £22.80 It is tempting to shove just five words at you and leave it at that: sugar skin Iberico char siu. Mouth them, like some florid incantation: Sugar. Skin. Iberico. Char. Siu. It is not just char siu, that boisterous Cantonese way with roasted pork, involving the aromatics of five spice punched up with fermented bean curd and honey. It is char siu fashioned from Iberico pork, prized for its thick gilding of glistening, ivory fat. No, it’s more than that. It is Iberico char siu with a crisp, sugared skin. Some of you, the pork-eating ones obviously, may feel you need this in your life. I need this in my life. At Wun’s Tea Room and Bar on a corner site in London’s Soho, they serve it just above room temperature and so well rested, it seems to dissolve obligingly on the tongue, leaving just a gust of savoury piggyness and sweet shop sugar, as if whispering, “Do not forget me.” I take another piece, and another. A serving costs £14.80 – every single price ends with 80p – which is a few quid more than you’ll pay in Chinatown, over on the other side of Shaftesbury Avenue. Fair enough. It’s better than the char siu available over there. Wun’s, from the team behind steamed bao specialists Bun House, is a logical development of the UK’s Chinese restaurant sector. For decades Chinese food in Britain meant Cantonese food, often slicked in addictively sweet sauces, because a significant number of the chefs responsible for cooking it had come here from Hong Kong. With the opening up of China over the past few years, we became aware that it’s a country of many provinces, each with their own distinct cooking style. So we rolled our eyes at the apparently banal familiarities of Cantonese and babbled excitedly instead about the fire and punch of the food of Sichuan or Hunan. We cooed over steaming hot pots and skewered meats crusted with chilli and cumin and ribbon noodles from Xinjiang. I say “we”. I mean, I did that. I babbled a lot. The expansion of the Chinese food experience in the UK has been thrilling. I have become skilled at picking through heaps of dried red chillies in search of the fragrant joys within. I have been serious and committed. It was inevitable, therefore, that somebody would decide it was time to swing the pendulum back towards applauding the many virtues of the food of Canton, which is what owners Z He and Alex Peffly have done here. Pass through the upstairs tea room with its artfully distressed brickwork, and head into the basement with its down-lit cocktail bar and its jade green walls and its midcentury modern music cabinet. On the table you will find a drinks menu in the form of a 12-page newspaper. It’s tightly printed, graphically excitable and frankly baffling. There’s a bunch of cocktails, with names that read like word spaghetti: Devilwood and Aged Tangerine, or Mango and Sago, or Salted Lime and Rice? Nope. No idea. There’s a list of Chinese beers with their own thrilling titles: North Cloud Yunnan black lager or Monkey King amber ale. There’s another of whisky, a section of baijiu, their own rice wines, gin and tea. There’s a lot of tea, and a ceremony to go with it. Apparently, every single beverage comes direct from China. Donald Trump would hate it. So there’s that. They offer a gin gimlet. I ask for one made with vodka, but they can’t do that because they have no vodka. Fair enough. It’s not bad if a little sweet. The food menu is a paper checklist, and relatively short. I set to work with a pencil, tongue clasped between teeth in concentration. The result is a mixed experience. The highs are very high indeed. I will return for these dishes, probably by myself so I don’t have to share them. Alongside the char siu are “wind shelter” fried chilli sardines. The crisp-skinned fish rest in a heap of dried red chillies and a golden crumb of salty deep-fried garlic. You eat them and worry that your breath will scare away small children the next day. Then you realise that being scared is character-building for small children, so you don’t care. Their “finger licking” barbecue beef spare ribs are broad flat slices, sawn through the bone (in a way familiar from Korean barbecue). They are heavily sauced, all dark sweet soy stickiness, with huge bone-nibblage potential. You will indeed lick your fingers, because they are impossible to manage with chopsticks. The star dish, and the most expensive at £18.80, is “My gran’s secret recipe sour plum braised duck”, which is a serious come-on but justified. It’s a big steaming bowl of soft meat and crumbling potatoes in a savoury gravy that you’ll want to dab behind your ears. We have rice, piled with pieces of fried lardo and shallots and served in a claypot so hot the rice is starting to crisp at the bottom. Scraping down there with a spoon becomes a mission. I am determined to complete it. Not everything delights. The skewers here – a few trimmed green beans, lined up to look like a raft, a curl of chicken skin, some weirdly unfatty lamb belly – feel like an afterthought and are not particularly good value at £2.80 each. Whole prawns wrapped in spring roll pastry, deep fried and served with a wasabi mayonnaise, are a little greasy. And brussels sprouts in a bland sauce are a reminder of the days when this vegetable was a cruel and unusual punishment meted out to kids. There is, however, a sprightly salad of peanut and crisped noodles to take away the taste. We finish with their egg custard tarts, which are heavy on friable pastry, light on custard and not entirely worth hanging around for. Pop down to one of Soho’s ice-cream parlours instead. Service is cheery if haphazard. Order your dishes in batches, otherwise they will throw everything at you at once. And the cocktail bar doesn’t seem able to keep up with the kitchen; our drinks are ordered long before we order the food, but turn up five minutes after it arrives. That said, compared to most of the waiters working the rooms over on Gerrard Street, where customers are regarded as a dreary inconvenience to be tolerated, those at Wun’s are a delight. Plus, there’s the sugar skin Iberico char siu. Though I may already have mentioned that. News bites A short stroll away from Wun’s, over on the newly reconditioned piazza at the east end of Gerrard Street is Jinli. It’s named after a famous street in Chengdu and accordingly much of the menu is Sichuan, boldly executed. Go with enough friends to explore the lengthy list of dry pot dishes, and the whole sea bass with chilli sauce. Unlike many of Chinatown’s restaurants, it’s a light, bright, high-ceilinged space jinli.co.uk. The Photographers’ Gallery in London’s Soho is staging ‘Feast for the Eyes’, an exhibition, previously staged in New York, examining the history of food in photography.

Stark, stacked, repurposed vessels, often left in previously unloved patches of Croydon, Milton Keynes, York and, obviously, Shoreditch. Rarely beautiful, never comfortable; this is strangely unhospitable hospitality. Visiting the loo often requires a walk elsewhere and the procurement of a secret passcode. Chefs, however, seem to love shipping containers, because they’re a relatively affordable option in which to set up shop. Plus, they’re recycled. Chefs love talking nobly about sustainability – love it. On and on they chunter, saving the world, one food-scrap falafel at a time. Woky Ko: Kaiju is ex-MasterChef finalist Larkin Cen’s third Bristol restaurant (he’s also got a streetfood robata stall in St Nick’s). It felt rude not to pop down en route to the Hay Festival, not only because the first two, Woky Ko: Kauto and Woky Ko: Cargo, are highly regarded, but also because chef John Watson, founder of the well-loved but now sadly defunct No Man’s Grace, has now joined the throng. The latest Woky Ko is in the newest section of Wapping Wharf, which bills itself as part of a “vibrant” harbourside community. Vibrant is a big word to describe Bristol harbour at dusk on a Saturday evening, especially around the Pitcher &amp; Piano/Pryzm nightclub area, which by 7pm feels to anyone over the age of 35 more like an episode of The Magaluf Weekender overcome by a Walking Dead horde. That acknowledged, Wapping Wharf is discreetly tucked away from all that wanton, youthful high jinks. Woky Ko: Kaiju favours a sort-of Japanese izakaya-style cooking, which is a term that defies neat explanation. Japanese after-work snacks? Tokyo tapas? Small plates, saitama style? This third Woky Ko offers, for example, plump, delicious duck meatballs on skewers seared over Binchotan charcoal, doused with a sweet soy “tare” house glaze and served with a generous helping of rich plum sauce, and outstanding plates of Korean fried cauliflower laced with lemongrass and served with an assertive sriracha mayo. Both dishes are worth a detour alone. As does a deceptively simple bowl of tender, robata-grilled shiitake caps sitting in a puddle of roast garlic soy. The brief menu is low on carbs, which prods you to fill up instead on asparagus in a peanut-buttery gado gado-style gloop, toasted edamame beans with rock salt and broccoli in miso, and everything is sourced from local producers such as Grow Bristol and Wild Harbour. Two ramen bowls were on offer that evening: ground pork with mustard greens or those shiitake again, this time with pickled daikon. Neither really took our fancy, so instead we grazed through the rest of the list, taking on cold chicken skin crackling-style, a sort of kosher pork scratching, if you will. Actual hell on a plate for me, personally, but Charles ate it dutifully. Katsu monkfish, at £12 for fish in a curry sauce, lacked much pizzazz or panko breadcrumbs. Braised beef short-rib, again in tare and at £15 the most expensive plate on the menu, was a lesson in softening, blackening and stickifying. Still, although the level of cooking is very high, I can’t say this is a place where one wants to linger. Like all restaurants jammed into shipping containers, it is, in estate agent-speak, “compact” and “cleverly appointed”: 40 covers, a noisy working kitchen, a sit-up bar, half a dozen staff and a queue out of the door, all in one small rectangular space. There’s nothing remotely romantic about Woky Ko: Kaiju. Service began brightly enough, with menus and yuzu gin and tonics dispensed quickly, but as the night wore on, we sat in a blind spot, cluttered by dirty plates, our glasses empty. Eventually, we begged for the detritus to be taken away, after which all of two small dishes were removed before our miso-grilled marshmallow was shoved down among the mess. A further war of attrition commenced when we asked to pay the bill. We left and joined the queue downstairs for the passcode-locked bathrooms, which serve a variety of local bars, had no loo paper and felt like no one’s responsibility. It was all a bit day three at Glastonbury – jolly, but directionless – and although I enjoyed myself, it was Saturday night and I wished I’d gone to a restaurant. • Woky Ko: Kaiju Unit 25 Cargo 2, Wapping Wharf, Bristol, 0117-929 3143.

That’s a notion bound to cause ructions, because almost everything about the humble bagel is contentious. For a start, I’m possibly spelling it wrong. “Stop Americanising beigel!” you may be harrumphing, pronouncing that “ei” as in “Einstein”. Likewise, if you’re a fan of those soft, yielding, handily freezable bagels available in multipacks from supermarkets, many will kvetch that those are merely ring-shaped imposters. Soft? Yielding? Pghhh. A good bagel, some believe, should be an arduous task. The dough must be boiled before baking, in a bid to create a genre of jaw-taxing chewiness that requires a midpoint recovery interval at the four-bites-of-salt-beef-or-chopped-herring stage. One definite is that, historically, good bagels have been found on Brick Lane in the East End of London. However, which shop there – either Beigel Bake or Beigel Shop next door – can call itself the real deal, well, that’s the start of an entirely new bun-fight. The Edinburgh-based chef Tom Kitchin confounded matters more late last year by acquainting me with the work of the Canadian-Jewish bagel bakery owner Larah Bross. Her bagels are 100% organic, pre-boiled in honeywater and baked on longboards wrapped in hessian. The dough is Montreal-style, containing eggs, which makes them softer than a Brick Lane bagel. They taste better, too. There, I’ve said it. Bross Bagels, which now has branches in Leith, Portobello and on Queensferry Street in the Scottish capital, has enjoyed a breathless momentum over the past two years. It’s the sort of infectious happiness that only unabashed carbohydrates stuffed with good stuff such as melted applewood cheese, chicken schnitzel or jalapeño cream cheese can provide. We went to Edinburgh to investigate Michelin-star, high-concept, budget-obliterating joints. Funnily enough, weeks later, it was the hour we passed, mid-morning, upstairs at Bross Bagels’ Leith branch, in its gloriously sparse eating area, upstairs from the hectic, fragrant bakery, that stuck in our minds as the most perfect. Larah Bross’s take on what is permissible as bagel filling will, of course, cause further brouhaha. Indeed, there’s salt beef, pastrami and lox, naturally, with all manner of recognisable bedfellows: dill pickles, red onion, sauerkraut, Russian dressing and crisp capers. But the true beauty of Bross Bagels is how it dances a dainty line between timeworn kosher flavours and tangents of brash, delicious modernity. No one will go hungry here. The Buffanono, for example, is a flurry of deep-fried cauliflower with melted Monterey Jack cheese, buffalo sauce and Mama Bross’s ranch dressing recipe. Or there’s a vegan reuben salt-beef pastiche made with jackfruit, or vegan kimchi sauce to liven up your “Holy Heebster” avo-and-eggs breakfast bagel. And you can shove a hot, fresh latke in anything for an extra £1. I love how Bross Bagels bungs all of these things on its menu with equal billing, and how it calls its bacon bagel “The Goy” and offers “Facon” fake streaky bacon for folk who kind of want to eat swine but also don’t do swine. I also love how there’s a section on the menu called “Fussy Pants”, for any diner who wants anything as abstemious as “a fried egg”. Bross Bagels is a whirlwind of perfectly judged brashness and thoughtful, come-one-come-all affability. Upstairs may be just a bunch of benches, with a small sink to wash your hands in and a few rolls of kitchen paper to wipe your face on, but on a Saturday morning, there are dogs, babies, joggers, vloggers and still-drunk-and-going-home nightshifters, all eating in harmony. Two bagels were especially noteworthy: the chicken parm is a riff on Middlesbrough’s kicking-out-time classic, the “parmo”: a northern English culinary sensation of breaded chicken escalope with cheese that’s best eaten standing up at 2am in a taxi queue wearing a Lipsy frock. The Bross Bagels parm contains schnitzel, melted mozzarella, jalapeños, and Larah’s Uncle Jimmy’s special meshugga marinara sauce: “famous three-day-hangover cure,” it claims on the menu. The parm is a sloppy yet crisp, sweet but slightly hot, honking slab of premium-grade junk food. The “Leither”, meanwhile, is filled with chilli-wafted salmon and jalapeño cream cheese, a scattering of bread-and-butter pickles and a lot of cracked black pepper. The gang down at Beigel Shop in Brick Lane have been serving some of Britain’s greatest bagels since 1855. They didn’t see Larah Bross coming. • Bross Bagels 105 Leith Walk, Leith, Edinburgh EH6, 0131-629 4560. Open Mon-Fri 8.30am-3.30pm, Sat &amp; Sun, 9am-4pm. About £9 a head, plus drinks and service.

One minute, you can pop out to Londis in your dressing gown, drink Gold Blend and have no real opinion on nuno felting, then a shift will occur. One of those incomers will paint over a pebble-dashed terrace with Farrow &amp; Ball Arsenic, open a gluten-free macaron kiosk, and the game will be up. For Kensal Rise and Hackney people, that’s like leaving jam out for ants. Soon, you’ll be knee deep in nocellara olives, spoken-word performances and places like The Rose on Deal high street, a recently tarted-up pub, restaurant and boutique hotel. Any implication that the plutonium-grade revampment of The Rose from rough-and-ready, 200-year-old, old-school boozer to chic magnet for mini-breakers is “an improvement” will doubtless cause the locals umbrage. Nevertheless, it now serves rhubarb mezcal cocktails, tiny bowls of Marcona almonds, wild nettle soup and ox tongue on beetroot. For £200, without dinner, I stayed one Friday night in a bric-a-brac-stuffed room painted in jarring shades of burgundy, turquoise and navy, with a velour curtain in place of a toilet door and a communal Nespresso machine in the corridor. I do not like anyone in this world well enough to forgo a toilet door, while if you speak to me at a communal Nespresso machine at 7am before I have drunk the Nespresso, I will unapologetically hammer you to death with a Muji indoor shoe. Downstairs, the dining room is thankfully less aesthetically busy. There’s an open kitchen, so you can watch the chefs flap, plus a bar to sit up at on stools and order a “Hedgerow Cobbler” made with sloe gin, raspberries, blackberries and elderflower while you nibble very good deep-fried olives stuffed with anchovy. The front-of-house are warm and kind, and there are plenty of them. This goes a long way. Executive chef Rachel O’Sullivan, of Polpo and Spuntino fame, was the name that flavoured all the opening coverage of The Rose last year, but on the evening we visited, she was certainly not present, and the menu seemed a skeleton version of the delicious, complex list I’d seen on Instagram. We chose three of the five starters, beginning with good, home-blitzed taramasalata served with slightly past-their-best radishes. A plate of steamed asparagus appeared, topped with a ladle of gritty, brown and not particularly pleasant walnut-and-anchovy butter. “Hot smoked salmon with pickles and creme fraiche” turned out to be a piece of baked, but now almost cold salmon that was hot neither in flavour nor temperature. And the smoked prawns advertised on the specials board had run out by the time we sat down at 8pm, despite there being only a handful of other diners. By this stage, it had occurred to me that The Rose’s food was clearly not good enough to schedule a special trip to Deal around. But, by God, it feels as if it ought to be: a monumental number of moodboards and Mr &amp; Mrs Smith audience-focused marketing has led to this point, where punters now travel miles and pack overnight bags to dine here. But those who do will find very little to write home about. A main course of hugely overdone smoked haddock arrived with a handful of salty samphire and similarly assertive pangrattato breadcrumbs; the accompanying “soft egg” was at least soft, although I realise I am giving credit here for someone in the kitchen being able to boil an egg. Our other main course of crisp lamb shoulder was fine in a “Sunday roast leftovers” way, but it came on a pulpy bed of skordalia (Greek garlic and potato mash) that was so bland, I argued blindly that it was polenta until we re-examined the menu. We stared at the pudding menu: a chocolate mousse, a panna cotta and a “mess” – as in a crunchy, creamy thing flung into a bowl, not someone chucking napkins about willy-nilly. All of these are puddings contestants choose on MasterChef when they either cannot cook or are being strong-armed into making a pudding. The mess involved stewed rhubarb, pistachios, whipped cream and chunks of honeycomb instead of meringue, and came in a glass dessert bowl. Just like Eton mess, then: after three spoonfuls, I would happily not see it again until next summer. Because of all this, I am now ever so slightly put off moving to Deal and opening a reiki healing centre or mead brewery. The locals will be joyous. • The Rose 91 High Street, Deal, Kent, 01304 389127. Open Weds-Sun, lunch noon-3pm (4pm Sun), dinner 6-9.30pm. About £30 a head, plus drinks and service.

Starters £6-£14; mains £13-£23.50; desserts £6.95; wines from £24.50 I receive an email. It says: “Hi Jay. Hope you are well. We have opened our new restaurant Ashburn SW7 in our hotel recently and was wondering if someone from your food review team would be interested in a dining experience to do a review of our offerings and facilities.” My eye scans down to the bottom. It’s from the development chef of the Holiday Inn on London’s Cromwell Road. I convene a meeting of the review team. There we sit: Me, myself, my ego and I. There is an early consensus that the likelihood of finding a good meal at a Holiday Inn is vanishingly small. I, however, make a robust point. Is it not the height of blunt snobbery to assume that such a place couldn’t serve great food? After all the chef emailed a request that we send one of our number, and why would he do so unless he thought it deserved it? He literally asked for it. My ego nods in agreement. There’s another point. For the most part this column reviews restaurants we choose to visit or not. But there’s another kind, the sort we end up in not out of choice but expediency. We go because we need something to eat and this is the best available option. A quick glance at the map told me this particular Holiday Inn was, for many of its guests, an airport hotel, located beyond the messiest of central London’s traffic with a straight run out to Heathrow. A lot of people would be staying there because they had to, with an evening to kill before getting on a plane and ending up somewhere more interesting. Why shouldn’t this captive audience be fed well? A damn good question, because I’ll cut to the chase. Ashburn SW7 is a dirty stain on its postcode. It has a kitchen completely incapable of executing the menu that has been written for it. If dinner here was the start to your trip, the only good that could come from it is the certain knowledge that after this, the only way would be up. It’s infuriating, because God knows it isn’t cheap. Have three terrible courses and a mediocre bottle of wine for two and you’ll easily be staring at a bill for £120; staring at it, in that wide-eyed, furious way of someone who can’t believe the cynicism of a major hotel chain. It is indeed an airport hotel. The Singapore Airlines cabin crew are boarding a coach as I arrive, and inside the marble-slabbed lobby is dominated by the stutter and groan of aged wheelie cases being dragged to their resting place. The restaurant is a carved-off space up a couple of stairs to one side, dominated by faux bare-brick columns, faux-wood floors and an air of foetid despondency. Men sit alone, with 250ml buckets of wine, pawing at iPads and fumbling absent-mindedly for chips served in mini-chip pan fryers. The saving grace here are the front of house staff, who are all kinds of lovely. They give the impression they genuinely care, which is impressive considering the tiniest of tosses the management seems to give. It’s not their fault the job includes bringing us these plates of terrible food. The menu scampers desperately from France to Italy to Indonesia to the Middle East to Louisiana to China and finally to hell and back again. It’s your private dancer, determined to be whatever you want it to be. Take the “classic” caesar salad. Please, I beg you. Take it. This one includes strands of sweaty undercooked bacon, and half an overly boiled egg with a thick, dark-green ring around the yolk of a sort that comes from overboiling. Nobody in the kitchen cut that egg open and thought: “No, let’s try again.” The leaves are torn into tiny pieces, the dressing tastes of emulsifiers and looped through it all are silvery boquerones or pickled anchovies which have no business being there. (Salted anchovies perhaps, but there should be enough in the Worcestershire sauce which should be in the dressing.) It costs £11. Salt-and-pepper squid turns up looking like badly made goujons of fish that have only just been emptied out of a freezer bag bought on Facebook Marketplace. The heavy breadcrumb shell falls off to reveal half centimetre-thick pieces of chewy squid. A “garlic aioli” is stiff and yellow and tastes only of acidity and profit margin. Bang goes another £9. There’s a couple of dishes from across Asia among the mains. I wonder hopefully whether someone in the kitchen has been allowed to cook from within their own culinary tradition. Hmmm. The beef rendang, advertised as being made with “exotic spices”, is a mud-coloured slippery splatter of a stew, with a blunt hint of tired spice. (For a good version try the one from Enak Enak at Herne Hill market most Sundays. It’s cooked down with cow’s foot and allowed to caramelise on the bottom as it should.) Much worse are seabass fillets, which manage to be both overcooked and have floppy undercooked skin. Alongside is a coffin of crushed potatoes with raw onion, which looks like it has just been turned out of an enamel bowl. The splodges of salsa verde are astringent and harsh. A bowl of chips is just so much blisteringly hot but undercooked potato. For dessert there is a chocolate fondant which boasts a half-liquid centre, but also has a hard, cold bolus in the middle. An apple tatin skitters about the plate when I try to cut in. It is uniform and dark and compressed. We drink a couple of glasses of mediocre wine, one of which we are given for free because ours is the first booking made through Open Table. I accept this freebie. It does at least take away some of the taste. I went to a Holiday Inn and had a shocking meal. I opened the barrel and shot all the fish. But the fact remains: there are too many barrels out there and many more fish in need of shooting. Money has been spent here on the room, staff and ingredients. The result could, if anybody cared enough, be good. But clearly nobody has either the talent or the basic good manners to see to it. The development chef, who I’ve been sparing enough not to name, may regret sending that email. My review team says he bloody should. News bites The Dining Room of the Beaverbrook Hotel near Leatherhead in Surrey is an entirely different kind of inhouse restaurant: it’s a delicate (and, yes, costly) Japanese grill room. The sushi and sashimi are well above average, but the real interest lies with aubergine glazed with yuzu miso or tacos filled with yellowtail or salmon tartare with wasabi, tobiko and crispy seaweed (beaverbrook.co.uk). There’s cheery news for Liverpool: Mission Mars, the company behind the fabulous Albert’s Schloss in Manchester, is to open Albert’s Schenke this summer. It will occupy the Grade II listed Casartelli building on the corner of Hanover Street. As schenke is German for tavern, expect a wide range of beers and rib-sticking Alpine food (wearemissionmars.com). Baba G’s, the Indian-inspired burger outlet which started as a street-food operator, is to open its first permanent restaurant in London’s Camden Market. While they initially secured investment through the TV series Million Pound Menu, they are going it alone for this venture (bhangraburger.com).

Be aware. If you ask chef Brian Donnelly of Bia Rebel to explain how he makes his food, he will tell you. He will go into quite extraordinary detail. There will be hand gestures and a lot of enthusiasm. If you’re a little short on time, perhaps it’s best just to order and keep the questions to a minimum. Otherwise, do ask, because it’s a hell of a story, with a beginning, a middle and an end, that end being the engrossing bowl of ramen he will serve you. This is the thing: we are used to lengthy, sweaty-palmed stories around complex dishes, but for the most part they come greased with excess and largesse and huge price tags. The great Pierre Koffmann’s recipe for braised pig’s trotter, boned and stuffed with a chicken mousseline and morels, then glazed with a veal and madeira jus, takes pages of a cookery book, and days to prepare (not forgetting years of training to perfect; it requires surgical skill to bone out a trotter). We therefore accept that we will have to sell the most attractive of our limbs to pay for it. But an £8 bowl of ramen? That surely doesn’t deserve prose poems? Well why the hell not? The result may seem humble, but getting it right certainly isn’t. Donnelly grew up in Northern Ireland, but learned his trade at Gordon Ramsay’s Aubergine and Le Gavroche with Michel Roux Jnr, before crossing back over the Irish Sea to be head chef of Thornton’s in Dublin. He has run massive brigades. He can do things with knives and knows one end of a sauce from another. Now, with his business partner Jenny Holland, he brings all of that to the task of running a small ramen shop on the Ormeau Road in Belfast. It has a few seats at a counter, a long communal table down the middle of the room for a few more, and a vibrant mural on the wall demanding you #slurpmynoodles. The setting may be different, but the culinary intensity is just the same. Last autumn, Bia Rebel – bia is Irish for food – won the best cheap eats gong in the Observer Food Monthly awards, voted for by the readers. Being in the city for a day or two, it seemed only fair that I drag a few friends along to try it out. Happily, I can confirm our readers have impeccable taste. Does Bia Rebel serve the very best bowl of ramen you will ever eat in the United Kingdom? No, not quite. I’d put that served by Tonkotsu, Shoryu and Nanban (the latter run by my friend Tim Anderson) above it. But then that’s extremely tough competition. In any case, I don’t believe it is trying to compete, and its offering also happens to be a lot cheaper than those others. As Jenny Holland said when they won the OFM award last year, “We’re not trying to be Japanese. We’re an Irish restaurant. It just so happens this wonderful, perfect dish we’re making is considered Japanese. Provided you adhere to basic building blocks you can make it what you want.” Which is what they do. They make their own wheat noodles. Their meaty broth has 26 ingredients and takes 40 hours to make. Donnelly starts with a sofrito, the finest dice of vegetables cooked down until they have given all they have to give to a dish, which apparently takes hours. A chicken broth is made with chicken wings, also cooked for hours. It is blended with dashi broth. They add a 606 egg, so called because it is cooked in a water bath for six minutes and six seconds. You sense that Donnelly loves that detail. He then smokes it over Oolong tea. Not Lapsang souchong or Darjeeling. Oolong. It is a very good egg, the smoky yolk perfectly fixed in that place between runny and set. There are around 10 permutations on the basic theme. The Belfast Shoyu ramen contains thick slices of chashu-roasted pork, a beautiful reddy bronze, here made with shoulder rather than the classic belly. “We use shoulder because the balance of fat to meat suits the Northern Irish palate,” Donnelly says. What matters most, of course, is the broth, which is swimming pool deep and savoury, without leaving you fearing you’ll be chugging water through a restless night’s sleep. The noodles have a fair bite. (According to Tim Anderson, ramen wheat noodles must be made with kansui alkaline water. I’ll confess I didn’t check the pH level of the noodles. This is remiss of me.) Rebel spicy pork ramen is a vibrant Hades-red, courtesy of deep slicks of chilli oil, and comes heaped with piles of ground pork, flavoured with more chillies. Most of them work like this: the name of the dish tells you what you’re going to get. The meat in a Celtic spicy beef ramen has indeed been introduced to a lot of fresh chilli; the hoisin BBQ pulled pork ramen has pulled shoulder spun through with hoisin. It is both sweet and salty. All of them come stacked with nori and spring onions, sweetcorn and fresh chilli or garlic. On a frigid winter’s night in Belfast their various ramens feel less like a bowl of dinner than a guttering fireside in front of which to warm yourself. The only item which made me furrow my brow is the achingly named Ramenara Ramen, which they say is their take on a carbonara, involving bacon and parmesan cheese. Mind you, Anderson once made a full English breakfast ramen, so let’s not get too precious. To start, there are various silky-skinned gyoza – duck and hoisin, chicken and chilli, or veg – which they buy in, alongside edamame beans to be pulled meditatively between teeth, seaweed salad or potato salad. There are chicken wings, which they’ve run out of the night we are there, and heaving plates of well-stacked fried rice. It is not licensed, but we had made a run past the off-licence first. Bia Rebel owns a corkscrew. For the most part, what you get, apart from a satisfyingly full belly, is the sense of what is too often referred to spuriously as a passion project. This is the real thing. Apparently, their contract of employment includes one instruction: “Don’t be a dick.” This is a sentiment we can all get behind. Nice people. Good food. Great price. Six words which tell you all you need to know. But then you’d have had nothing to read on a Sunday morning. News Bites Shoryu is a growing chain of ramen shops – there are nine in London, plus others in Manchester and Oxford – but they keep standards up, and offer a broader menu than most. Alongside more than half a dozen tonkotsu ramen, named for the 12-hour pork broth full of sticky gelatine, there’s a bunch of other choices, plus a list of sides, including buns filled with everything from chicken karaage to pumpkin croquettes. All change in Rock, Cornwall, where chef Nathan Outlaw has stepped away from the Mariner’s pub and been replaced by one of the other big culinary names in those parts, Paul Ainsworth of No 6 and his partner Emma. The move comes as Outlaw prepares to launch a seafood restaurant at the Goring Hotel in London. Kenny Tutt, winner of last year’s amateur MasterChef, has left his job as a bank manager and is to open his first restaurant in his home town of Worthing. It will, he says, draw inspiration from “the local area and surrounding Sussex countryside”.

Starters £6.50-£8, main courses £11-£15, desserts £3-£6, wines from £22 Few people would describe the building at 40 Hoxton Street as a glamorous landmark, probably not even the architect’s mother. It is a block of yellow brick, with a few glacial cliffs of glass so the light can get in. There are vaguely interesting spindly design features put there, I think, to stop it looking too much like a correctional facility. It is a building with a purpose for which it is fit. So no, not a landmark. Instead, a beacon of hope. This is the Hackney campus of New City College. Just down the road is Old Street, which is fatly stuffed with restaurants. There’s the Tramshed by Mark Hix with, in the middle, its original Damien Hirst cow in a glass box. There’s the garlanded fancies of the Clove Club with its £145-a-head tasting menu. There are Vietnamese grill houses and Korean cafés. In this bit of Shoreditch, the gutters fair run with sriracha. I say that admiringly. You can eat well and often along here. But none of those establishments is as important as the one inside New City College. OKN1, which stands for Open Kitchen (and the postcode), is a full-service restaurant providing in-work experience alongside professionals for the students on the college’s catering and hospitality courses. The kitchen is run by chefs with experience at the likes of Dean Street Townhouse. The rest of the brigade is working their way to certificates and grades. Forgive me if I come over all Whitney Houston for a moment, but these students are our future. Teach them well and let them lead the way. If that’s made you feel queasy, I can’t apologise. The kitchen is a broad, open space, its walls pasted with pictures of what plated dishes should look like. The students are learning that a life in restaurants is not primarily about expressing your passion in the kitchen. It’s not about going on a journey, or feeling the throbbing pulse of creation’s teat in the palm of your hand as mother nature proffers up its bounty. It’s about attention to detail and nailing processes and repetition. And then doing it all again. Once you’ve got that sorted, then you can get your hands on the throbbing teat. If you were to draw up a list of dishes you think catering students should learn, it would look very much like the menu here at OKN1. Nothing will surprise you with its inventiveness. No envelopes are being pushed. Instead what they will do is sate your appetite very nicely, with dishes which combine blessed familiarity with faultless execution and at a price that makes sense: £6.50 a starter; £12.50 a main course? Yes please. We order their sourdough. In a city that now fetishises this bread as if it were the one true loaf, OKN1 holds its own: a crisp crust, a springy crumb and just enough acidity to remind you why the word sour is in the title without making you wince. For starters we have a perfect bit of classical training made flesh: a ham hock and chicken terrine, served at room temperature so the light glazing of jelly is starting to melt. Too often terrines end up overly compressed, by a kitchen fearful the damn thing will fall apart, when what they really need is a sharp knife to cut it. This is loosely textured, and robustly seasoned, and shiny with olive oil and cracked black pepper. It comes with thick slices of still-warm brioche and their own fig chutney, which is dark and glossy and heavy with full fruit. No, not ground-breaking, just a really good starter. There is a salad of hot smoked salmon and baby gem, with lightly charred corn kernels, dressed with the glint of pomegranate seeds and a bold vinaigrette. We follow that with two dishes nicked wholesale from the menu at Robin’s Nest (look it up, kids): moules marinère and a chicken Kiev. Some of you will now be dreaming of simpler times when there were three TV channels. Others may think it all sounds a little too basic. But I’d much prefer a trainee cook who can make these dishes well, over one who knows how to take a blowtorch to a mackerel or thinks partnering lamb with granola is a good idea. The mussels are big meaty numbers in a thick broth that is the blessed union of smoked bacon, slow-cooked onions and cider, invited to hang out in each other’s company for as long as it takes. The chicken Kiev is plump and crisp, and filled with a righteous basting of garlic butter. It perches on a thick lake of white bean purée punched up with Marmite butter, the closest they come to a culinary flourish. Chips are hand-cut, hot and crisp. Green beans come under a snowfall of grated parmesan with the poke and fire of fresh red chilli. Desserts, a prosecco and raspberry posset, and a strawberry and citrus shortbread cheesecake, both presented in a tumbler, could be dismissed as mere creamy things in a bowl. But both come with their own bit of oven-warm baking. The posset is double-cream-thick, crusted with sugar and chocolate sprinkles, and accompanied by crisp shortbread biscuits that snap between fingers and teeth; the cheesecake cream has blitzed digestive crumb below and chopped strawberries above and on the side, night-black sugar charcoal biscuits. There is a mildly featureless dining room inside with chairs that, like those dishes’ titles, also recall Robin’s Nest. But then this is a functional inner-city college restaurant. The key thing is that it functions very well. Tonight, however, it is empty. Instead we eat on the terrace out the back overlooking the college lawn, one of those bits of lush greenery the inner city keeps to itself, where urban foxes scamper shamelessly. A terrine, a chicken Kiev, a cheesecake. Or instead, a salad, moules marinière and a posset. These are not menus for which trumpets will be sounded. But executed well by skilled chefs in waiting, at a fair price, they are deeply heartening. The future of the restaurant business could be in good hands. All it needs is a few more customers. If you like eating out, do your bit for the industry and go there. Trust me, it won’t be a sacrifice. News bites The highly regarded catering course at the Lake District’s Kendal College closed their stand-alone training restaurant, Castle Dairy, in March. They now run a service three lunchtimes and one evening a week, from within the college during termtime, starting this Tuesday.

The Thursday evening service costs £24. kendal.ac.uk Starting 30 September, Parker’s Tavern in Cambridge is running a monthly series of dinners called Rubbish Cooks.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(393,'2019-07-26T09:00:11Z','Lucky Cat, W1: ‘Waves of buyer’s remorse sweep over me’ – restaurant review | Grace Dent','Several people were perplexed as to why Gordon Ramsay would feel pressed to open a gargantuan, Japanese-ish restaurant, his first venture of this genre, and place it in Mayfair, the most prohibitively expensive area of London. Yet, of a Friday evening in July, soon after Lucky Cat’s many dozen welcoming maneki-neko felines began waggling their paws on the walls, I scanned his new venture’s heaving room and thought, “Ah, yes, this all makes perfect sense.” My teensy plate of prawn toast had just arrived: four circular, 50p-sized lumps of prawn toast laced with sesame kimchi for eight quid. A white geisha – vodka, sake syrup, yuzu – arrives with its frothy egg white embossed rather eerily with an ornate, electric-blue geisha’s face that will not dissolve regardless of how hard one slurps. Around me, a buoyant crowd – a mix of moneyed tourist couples, business dinners and special-occasion parties – are flinging money hand over fist at single duck legs caked in bonito and served with a bao bun (which is northern Chinese). Ramsay’s name is still as tantalising as it was, for example, in 2004, when he was reaching peak shouty-man and screaming into Edwina Currie’s face on ITV. In fact, no – Ramsay is a different level of magnetic now. He is a Wolfgang Puck in Las Vegas draw, in that diners who may eat out only once a year, perhaps on vacation, will stumble inside in a zombie-like fugue, pointed there by the hotel concierge, towards a name they’ve seen on the telly, before being cajoled into spending two, three, maybe four hundred pounds on teeth-chatteringly sweet saikyo miso black cod and bowls of unremarkable steamed rice. Ramsay was not at the stoves in the vast open kitchen, close to a selection of open-plan “private dining” areas that are not remotely private. Neither is his name or image anywhere. In many ways, though, his work was already done: Ramsay’s star power guaranteed the sort of pre-buzz required to finance a hulking, gorgeous, sexily lit, mock-1930s Tokyo drinking club with marble-trimmed bars, bronze-flecked bamboo panelling and jewel-box tiled flooring. And did I mention the cats? The waving cats? Always waving. Waving goodbye to Friday night as you order a 16-quid negroni and peruse the relatively small, double-sided cardboard, pan-Asian menu. Waving goodbye to next month’s mortgage payment as you note that the duck leg – albeit delicious, sticky, crunchy, fatty and served with cucumber and a half-decent pillowy bao – is £27. At these prices, everything should be exquisite, which it very much is not. Service is chaotic. There are more staff on the floor, swaying and mouthing nonsense, than at the closing number of Live Aid in 1985. Dishes you didn’t order appear at the table, and when you call the server back for more information, they’re either as confused as you are, or make up another name for them. Four slices of bland, flabby “smoked shortrib” turn up with some daikon, yuzu pickle and chilli oil for £17. “Um, excuse me. We can’t work out what this is,” I say. “It’s the pastrami … I think,” says a waiter, walking away. Monkfish cheek katsu with a dipping bowl of wasabi and seaweed “emulsion” is fiercely fishy and semi-inedible, like overcooked pub scampi, and a long plate of tuna tataki comes swimming in wakame oil and house soy. This isn’t even the best sort-of-Japanese food being served within a mile radius: there are more delicious things rolling around the conveyer belt at the Yo Sushi! on nearby Woodstock Street, but then, if you’d asked the 12-strong table of delightfully dressed-up ladies – mini frocks, moisturised legs, lots of hair – who were out celebrating their friend’s 21st whether they’d rather be in a chain restaurant with riff-raff or having the time of their life at the hot, new Gordon Ramsay place, they’d no doubt look at you as if you were daft. Pudding is a pineappley spin on rum baba, called a “yum baba” (cough) and served with coconut-based cream. It feels microwaved: chewy and hot in some places, in others not. By this point, I felt I’d given things a really good shot, but a peculiar sense of buyer’s remorse always sweeps over me during dinners such as this, especially as you can see the bill mount up. Also, Lucky Cat doesn’t need me. My feelings will make no difference to its audience. Ten fresh planeloads of business-class passengers will have touched down at Heathrow while you’ve been reading this. They are all feeling lucky about dinner tonight.

It’s terrifically handy, I’m sure, when you’re starting a new restaurant and want to attract attention, as Emily Roux, daughter of Michel Jr and grandchild of Albert, proved last October when unveiling Caractère in Notting Hill, west London. Still, the name Roux also means Le Gavroche in Mayfair, a dining spot that will be cited time and again by chefs and experts as not merely a restaurant, but the restaurant. Le Gavroche is a chintzy Mecca for stuffed shirts, and it’s catnip to moneyed baby boomers who want a real occasion that involves highfalutin but ultimately identifiable French classics – filet de boeuf, mousselline de homard – and impeccable, forlock-tugging service. These people will be disappointed by Caractère, however, because it offers neither of these things. This Italian-French joint took the place of a branch of Bumpkin on a corner of Westbourne Park Grove, and has Brett Graham’s The Ledbury and Clare Smyth’s Core close at hand. But Caractère’s menu is set out in such an opaque manner – split into six sections marked “curious”, “subtle”, “delicate”, “robust”, “strong” and “greedy” – that the server immediately caves as he hands over the list, explaining which ones are starters, mains and puddings. He needs to, or else nobody would get fed. What makes a fancy braised leek tart or scallops on radicchio “curious”? Or roast jerusalem artichokes on beurre noisette “subtle”? And if you’re paying 11 quid for a bowl of chocolate pudding, do you really want to be called “greedy”? Caractère is the only time in dining history that I’d have seized upon the waiter’s “Can I explain the concept?”, had it been offered, with great glee and purely for the ride. People with English literature MAs specialising in magical realism could not decipher this “concept”. Even so, those jerusalem artichokes are utterly delicious, served on a pureed patch of their own innards with slivers of hibiscus flower and a crisp layer of compressed wild rice. Chef Diego Ferrari, the other half of both Caractère and Emily Roux, and a man with a name like a heartbreaking polo player in a Jilly Cooper bonkbuster, was head chef at Le Gavroche for three years. It is beyond doubt that he can cook but, more than that, he is some sort of zen master of flavour. These two things are not mutually exclusive in pricey restaurant world. Emily’s dad’s Roux at the Landau left me as cold as a sorbet after a succession of sous vide-tormented items in consommé were delivered with multi-bodied fanfare. Caractère, however, is much more of a trip, a place where Ferrari has thrown off the fine-dining shackles and started serving a playful, satisfying bale of cacio e pepe “pasta” formed from celeriac. (So playful, in fact, that I read a great online kvetching session in which one diner moans that his pasta was far too al dente.) Before that, lest I forget, came a pre-dinner, complimentary “snack” of a mock Bourbon biscuit – larger, slightly salty, embossed with the word “bourbon” and piped with sardine paste. It was the culinary exploration that literally no one with tastebuds was crying out for. Not delicious, yet not wholly offensive, leaving one rather proud of one’s inner mettle for finishing it. I had no such uncertainty about the perfectly sating marsala risotto made with acquarello rice – a type of aged carnaroli – and strewn with pink peppercorns. It’s a pink, wobbly blob on a plate, not dissimilar to something you’d see while flicking your TV remote past a show about surgery but, taste-wise, it’s quite breathtaking, with blobs of almondy praline and sticky, reduced wine. There is lots to love at Caractère – even if the unisex bathroom means you have to powder your nose beside a steady flow of confused male Notting Hill old guard jumping out of their skin, double-checking the door and barking, “Is this toilet transsexual?” To which the only answer can be, “Yes, sir, it is presently identifying as genderqueer.” And even if the winelist gives a quick nod to £30 plonk, heads swiftly into the 75-quid range, before hurtling into £300-£400 territory. Service was a car crash, though: dinner took three hours, and that chocolate pudding arrived as I was taking out my contact lenses and applying Sunday Riley Luna Oil. We had fallen into that Arthur C Clarke Mysterious World of diner invisibility, and I was still begging for the bill as the kitchen staff donned anoraks and left via the front door. This Roux joint is not Le Gavroche, and it has a caractère all of its own. Like its starters, I remain curious. • Caractère 209 Westbourne Park Road, London W11, 020-8181 3850.

This was surprising because Wei Guirong, a Xi’an noodle specialist, recently opened the doors of her first solo venture to much excitement from the type of folk who can tell hand-pulled biang biang noodles from cold skin liangpi, and feasibly do not hold the King Bombay Bad Boy Pot Noodle in terribly high esteem. “Biang biang” relates to the onomatopoeic sound of the fat, flat dough strands as they’re stretched and shaken into shape. They hail from Shaanxi province. I am not an expert on the geographical nooks of China’s 9.6bn sq km, but I am a consummate professional at consuming large amounts of biang biang, savouring how their flat, sturdy, slippery surface gives great purchase to thrusts of garlic, oil, spring onion, ground chilli and peppercorn. Biang biang, to the unaccustomed eye, might look more like sparsely dressed pappardelle than vegetable-packed, sauce-soaked chow fun Cantonese noodles. They are substance deliciously overriding style, like all the very best foodstuffs. Wei Guirong’s first restaurant, Xi’an Impression, is tucked around the back of the Arsenal football stadium. Her new venture is down a side street between Holborn and Russell Square, hiding behind an unpromising shop front in a no man’s land of the type of “budget” London hotels where 170 quid buys you one night in a partially vented room the size of a Barbie caravan. It is weird, in a way, that she has set up home showcasing authentic Xi’an food, still a relative rarity on these shores, in this isolated area, but then everything in the restaurant world is weird right now. When I dined there, trade was roaring via Deliveroo: a steady stream of bikers appeared, loitered, loaded up and left. Some people, somewhere – possibly the large surrounding student population – were certainly paying for and demolishing Master Wei’s delicate, hand-shredded vinegary chicken, the dank delights of its spicy wood ear mushrooms with coriander or the cumin beef “burger”, a sort of heavily scented, loose-form patty in a non-delicate, flatbread-style bun. Whether Deliveroo, Just Eat et al are aiding or assassinating the restaurant industry is debatable, but a restaurant’s ambience does not benefit from metaphorical tumbleweeds. Still, if you do put on pants and leave the house, Master Wei is pretty damned good. And that spicy chicken is remarkable: deftly doused in a piquant, sour-sweet ginger dressing with slivers of sweet pepper. It may, at first glimpse, look like a plate of pale-brown nothingness, but stay tuned. The cumin burger is an acquired taste, let down slightly by a bun that’s like something you might find vacuum-packed at the newsagent. Thinly sliced kelp was magnificent and came with a bowl of pickled veg that was a face-twisting blend of kimchi and punchily on-the-turn carrots. A basket of chicken pot-sticker dumplings certainly looked the part – flat, brown on all the right surfaces, stodgy and a touch oily – but the flavour was less than earth-shattering. Still, despite these highs and lows, and the fact that service from the cheery waitresses was of that comedic level of neglect that you can’t even be cross at, I’ll return to Master Wei, on my own, whenever the opportunity arises, led by my craving for its biang biang noodles. I now know why the few other diners were flying solo, wearing headphones or eating with a newspaper for company. Master Wei’s biang biang create a longing for comforting carbohydrate with a kick that creeps up on you. This despite the vegetarian version looking like little more than a bowl of boiled dough and a few choi sum leaves. But that oily, hot, peppery umami undercurrent settles in after a few slurps to something emotionally stirring. Biang biang noodles are an assertive culinary hug. It is a dish that wants what is best for you. The beef option comes with a non-pretty scattering of brown, chewy meat, while the pork features stewed tomato and egg. The xin jiang hand-pulled noodles are less lovable, though, with a weaker, more watery sauce and a reliance on soft chicken skin and par-boiled chunks of potato. After some begging to pay our bill, we left the empty restaurant with more questions about Master Wei than we started with. It is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, in a spicy dressing, with a loyal audience that’s too lazy to visit. But I shall continue to biang biang on about it. • Master Wei 13 Cosmo Place, London WC1, 020-7209 6888. Open all week 11.30am-10pm (10.30pm Fri &amp; Sat, Sun noon-10pm).

Snacks and small dishes £5-£12. Larger dishes £12-£17.50 Desserts £6-£8. Wines from £22. Gilpin Spice is an act of bravery, fashioned from raw wood, vibrant dangling lampshades, tamarind, garlic, ginger, noodles and open guttering flames. Its interest in southeast Asia and, in particular, Desi-Chinese food, a venerable amalgam of Chinese and Indian styles courtesy of Hakka immigration into Kolkata, would be bold down London’s Walworth Road. Here, just a polished stone’s throw from Windermere in the Lake District, it’s almost wilful. Over the past few years, courtesy first of L’Enclume and then Forest Side, Holbeck Ghyll, the Old Stamp House, Lake Road Kitchen and a bunch of others, a Cumbrian food narrative has emerged. Intense chefs no longer merely want to cook your tea, they want to reflect and honour the landscape through their food. They want to rub up against a Herdwick or grapple fish from a babbling brook with their calloused bare hands. Chefs forage relentlessly as if well-managed agriculture were some filthy, brazen intervention by the 17th century. Hard-crusted, unyielding sourdough is always part of the deal, as is cheesy butter which is either whipped or cultured or both. Invariably, dishes are plated up on bits of crockery for which the word “gnarled” was invented. You just know that people who call themselves artisans will have been involved in your lunch. It’s easy to mock, which is obviously why I just did so. In truth the standard Lake District food story has led to both some very good restaurants and food. And that’s the point. This whole schtick has become so established that diverging from it, cooking in vibrant Technicolor as they do at Gilpin Spice, takes what the Mexicans call cojones and I’ll call guts, because I’m well dragged up. The man responsible is Hrishikesh Desai, a one-time Roux Scholarship winner with serious experience both here and in the US. He arrived at Gilpin Hotel and Lake House in 2015 courtesy of an Alex Polizzi BBC TV show which followed the Cunliffe family as they attempted to recruit a new chef for their hotel. The rather fancy Hrishi restaurant came first, and soon picked up a star from a tyre company. The more laid-back Gilpin Spice opened in 2016. On a wintry lunchtime, the flames flickering a deep-orange welcome at the back of the open kitchen, it feels like exactly the right place to be. Outside there are views of snowy peaks; inside there is the promise of hot and sour and of roasted spice, a nod to the historic trade through nearby Whitehaven. The cooking here is determined to hit every one of your yielding sweet spots. We start very much on the Indian side of the menu, with pani puri, the delicate pastry cups filled with chickpea curry, chaat masala and chopped raw onions (visit with a close friend). There is a small and extremely functional jug – just look how well it pours – with which to add a little hot and sour tamarind sauce. These have to go in your gob all in one, regardless of whether that’s your thing or not. It’s a whoosh of crunch, chilli and sweetness. A boisterous puffed rice salad is full of highly spiced nutty things you’ll be happily picking out of your teeth for days to come. There are flaky wedges of flatbread, still warm from the oven. Alongside them for dredging and dipping, there is a tamarind sauce, a tomato chutney and a sugary Thai-style chilli jam. From the list of small plates comes a salad of little gem and pink grapefruit which hits the table with the glorious armpit funk of the fermented fish sauce used in the dressing. It’s both mildly repellent and thoroughly alluring; a plate full of the fresh and the dead. From the more delicate side of the ledger come thick pieces of seared salmon, on a bright yellow sauce of coconut, mustard and turmeric with cubes of pickled root vegetables. It’s all hinged between softness and bite. Smoked mashed potato is pelted with cumin and chilli, formed into cakes, then deep-fried and served on a Thai-inflected chickpea salad, blowsy with pumpkin chutney and dribbled with yogurt spun through ginger. If these descriptions are not making you purse your lips and Google train schedules, then frankly, I despair. Bigger dishes are playful. Southern Indian buttermilk fried turkey demands to be taken seriously. Here come crisply coated bits of bird, on a huge sauce full of star anise and orange zest, alongside candied beetroot. A round of saddleback pork belly is rubbed with five spice and roasted in a wood-fired oven for 12 hours before being finished on the rotisserie. It is served with a big, sticky, honeyed pork jus. It is a plateful fixed somewhere between a slab of Cantonese roasted meat and a fine Cumbrian Sunday roast fed to you by someone who thinks you’re not looking after yourself properly. These are all good things. Against this, a big bold stew of bouncy paneer and sweet onions with handfuls of fresh curry leaves and ginger feels sweetly traditional and Indian. No matter: for carbs we order a big bowl of noodles, dressed with garlic oil, with the smokiness of a hot wok, all of which drags it back from India towards China. (We could have gone so much further along this road: they serve five-spiced duck confit with a damson and plum sauce, to be wrapped up in pancakes.) Desserts are mixed. A set cream claims to be flavoured with cardamom but that’s missing in action, so it’s just solid panna cotta. Much better is a pear poached in red wine, filled with kaffir lime leaf ice-cream and then given a deep lake of warm cinnamon custard to lounge about in like it’s got nothing better to do. Or just soothe the chilli and sugar hit with scoops of sprightly strawberry and Thai basil or yogurt and black pepper sorbets. We are being good people and so are off the booze, but there is an extensive list of teas, served in dinky ceramic pots for top-ups. It’s all extremely civilised and, as long as you have a pronounced sweet tooth, a lot of fun. For locals, who may have had their fill of tweezered platefuls, representing the rugged, sheep-dunged Cumbrian hills, it must be a complete godsend. News bites After eating at the much revered Skosh in York, the founders of the nearby Cooper King Distillery have collaborated with the restaurant to produce a bespoke gin. It includes black cardamom, nori, mandarin zest and Sichuan peppercorns and is designed specifically to complement chef Neil Bentinck’s cooking. It’s being served at Skosh and is also available to buy there (skoshyork.co.uk). Koconut Grove in Chester is an elegant white box of a restaurant, focusing on the food of Kerala, southern India. So, alongside options from the tandoor, there are lots of fabulous lacy dosas, savoury pancakes made from a fermented batter of rice and lentil flour. Do not miss the masala dosa, filled with spiced potatoes and fried onions (koconutgrove.co.uk). The Gingerman group, run by Brighton stalwart chef Ben McKellar, is to open a fifth business in the city, on Hannington’s Lane. Flint House, the first of theirs not to have the word “ginger” in its title, will be a “casual dining” restaurant, based around “small plates”. But of course.

Small plates £9-£13, bigger plates £18-£29, desserts £5-£8. Wines from £24 On the night Flor opened the doors to its sliver of a townhouse by London’s Borough Market, one restaurant writer tweeted indignantly that he hadn’t been able to get a table, despite the website’s claim that they held back space for walk-ins. Well, doh! As Homer might have said in the restaurant critic episode of The Simpsons. Flor wasn’t just any old opening. It wasn’t some witty Peruvian-Greek small plates mashup utilising seasonal produce cooked over logs harvested from Peckham’s Goose Green. It’s the second restaurant from the team behind the high-flying, adored Lyle’s, which has enough awards and citations to make Meryl Streep feel like an underachiever. Chef James Lowe and manager John Ogier may have claimed they were launching an ever so humble bakery-led dining room, for when you feel just a bit peckish. The rest of us were entitled to go, “Whatever, boys.” Accordingly, it has been mobbed by my colleagues who, in fine journalistic tradition, got to the story first. This is me confessing that, while it only opened in July, I am late through the door. It also means I am burdened by high expectations, because so far it has been a chorus of wet-lipped hallelujahs and aerated dribble for the concise menu of idiosyncratic dishes. Where Lyle’s makes a point of Britishness, here they say they are looking deeper into Europe. We can all get behind that, right? The moment you crash through the door it becomes clear this really is an elbows-on-the-table sort of place, not least because there’s nowhere else to put them. On the ground floor there is a high counter around an open kitchen and a few tiny tables at which to sit knee to knee. Waiters are mostly thin. At the back is a corkscrew of black painted metal spiral staircase, which must be a nightmare to negotiate in heels. It leads to another tight space of tiny tables and compact banquettes. The small tables are an issue because it is 2019. Therefore, you will not get something as banal as one plate each at a time. The food comes in whatever order the kitchen deigns, even if there isn’t enough space to place the crockery. It’s a clatter of dishes crammed together, which only adds to the sense of dissonance and discord. Before anybody thinks I’m about to be arsey for the sake of it, be in no doubt: they serve some very good food. I understood some of the attendant noise and hoopla. A tart of sweetly roasted datterini tomatoes, bursting from their skins as if optimistically they bought their clothes a size too small, lies on a rugged purée of violet aubergines. It is dotted with snowy peaks of feta. All of this summery loveliness is encased in a miraculously short, crisp pastry shell. It is a serious looker but, more importantly, eating it quickly justifies the desecration of its beauty. Scarlet prawns come in two parts. The slippery, sticky meat is served raw, dressed with the fragrant citrus and spice kick of orange yuzu kosho. The big fat heads are grilled and served separately for maximum suckage. And then there is the blistered sourdough flatbread laid with garlic and the soft elasticity of Spenwood sheep’s cheese, piled in turn with big fat clams. A clam pizza is a cracking idea, which I would happily meet again. But other things are bizarre or clumsy or, whisper it, just not very nice. Broad salted anchovies laid on toast with a gossamer overcoat of translucent lardo sounds like all the good salty fatty things in one place. But the cured back fat is cut so thickly it’s less a silky shimmer than a duvet. (As ever, you’ll find my picture of this over on Instagram). A heap of salad with a thick brown satay-like dressing of hazelnuts and preserved lemons is simply odd. And then there’s the dish listed as “summer vegetables, sesame”. It turns out to be that old 70s stager crudités. I’ve seen that movie and I know how it so often ends: with a furrowed brow of disappointment. For it to work the vegetables need fire and bite. These are artfully chosen. They are crisp and also exceedingly bland. The bowl of tahini dressing to drag them through is all the silky, deep, lusty tones we expect of tahini. It’s also completely unsuited to the job. This needs acidity, something to make the vegetables more than themselves, but it’s absent. And suddenly the £9 price tag for a plate of veg and a lacklustre dressing feels like the price you pay for eating out in London right now. It simply doesn’t hang together as a meal. It’s a bunch of edible things, corralled together on one piece of paper, with very little to say to one another. A well-written menu should be a matrix that you can plot a route through in any direction, and still come up with something that makes sense. Instead, I feel like I’ve been at a tasting session: here are a few dishes the kitchen is working on. What do you think? Well, I liked the tomato tart and the flatbread, and thank you for having me. It’s the same at dessert. Almond granita with plums and flaked almonds feels like it’s making up the numbers. The brown butter cakes, crisp crust giving way to a sweet syrupy sponge, are a bit of baking with which I could be lifelong friends. And now I’m exhausted and confused. The item that sums it all up is the bread. Lyle’s is famed for its sourdough. The Flor press release proudly announced they’d used the same starter with which they opened Lyle’s five years ago. And yes, the crust is fabulous: both crunchy and tearable. But the crumb is weirdly moist, as if underbaked. I find myself rolling it into a damp ball like I used to do with Mother’s Pride when I was a kid. You should not be able to do that with bread coming out of a kitchen run by James Lowe. Staff are keen, even if they do the “no notebook” thing, which always puts me on edge. Still, it all moves along at a clip. But I leave trying to work out what happened to me. I know this review is what political pollsters call an outlier. It diverges from the consensus. So be it. Sadly, I can’t pretend I think a restaurant made total sense just to be in the popular place on the scatter graph. News bites Like James Lowe of Flor, Lee Tiernan was also the head chef at St John Bread and Wine, though his place, Black Axe Mangal at London’s Highbury Corner, is a very different beast. There’s a graffiti-covered wood-fired oven, and both music and food to rattle your eyeballs. Go for the likes of roasted suckling pig with white beans and sriracha, or their blistered flatbread laid with grilled beef, served rare with a tomato salsa and pickled chilli (blackaxemangal.com). Congratulations to the winners of the Italian Awards, recently announced in Manchester, which recognise Italian restaurants across the country.

Small plates £1.50-£8, large plates £9-£29 (for whole chicken), wines from £25, beers around £5 a pint Down a shadowed road an old man shambles. He’s wearing a secondhand pinstripe jacket and sensible shoes with cushioned soles. Pools of buttercup-yellow light spread from reconditioned railway arches, illuminating the uncreased faces of the Friday-night crew outside, bottles of the finest local microbrew in hand. Music booms. There’s a cavernous bar gilded in red neon with the legend Night Tales. Broad-shouldered bouncers stand sentry, thumbing their phones. The old man shuffles past, aware it’s not for him. I can’t help but feel a little sorry for him. This is because the old man is me. I have come to where the young people are and I feel like David Attenborough in the Galapagos, only with more trepidation and fewer cameras. I know why I am here. I’ve spent the afternoon scanning the menus of restaurants staring you down with starters at £15 and mains at £25 plus and I’m fed up. It feels exclusive. There’s a place for restaurants like that – expense can be justified. But too many of those menus read like a false promise and I’m not in the mood to believe them. So here I am, in Hackney, on what will turn out to be the right side of the tracks, looking for good food, fairly priced. Down in one of these arches is the Hackney Church Brew Co, named after the spire across the road. Not long ago they welcomed chef Elliot Cunningham and his semi-permanent pop-up Lagom. There is a brewery and next to it a huge red-brick arch of a bar area, the ceiling painted black. The floor is fitted with over-engineered refectory-style tables. Like me, they’re all extremely chunky. You order both drinks and food from the counter, the latter coming from a small, smoky open kitchen just behind. That, in turn, looks out on to an urban garden, which makes a virtue of gravel, strings of glowing bulbs overhead and the business end of air-conditioning units. There are picnic tables. Laden waiters wander about looking for the number sign you were given when you ordered. A couple of whippets snooze on a blanket by the kitchen. Twentysomethings, who have probably abandoned all hope of saving to get on the housing ladder because my generation screwed it all up for them, crowd those tables, choosing instead to spend their money here. If all this sounds uncomfortable and noisy and chaotic to you, then by all means stay away. But just be aware you will be missing out on some bold live-fire cooking that throbs uncompromisingly with flavour. I live for a bit of throbbing flavour, me. And because it comes without fripperies – who needs linen or chairs or a full table service? – the price really is decent. Elliot Cunningham is half Swedish and that heritage supplies the word lagom, a term that’s difficult to translate literally, according to the internet. I’m told it means “not too much and not too little” or thereabouts. That describes the very short, simple food offering. Cunningham says he wants to prove that there’s more to cooking over wood fire than just hunks of meat, though he’s exceptionally good at those. A slab of bone-in pork belly is slow-cooked then rubbed with fermented chilli and the sweet sugary hit of liquid jaggery from the kithul palm, before being allowed to wallow in the gentle heat and smoke of the grill. The result is soft, with an encouraging outer crunch. It is a plate of caramelisation and melting fat. It’s an awful lot of top pig action for £10. Sutton Hoo chicken is given the same long and slow treatment, to produce crisp skin and meat that peels away from the bone without being dry, with the high waft of the smoke it has been embraced lovingly by for hours. Tonight, among the specials, there is a smoked beef bun for £8, made with featherblade cooked for 12 hours, rested then slapped with more fermented chilli. So far, so barbecue. It’s the non-meat dishes that are more striking. Golden beetroot is roasted over the coals until soft, then sliced up into something approximating a carpaccio. Those slices are dressed with a fine acidic emulsion punched up with molasses, along with crushed hazelnuts and torn mint leaves. I’ve eaten an awful lot of beetroot over the past few years. I’ve eaten so much of the red variety I’ve had nights when my pee turned pink. This was the best plate of the stuff I have eaten in years. A big serving of closed-cap mushrooms for a fiver are long smoked to an almost meaty intensity and dressed with dollops of boisterous salsa verde; courgettes are grilled and served with chilli, mint and lemon. There is a white coleslaw full of crunch and salt and vinegar, and “crispy” potatoes the colour of polished gold, with undulations and crevices and curled bits. They aren’t just crisp, they are crispy. Each plate is a simple idea, expressed vividly and with care so that the key ingredient gets to shout its name. There is no dessert on the menu today, but at weekends they serve cherry pie. These have already been made in preparation for the rush. And yes, if I ask nicely, they will pop one in the oven. A note of warning: it is a dish with a sugared pastry crust. If you are livid about this being described as a pie because there isn’t pastry all the way round, please write to your MP. They’ve not got much on at the moment. Beneath that toffeed crust is what happens to fresh cherries cooked down in sugar syrup for a long time. On the side is a gravy boat of double cream. The dish is a tenner, and is designed to serve two, even if one of them is me. I drink wine, because I am that bloke, but it’s called the Hackney Church Brew Co, and they have a fine selection of their own IPAs, pilsners and lagers. I walk out of the service road down the side of these reconditioned railway arches, where the generation below me throng, with a proper spring and jump in my step. I went in a tourist. I came out ready to be a regular. News bites Edo in the centre of Belfast also has a smoky, live fire focus to its cooking courtesy of the wood burning Bertha oven at the heart of the kitchen. Much of chef Jonny Elliott’s menu is a robust take on classic tapas: there are croquetas, tortillas and padron peppers. But there are also salt room aged steaks and fish dishes sent for a spin through the intense heat of the apple and pear wood-burning Bertha (edorestaurant.co.uk). Despite a slew of big openings, it’s clear the hospitality business is finding trading tough. The latest casualties are the highly regarded Picture restaurants in London’s Marylebone and Fitzrovia, the second of which I reviewed positively in 2017. The owners have announced their closure, saying the business is no longer viable. Happily, they are doing it the right way, closing the restaurants ‘without leaving anyone out of pocket’. Meanwhile in Ilkley, Simon and Rena Gueller have announced they are looking for a buyer for the Box Tree, which they took over in 2004. It opened in 1962 and was an early point of gastronomic pilgrimage for British restaurant goers, becoming one of the very first places in the UK to be awarded two Michelin stars.

Starters £5.50-£14, mains £16-£30, desserts £6-£10, three courses at lunch £23, wines from £22 Journalists like a story, even those of us paddling in the shallow end in search of something nice for our tea: stories like the Holiday Inn just begging to have its terrible food reviewed, or the Swiss-themed place with the stringy fondue and the bought-in sorbet, or the Kurdish family remembering its own culture one dish at a time. The group of restaurants that has been opened across the northwest of England by chef and restaurateur Gary Usher is meant to be the anti-story. In 2011 when he launched the first, Sticky Walnut in Chester, he went all Royston Vasey and warned the likes of me off. This, he said, was a local bistro for local people. Stay away. When he opened his second restaurant, Burnt Truffle in Heswall on the Wirral, I ignored him. I piled in and, infuriatingly for him, liked it very much. Usher’s restaurants don’t serve ground-breaking food. He’s not attempting to leap boundaries, or draw attention to himself through his deft cooking. He’s just serving up the kind of classy, appealing food you’d like to eat repeatedly, and at a reasonable price. And where the hell is the story in that? Over the past few years, in the face of crass intransigence from the banks, he has used the crowdfunding model to help open a growing group of these neighbourhood bistros that I am not meant to visit. There’s Hispi in Didsbury and Wreckfish in Liverpool and Pinion not far away in Prescot (its opening is the subject of a forthcoming Channel 4 documentary). A few months back he opened Kala in Manchester, after breaking the world record for crowdfunding £100,000 in just 11 hours. Usher may talk down his little neighbourhood bistros, but people seem to love them, and want one of their own. Rightly so. With a trip to Manchester planned, I scan the available possibilities. The city has many of those. But I keep clicking my way back to the menu at Kala. No, there really is nothing extraordinary about any of these dishes. There is no story. Except for the much bigger one, which is this: the health of a restaurant culture is not defined by a baby-handful of glittering temples to gastronomy flogging platefuls of overwrought ambition and memories. It’s defined by places like Kala quietly feeding you well. So here I now am, up the curving staircase from the handsome dark wood bar at the front, to this first-floor space with its polished concrete floor and its emerald green banquettes in leather and velveteen. It has shell- shaped wall lights, an open kitchen and inked and eager waiters. To get started we have a plate of golden crusted focaccia which, just for good measure, has been dribbled with a little extra olive oil to ease everything on its way. At lunchtime, as well as the main menu, there is a shorter version at £20 for two courses and £23 for three. We order from both, though there is no sense of being short-changed in the cheap seats. Both feed us just as well. What defines the cooking is the attention to the essentials. A block of a faultless chicken liver parfait from the set menu arrives pleasingly pink. It is glossed with a little oil and dusted with crystals of salt. “We call that chicken butter,” our waiter says, and I can see why. I slather it on to torn pieces of their brioche, and top it with a smear of their chutney, as if I’m genuinely interested in balancing out the glories of schmaltz. The other starter is a big dollop of snowy burrata, its foetal cheese subtleties pointed up by a dusting of ground walnuts and chilli. Next to it are roasted purple carrots and for crunch, puffed kernels of rice, looking like the insect-eating revolution has begun. Where the parfait feels like an act of classic bourgeois indulgence – stop rolling your eyes; I hear gout is bang on-trend these days – this is a dish for those trying to claim an interest in restraint, despite the big hit of dairy fats. A ridged and rugged leg of crisp-skinned duck confit, a contrast to the one that looked so drearily bought in at that rooftop place a few weeks ago, comes with a mound of a neon orange sweet potato purée. It is soft and velvety. It is a root vegetable transformed into an act of kindness and care. There is a meaty puddle of what I should probably call gravy, this being Manchester, and leaves of baby endive, each one filled with a pokey vinaigrette and sprinkled with chopped chives. It’s a plateful which both makes sense, and is achingly pretty. The nearest to modishness are torched meaty fillets of plaice from the main menu. They come with samphire, brisk cubes of pickled cucumber, deep-fried vinegared anchovies and a chervil sauce, the deep green of a field in winter. Because a positive review is always made by the one, pointed niggle, I shall mention the heavy hand with the salt on the fish, which almost overwhelmed it. I know, Gary, I know; bloody restaurant critics. But take comfort from my deep, intense love for a side dish of charred little gem, sprinkled with deep-fried capers, alongside a big spoonful of a truffled egg yolk emulsion and a serious grating of salty Berkswell cheese across the top. Oh, and the sizeable chips which are really just superb roasties, cut to look like something else. The dessert list laughs in the face of summer. You’re in Manchester and here, they take the sweet end seriously. There’s a fair old brick of glossy parkin, with oats for texture and the warmth and encouragement of ginger, all cooled down by a scoop of crème Chantilly and a puddle of butterscotch sauce. There’s a subtantial choux bun, sliced open and filled with passion fruit cream and passion fruit sorbet, then laid in a pond of a caramelised white chocolate sauce. After that a double espresso is medically required. All this, and as it happens, Usher has form as the kind of employer we need more of. Recently he was on Twitter asking for advice on how to sort out admin for a homeless man to whom he had offered a kitchen job. He opens the restaurants that people want. He serves the kind of food people like to eat. And he’s good to his staff. If only I could work out what the damn story was. News bites Is it too soon to mention The Spärrows again? I do hope not. This extremely small but perfectly formed restaurant in a railway arch close to Manchester Victoria station, interrogates the food of the Tyrol (roughly) and gets all the right answers. Go there for spätzle, those misshapen noodles familiar across the region, with braised onions and cheese. Move on to plates of meat-filled pelmeni or pierogi. Finish with coffee and cake, and then find somewhere for a quiet lie down (thesparrows.me) Major developments within the Corbin &amp; King group, famed for restaurants like the Wolseley and Brasserie Zedel.

Still, here we are, many years later, with the new Central Cross, a gleaming, 48,000 sq ft plaza just off Charing Cross Road. Shanghai Modern is one of Central Cross’s first openings. It is yards from the former Dive Bar beneath the King’s Head pub, which at one stage was one of the West End’s most excellent subterranean hidey-holes. “Call the police, there’s a mad man around,” sang Neil Tennant, immortalising Gerrard Street’s melee: a glut of Cantonese, Sichuan and Hunan restaurants, plus a rolling cast of tipsy gays, Wag clubbers, glamour studio girls, OAP mahjong leagues and jobbing sari seamstresses. Central Cross, on the other hand, is more about fresh cement and attracting tourist footfall, but then, all regeneration is tricky. Some will say that Shanghai Modern and its new neighbour JinLi are exactly the kind of Instagram-pretty, future-facing, 150-seat projects that Chinatown needs right now. Give the ’Grammers their soft-shell crab perched on a tropical island of mango fried rice and their signature novelty, pastel-pink-coloured pork xiao long bao with adorable ears and snout. Give them their front display kitchen to focus a zoom lens up a chef’s nose as he crimps the dough. Other onlookers might ask how bigger, better, brighter Chinatown hopes to survive when “fishing raids” by immigration have become so “violent”, according to the London Chinatown Chinese Association, that last July there was a mass restaurant shutdown in protest. What Shanghai Modern definitely – yes, definitely – is: it is marginally nicer to hang around in than Din Tai Fung. That Taiwanese behemoth opened last year serving xiao long bao to considerable hype, despite it feeling like the inside of a cavernous cruise ship that has been stripped down for parts. Din Tai Fung makes its dumpling technicians toil solemnly in a glass box, whereas Shanghai Modern lets them breathe fresh air. There’s also a pretty, shiny, chessboard floor and vaguely comfortable seats. The welcome may be brusque – don’t expect anything as over the top as eye contact – yet, on the bright side, you will quickly hold a vast shopping list of dumplings, wonton noodles, Sichuan broths and “Chinese tapas” (their words), plus a pen. Tick your list and hand back the slip. Do not, repeat, do not doodle on your order, or let your bored child deface it. (I enjoyed one glorious customer review where this occurred and let’s say it did not end well). On our visit, dishes began arriving almost instantly, first a bowl of steamed but now cold okra with a snotty trail of fierce wasabi and soy, more cleansing and saintly than delicious, but a pleasing start. Drunken chicken wings in rice wine were pale and decidedly sober, but next came a real highlight: roasted bran dough with assorted fungus, a magical, slightly gothic-looking bowl of dank sponginess. Similar to seiten (not Satan), bran dough is the hinterland between tofu and the heel of a Warburtons thick wholemeal loaf. It is an umami Hoover. I am a convert. Next along, baskets of pan-fried beef Shanghai buns and vegetable dumplings, both neatly made, both yielding, and with bags of seasoning and colour on the correct surfaces. By this point, we were already plotting to come back. Shanghai Modern may not be life-changing, but in some ways it’s comforting that, after all the developers’ intentions to flatten, rebuild and reinvent the wheel, these owners have unveiled something that’s, at best, simply reliable and wouldn’t have set the world alight in 1988. There is no shame in this. If you want fireworks, however, I recommend the ebulliently numbing Sichuan fish broth, which appears in a huge tureen, gorgeous, vivid red and brimming with peppers. It would feed four, at least. I wildly misjudged how much food we needed, and by this point the staff were sighing while pulling up adjoining tables to host our dishes. I’d have been more sheepish if I could feel anything from the ears downwards. The much-talked-about soft-shell crab on top of mango fried rice is actually rather pretty. Naff, but pretty. If you ask them for the sweet red bean xiao long bao, they’ll bring a warm basket of nine, pristine gob-fillers stuffed with an irresistible, salty-sweet, burgundy sludge. The bill arrived in 11 seconds. Shanghai Modern continues the rich, four-decade-long Chinatown tradition of serving decent, fairly priced, unsentimentally served meals.

Before I could deliver this sparkling prose on Sabai Sabai, for example, I had to retrieve the crumpled receipt from the bottom of my handbag as an aide-memoire: “£95.35 total without service,” it read. So I had, in fact, definitely been there, for about 90 minutes one recent Saturday lunchtime. The receipt also revealed that I had tried several appetisers and main courses, pandan-flavoured pancakes for pudding and a martini. Still, my memories of the place are muted. Sabai Sabai is the fourth, and most ambitious, opening in an apparently award-winning chain of Thai restaurants in the Birmingham environs: Harborne, Moseley and, about 40 miles away, Stratford-upon-Avon. This latest opening is slap-bang in Birmingham central, and a quick scoot around its website and local media plaudits position it as breathtakingly glamorous, as well as apparently being an authentic taste of Thailand. I called Charles, who ate with me, but he also had restaurant amnesia. “The noisy one inside an insurance building with the big cocktail bar, remember?” I prompted. He still wasn’t sure. “The one with those weird pancakes full of desiccated coconut that stuck around our teeth. It was a bit like a Revolution vodka house, but they served laab bet.” I expect none of these comments to reach Sabai Sabai’s PR literature. A challenge facing anyone opening an exciting, modern Thai restaurant these days is to gauge what type of “modern” they’re aiming for. Thai, of all the foreign cuisines to be taken to British hearts over recent decades, is currently in the midst of a grand reimagining. It’s out with the pad thais and fishcakes, the little saucers of dips, the framed posters of the Phi Phi islands, the batik wall hangings and the sounds of Chiang Mai pop star Pongsak Rattanapong mewling plaintively through Life Is Not A Fairytale. Instead, it’s in with the roasted pak ka na (Thai kale), brown crab kruang gaeng, loud and rare Skip Spence solo material on vinyl, muted cafe decor, red wine pairings, no reservations and queues out of the door. Let’s call it Hipster Thai 2.0: London Edition. In the midst of all this, we also have places such as Nonya in Glasgow serving a Thai-Malay-Chinese mashup to the soothing sounds of German deep house like Andhim, although that shut down very abruptly last week. Sabai Sabai, after some mulling, began to re-emerge in my mind. It is mostly old-school Thai, pitching for a bit of the new stuff and ending up more like a fancy chain bar that serves Thai-style martinis and dragon punch alongside chicken satay gai, kanom jeeb chicken and prawn dumplings and deep-fat fryer favourites such as prawn toong tong, or “golden bags”, and spring rolls. My lychee martini was a watery glass of teeth-chattering sweetness with a lychee garnish, and was the kind of thing that would have thrilled the turnout at M People’s Elegant Slumming album launch. That Saturday lunchtime, the place was relatively busy, with tables full of the sort of civilised, post-youth friendship groups who once caned it all weekend, but who now meet for double dates to nod amicably at each other’s pictures of tier-on-tier shutters. Service was quite prompt. Or at least it was until one particular set of waiters finished their shift just after our appetisers – the aforementioned toong tong and kanom jeeb, same fillings twice, one fried – and then went outside for a ciggie. This resulted in one of those handover periods, in which there was no one on the floor at all, making me feel like staging a coup and shouting, “I’m the captain now.” Kao pode tord – long, lumpy sweetcorn fritters on skewers – were actually rather glorious, and that laab bet (minced duck salad), although rather one-tone, did display evidence of lime and chilli. A bowl of prawn geng bha jungle curry was perfectly acceptable, with a clear broth that had a definite heat, veg and krachai, although we were now in £14-a-dish territory with a side of nondescript sticky rice at £3.95 on top. We ordered vegetarian pad see ew noodles to see if any great effort would be given to making this collision of tofu, udon and mangetout and carrot delicious. Spoiler alert: there wasn’t. My strongest memory of Sabai Sabai was getting the bill, after the pancakes and via persistence, and realising there was no service charge added. I emptied my purse of pound coins anyway, feeling there must be someone, somewhere, in the place who deserved it. So the whole lot cost around a hundred pounds. You can’t buy memories like that. • Sabai Sabai 7 Waterloo Street, Birmingham B2, 0121-448 3850. Open all week, noon-11pm (10.30pm Sun). About £35 a head, plus drinks and service.

Starters £9-£12, mains £14-£32.50, desserts £8-£12, wines from £27 The moment I’d paid the bill at the Bourne &amp; Hollingsworth Garden Room atop the Assembly Hotel, I took the lift down 10 floors and lolloped up London’s Charing Cross Road in a blind, pigeon-toed fury. I went to the Ivy Club, the shiny members’ space above the theatreland restaurant of which it is a part. Yes, I’m a member. So shoot me. They mix a killer whiskey sour, there’s an impressive live jazz scene and they have a no-photography rule that means I can get drunk and slip off a bar stool like treacle spilling from its tin, and no one will have pictorial evidence. This evening I wasn’t there for the jazz or the inebriation. Even though I’d already had three courses, I wanted an Ivy dessert; one so famous that, despite, being off menu, it’s still a big seller. The kitchen at the Garden Room had taken the classy idea of that dessert and committed the culinary equivalent of grievous bodily harm upon it. They had kneed it in the metaphorical knackers and laughed in its face before serving it to me like it was an entirely reasonable thing to do. I wanted to be reminded just how good the real thing is, and how bad that one had been. I wanted to nurse my anger. I just wish it had been the only sin committed against good taste and good manners that evening. It wasn’t. As ever I had expected so much more. This is because I’m a fool. Bourne &amp; Hollingsworth is a self-styled “creative lifestyle company”. They “curate beautiful spaces”. They run brasseries and bars and pop-ups and “happenings”. They admit they “aren’t for everyone,” which is certainly true. Based on this meal, they are not for me. A few months back they took over the top floor of the Assembly, which is one of those bare-bones hotels where they make you use your room card to access the lifts so you feel secure. Only the 10th floor is available to the public. Normally, I stick to a mantra: never eat in a restaurant that is on a boat, that turns or has a view because it won’t ever be about the food. But B&amp;H talks a good game, and I adore London’s roof tops, those unexpected views of hidden terraces; of windows turned to the sky; of skyscrapers piercing the clouds and, in the distance, the place where the city gives way to the country. The Garden Room view really is spectacular and on a summer’s evening, as the sun dips behind the capital’s glass cliff faces, it feels like a special place to be. Then the nice waiters start bringing the terrible food. It is a brutal exercise in portion control and failed staff motivation. I genuinely don’t think the kitchen wants to be this clumsy and graceless; I just suspect they’ve been given no particular reason to do otherwise. We start with king prawn and chestnut mushroom skewers with béarnaise sauce, which bring to mind the old Jewish joke: “Oi, the food is awful, and the portions, so small.” For £10.50 you get four tough and underseasoned prawns and three flabby and undercooked mushrooms. Weirdly, the béarnaise seems to have wandered in from another kitchen; one where someone cares. It’s thick and frothy and rich with fresh tarragon. There is only one way to deal with this trauma. Order the crispy kale salad. The new trauma will deaden the old. The crispy bits appear to have been deep-fried a long time before we made the mistake of coming. They are cold and leak vegetable oil into your mouth as you bite in. There are also soggy leaves of undressed, steamed kale; thuds of green matter, waiting to be composted. Occasionally you uncover a piece of roasted carrot that is mildly pleasant. There are nuts which, like my hopes and dreams, are crushed. It costs £10. The menu is the equivalent of eager dad dancing. It’s attempting to find the cultural pulse without ever understanding the things it’s trying to do. Just putting pomegranate seeds on to a roasted cauliflower salad does not make you Yotam Ottolenghi, especially if the vegetable is barely coloured. It looks like once-boiled cauliflower that’s been resting in the back of a fridge, perhaps in a recycled ice-cream tub, looking for a purpose. It’s the sort of dish you knock up for your offspring’s new vegan partner because you don’t like them very much. It costs £14. Add a meagre portion of cotton wool chicken and you’ll be paying £19 for the word dismal. The best dish of the night is a leg of duck confit, with an overcooked celeriac and potato gratin and a tooth-achingly sweet cherry sauce. It’s food fit for a banquet. By which I mean the banqueting suite of a regional ring-road hotel where they’re handing out awards for innovation in quantity surveying. And so to dessert, because this restaurant reviewing lark is a job not a jolly and I have to eat things I don’t like. There is a chocolate marquise, which has completely split. They’ve attempted to disguise this by smoothing over the disc of set chocolate with a hot palette knife, but spoon inside and it’s grainy, like furiously overwhipped cream. The other dessert, the one which sent me running up the Charing Cross Road, is listed as iced berries with white chocolate sauce. The version served to me at Ivy HQ, where it first became famous decades ago, is exactly as it should be: a large plate spread tightly with frozen fruit. A modest amount of hot, white chocolate sauce is then poured on at the table. It’s sweet and sour and crunch and burst and hot and cold and clever. Here, it’s a deep bowl of cloying white chocolate soup, bobbing sparsely with abandoned berries which have lost their chill and are drowning. It’s a dish seemingly prepared by someone who has never met the original. It makes me cross. As, by now, does the scuffed white faux-wooden floor, and the grubby beige linen arms to the chairs, and the treatment of the other diners, who will probably spend £60 a head here and deserve so much more than just the view. I pay. I punch the lift buttons and head to my fancy members’ club. Most of the time it’s an extravagance. Most of the time it’s where I kick back. Tonight, with a spoonful of perfect iced berries and white chocolate sauce in my hand, it’s a place of safety. News bites Not far away from the Assembly on Leicester Square is another budget hotel with a rooftop bar which is worth the effort, because they’ve kept the offering simple. The LSQ Rooftop, at the Indigo Hotel on the north side of the square, has a pleasing menu of small plates, mostly priced around £8: sautéed mini chorizo sausages, fried buttermilk chicken, king prawns with chilli and so on. All that, solid cocktails and a great view too (lsqrooftop.com). Former Professional Masterchef runner-up Matt Healy, whose Leeds restaurant I very much enjoyed recently, has taken over a pub just outside the city. The menu at the Beehive in Thorner. includes their own pork pies, corned beef and haslet, alongside more restless dishes including linguine with lobster broth, mussels and clams, and tiger prawns with Asian salad and dipping sauces (mhbeehive.co.uk). Dishoom, the Bombay-inspired small restaurant group, with five outlets in London plus one each in Manchester and Edinburgh, has a new baby: its own cookbook.

All dishes £4-£12; wines from £24 The best restaurants have a cracking narrative at their heart; a story that nourishes the soul as well as the belly. The narrative behind the newly opened Nandine in Camberwell, south London, is utterly compelling. It is what us old hacks call a good yarn. The headlines are strong enough: Nandine is a simple café, all plywood and painted brick walls, knocking out huge plates of big-flavoured Kurdish food at the sort of prices that restore your faith not just in eating out, but quite possibly in humanity in general. Every plate is a vivid rush of saturated tones, worthy of Technicolor in its pomp. Colours like that promise flavour; the promise is not broken. Behind those headlines is an ancient story: of displacement by war, of immigration and the refreshing of memory and identity through cooking. It belongs to the Baban family, led by the matriarch, Pary. In 1989, then in her late teens, she was forced to leave her home in Qaladze, in what is today Iraqi Kurdistan, when it was attacked by Saddam Hussein’s forces. As she explained to Vice last year, Pary went in search of safety, travelling from village to village and picking up recipes as she went, noting the regional differences in a journal that she retains to this day. Some villages flavoured their food with wild herbs yanked from the rough, stony ground. Others roasted large cuts of lamb. Kurdish food may feel familiar to those who think they know their Turkish or Middle Eastern dishes, but there can be ingredients like dill or celery that are unexpected. Rosewaters play their part. It’s all good. Pary met her husband Pola while travelling across Kurdistan. In 1995 they settled in south London’s Elephant and Castle where, for many years, they ran a newsagent’s. Soon they had a kiosk, offering sandwiches, filled with the likes of stir-fried spiced spinach. The punters appreciated them. That led the family to take over their first space on Vestry Road in Camberwell, which was originally meant for sandwich prep but soon became a café. Pary’s baklava became a talking point. Soon they were invited to open a concession at the Peckham Levels food market. And now they have this small restaurant seating just three dozen, called Nandine, which means kitchen in Kurdish. It is a family business. Pary’s boys Rang and Raman also work across the group. But there is the feeling of a broader familial enterprise; of a bunch of people determined to bring a more obscure strand of regional cooking to an eager, cosmopolitan south London crowd. We visit on a Sunday lunchtime, as brunch gives way to a few dishes off the main menu. It’s too early for booze for me, so they leave the gin out of a pomegranate and sumac G&amp;T. It’s a sparkling candy pink colour and both sweet and sour, and just slightly salty in the right way. We have a set of mezze dips: of hummus, made sprightly and bright by the addition of lime, then dressed with olive oil and sprinkled with white and black sesame seeds; of yogurt and tahini with the fresh crunch of diced cucumber, with a crown of salty capers and a purple dusting with the citrus burst of sumac; of sweet and smoky red pepper purée, the colour of rust, with shining beads of pomegranate. On the side are warm pieces of lightly oiled, spice-dusted and quilted flatbreads, with which to pull and dredge. It is an extremely diverting plateful for just £5.50. From the brunch menu comes a shakshuka of long-cooked tomatoes, onions and spices, with baked eggs, their yolks still runny and, on the side, pieces of crisp-crusted, springy bread baked at their other site. The most expensive dish today, at a mighty £12, is the lula kebab, of boldly spiced minced lamb, but that money gets you a trayful. The two thick slabs of charred and seared minced meat are laid on more flatbread into which, generously, they leak their juices. To one side are pieces of grilled onion, tomato and green pepper. There is a dish of a yogurt dip with, in the middle, some bright yellow pickled cauliflower, which is on more than friendly nodding terms with piccalilli. Up from that is another dish with, at one end, a robustly dressed onion and tomato salad, and, at the other, pickled red cabbage full of vigorous crunch and bite. There is a dusting of sumac and what I take to be za’atar as well as chopped green herbs. The same accessories turn up with pieces of “7 spice” chicken shish, rendered a bright shade of yellow by their marinade. If I was any cop as a journalist, I’d have asked for a list of all seven. Instead, I was too involved in eating it. Too often grilled pieces of breast like this are dry enough to lodge in your throat; this is tender and crisp. It is a better end for the chicken. In the spirit of enquiry and, of course, pure greed, we have ordered too much. Our waiter tells us that in the evenings the best thing to do is come in a group of six and order the entire menu. “It will work out at about £12 to £14 a head,” he says. The point is that we do not have space to finish or even really begin the baharat fries. Instead we stare at what must be one of the prettiest bowls of chips in Britain, dusted with spice, then dressed with a little purple-tinged yogurt, pomegranate and sesame seeds, and more chopped herbs. We do, however, have space for Pary’s famed baklava; for fragile crowns of crisp pastry, filled with crushed nuts and drenched in sugar syrup and made fragrant by the application of dried rose petals and attention to detail. Like everything here, first you look at it and sigh. Then you taste it, and sigh again. Another dessert of an unsweetened coconut milk cream has an odd, jelly-like texture, but makes sense once you get some of the spun sugar from the top, and the baklava from the bottom. And with the last scoop of the spoon, we are in love. Pary has made a long journey of so many kinds to get to this point. She has told us her story through the food on the plate. And we are all the richer for it. News bites Nandine does indeed mean Kitchen in Kurdish. It’s a blunt name for a restaurant but it works, both in Camberwell and Inverness. The Kitchen Restaurant, in a modernist town house overlooking the city’s river, is a buzzy bistro with cheery, encouraging food. Try the cod and smoked applewood cheese fishcakes, the seared chicken with haggis bon bons and make sure to ask whether the general manager has made one of her glorious cheesecakes for dessert (kitchenrestaurant.co.uk). There’s failed restaurant hygiene inspections, and then there’s what happened to a Gloucestershire Pizza restaurant. During a November 2018 inspection a rat ran over the inspector’s foot. Recently they were fined nearly £2000 for offences under food safety legislation. Coincidentally, The Caterer magazine, which reported the story, has just relaunched its diary column. Its name: Kitchen Rat. Wahaca, the Mexican restaurant chain, which faced a PR disaster recently when diners took to social media to berate the company for apparently making a waiter cover part of the bill of a table that had done a runner, has a new plan to tackle staffing issues. They’ve set up a confidential phone line so staff can leave anonymous messages for co-founder Mark Selby about company practises.

Starters £9.50-£11; mains £25-£29; desserts £9.50; wines from £25 Repetition leads, inevitably, to expectation. I have sat at so many tables, being told so often that this particular establishment has a whole small sharing plate thing going on, as if they’d decided to make wheels round rather than irritatingly square, that I now assume this is what a restaurant meal is: a parade of small things, which diners must fight over passive-aggressively, in a desperate attempt to get an equal cut. With this week’s restaurant the clue was in the name. It’s called Grazing by Mark Greenaway and comes complete with a mission statement wrapped around the menu. It declares that “the grazing concept has been a long-held ambition” of the chef, which leads me to mutter under my breath about aiming low. We are invited to “relax, unwind and graze”. But hang on: what’s this? The menu lists arcane things called “starters” and “main courses”. The only dishes specifically designed for sharing are, going by their price tag, ginormous. A shepherd’s pie is £32. Roast monkfish is £58. Obviously you could order anything you like, demand they all be delivered at once, and then go snout down in them, sans cutlery, like a ruminant hitting the cud. That would be a form of grazing. It would also be extremely unattractive. Instead, I suggest you ignore all the marketing guff and recognise this place for what it is: a serious, sweetly traditional restaurant, serving very clever but still gutsy food, at significant prices, in laid-back surroundings. If you need somewhere to celebrate an impending graduation in Edinburgh, book here. It would be unfair to describe Greenaway as a little-known chef. He’s had his awards and his TV appearances, and published a cook book. But in Edinburgh his name has sometimes been overshadowed by those of Tom Kitchin and Martin Wishart. It shouldn’t be so. Recently, Greenaway moved out of his eponymous restaurant to this set of interlocking spaces off the ground-floor atrium of the Waldorf Astoria Caledonian. As with so many hotel restaurants it’s a walk to get to the action, through two other huge dining rooms, which could be filled, but aren’t. Think of it as a way of getting your Fitbit steps in, to mitigate the heft of what is to come. The third space is full of solid tables, the obligatory outbreak of tartan and lots of dark wood. Those deep shades are matched by the still-warm treacle and stout sourdough, the colour of an old leather sofa, with “duck skin” butter. It’s bread and butter, but engineered for the Marvel Universe. It’s full of deep, lusty caramel tones and the butter takes to it, as if to a welcoming lover’s bed. It’s superpowered and so irresistible I eventually have to get it taken away. The menu writing pulls the under-utilised trick of not telling you everything. Compressed discs of deeply piggy ham hock (or “hough”, as here) served at room temperature, do indeed come with the advertised fried quail’s egg and a fanned slice of dehydrated pineapple, the sharpness of which does bring something to the plate. But what makes it is the sizeable dollop of a foamy pea mousse. It turns the dish into a giggly take on pea and ham soup. The cleverness does not overwhelm its more obvious appeal, which is just how fun it is to eat. Another starter of a fried duck egg, laid at the bottom of a dish like a picnic rug, is covered with fragments of warm confit duck, slices of duck “ham” and unexpected dollops of a bright parsley mayo. To show willing we order a third starter of a still-warm crumpet, heaped with curls of cured trout and with salmon roe. In the middle is yet another egg, this time poached. The repeated eggs in these starters was not intentional on our part, but as each one was perfectly cooked, the yolk ready to run in all the right directions, I’m not going to complain. The simplest of the dishes is a square of pork belly, slowly rendered over half a day, with crackling like glass, a “toffee apple” sauce, a few greens and a big welcoming pillow of mash. It’s meat and two veg that’s had a facial, its nails done and a full blow-dry. It is drop-dead gorgeous. Even so, it is overshadowed by a sensitively cooked hake fillet, the skin crisped and given a spritz of acidity. Alongside is a shellfish boudin, wrapped in a roll of striped and silky pasta. The whole dish is brought together by a ripe bisque that tastes of the best of shells that have been roasted down to their essence, then lifted from their sticking place by a glug of booze. Simmer all that, strain, reduce again, then bolster with cream. And hurrah: a sauce that puts the headrush into lush. Even the two side dishes deserve note: golden rustling pieces of “Kentucky-fried” cauliflower (the filthy bastards) and the pop of fresh peas and little gem lettuce bound by a bacony cream sauce. After all that take the hotel-length trudge to the loos. You’ll need the exercise. Because trust me: here, you won’t graze. You’ll trough. A mixed plate of desserts provides the only head scratcher. A halved doughnut is decorated with bits of fresh strawberry and dollops of white and dark chocolate mousse, and simply isn’t as nice as a freshly made, filled doughnut would have been. Fluffy, diminutive buttermilk pancakes, served warm with syrup, are much better. But the winner is a brown sugar cheesecake with a florentine base. We sigh and fight each other for the last scraps even though we are completely stuffed. With an espresso comes expertly tempered salted caramel mini-chocolate bars. This is smart, ambitious but not overwrought food, made by a kitchen which is more interested in your pleasure than showing off. Which, at just north of a tenner for starters, and nearly £30 for mains, is as it should be. (There’s also a bunch of pricey steaks plus a list of cheaper “classics” clearly aimed at those staying at the hotel for longer.) Service was cheery. It was delivered by a chap who told us he’d arrived from Budapest a few months ago and liked it here because the people in Edinburgh were very friendly. We didn’t ask him for any of this information, but he volunteered it quickly by way of a greeting. He was a delightful ornament, to what became a stupendous meal. News bites Henry Scott’s restaurant in Bath is another great place where the chef is more than happy to put his name above the door, and with good reason. It is a very lovely, small independent, knocking out extremely pleasing food. Try the confit chicken ravioli with garlic purée and broccoli tops to start, followed by the roast duck with savoy cabbage and roast fig. Finish with a warm chocolate tart with Szechuan custard. There’s also an entirely vegan menu (henrysrestaurantbath.com). With so many restaurants closing for dismal reasons, it’s worth celebrating one shutting up shop just because the time has come. After 18 years, Peter Gordon and Michael McGrath’s Providores and Tapa Room in London’s Marylebone will serve its last diners in July. In a statement the owners said they wanted to ‘travel and relax after working our socks off’ and that they were ‘going out on a high’. Pret a Manger, which has just swallowed up the 94-strong rival Eat group has announced plans to turn ‘as many as possible’ of the new acquisitions, into vegetarian-only branches. Until now Pret had trialled the vegetarian-only model at just four sites.

Skewers £1.40 - £5.50. Starters £5.50 - £7.50. Main dishes £8.80 -£18. BBQ minimum spend £35 I come across the restaurants I review in many different ways: through sniffing the smoke-cured air in city streets, or stopping hopefully in front of menus in windows; through clicking bravely on links fired at me in emails and scanning press releases for words of promise. I came across Seveni, opposite the Imperial War Museum in south London, because I drove past it at night and it looked bonkers. It occupies a one-storey, many-sided space at the bottom of a neo-brutalist tower block like some geological outcrop. Through the plateglass windows can be glimpsed a low ceiling hung with twinkling, white Club Tropicana fairy lights. A series of hoses of the sort Noo-Noo had for a nose in Teletubbies appear to dangle from the edges of the ceiling. For a while this space was occupied by a Turkish restaurant to which, I admit, I paid little attention. Now, a web search told me, it has been taken over by a Chinese restaurant with a four-pronged approach. For the most part the kitchen interrogates the food of the country’s northeast and comes back with very good answers: that’s barbecue, things on skewers, Sichuan dishes and hotpot (which they ascribe to Beijing). The menu, when viewed online, is a cacophony of small print and “look over here” sections. There’s a very long list of those things on skewers, including beef tendon, aorta, tongue and tripe. There is chicken heart and chicken bone, pork intestine and lamb brain. Choose wisely and you could put together your own skewered cockentrice. I have no idea what “back straps” are and didn’t ask. Items K50 and K51 are in Chinese with no translation. I’m meant to be cross about this outbreak of exclusiveness, but I already knew there were things described in a language I did understand, that I wasn’t going near. Getting bolshie about things in a language I didn’t understand would be silly. That said, going to Seveni without a sense of adventure is missing the point. You even get to cross a tiny wooden fairytale bridge as you enter the dining room. Under that ceiling of fairy lights. It’s like the Singing Ringing Tree, only with an awful lot more chilli and less German. (Stop looking baffled; search YouTube. You’ll thank me.) Mostly, I advise you to go as I did: mob-handed, because if there’s only two or three of you at the table, you’ll struggle to order enough to make sense of the possibilities. And make sure to book one of the BBQ tables, over which hang those Noo-Noo hoses to suck up the smoke. Thrillingly, instead of the usual electric hot plate, the barbecues are powered by cauldrons of burning charcoal, delivered gingerly to the table. There is a minimum charge of £35 per barbecue pit, but that gets you a lot. We used two for the nine of us. Frankly it’s all as larky and boisterous inside as it looks from the outside. Most of the tables are filled with Chinese groups. We’re meant to nod sagely at this, but it’s not necessarily a good sign. Sometimes people just like the comfort of crowds. I can point you at terrible Chinese restaurants full of delighted Chinese people. But the ones here do know what to do with all the kit and, given the fun we ended up having, I’d say following this crowd is a good idea. On one table there’s a metre-high transparent cylinder with a tap for dispensing tea. On another, there’s a device which fits over the barbecue pit, which we’re told is to knock up a kind of omelette. A third table is lost behind a hotpot’s cloud of steam: chicken stock one side, something spicier the other. I attempt to fashion from the menu a sequence in which the dishes should arrive. The waiter smiles sweetly and agrees to my plan. The kitchen then just throws everything at us. Don’t worry. The raw platters for the barbecue can sit on a little wooden trolley at the end of the table, awaiting their moment. What defines the experience is a vibrant, rust-coloured spice mix of cumin, ground chilli, salt and sugar. It’s what stops the barbecue from mimicking the Korean variety and geographically places it elsewhere. Hot nuggets of skewered lamb arrive pelted with it, as do sizeable, butterflied king prawns. It’s even on cylinders of rice cake, which look like those bungs of polystyrene used to protect fragile goods in transit. They take a char nicely and bounce pleasingly between the teeth. I am intrigued by how they might get lambs’ brains on to a skewer without them falling apart, so place an order. They don’t get them on to a skewer. The nuggets turn up in a chilli broth with bamboo shoots, looking exactly like pieces of brain. They are soft and soothing. For the barbecue we have platters of king oyster and enoki mushroom, the strands curling in the heat. There are corn cobs and more rice cakes. This cookery works just as well for non-meat items as it does for the animal. There are ovals of rib eye and scored pieces of pre-seasoned pork belly just waiting to be seared. We pull at our skewers, play with the barbecue and sprinkle on the glorious, uncompromising fairy dust of chilli and cumin. From the Sichuan menu we get fragments of deep-fried chicken, hidden in a heap of red chillies, which provide an earthiness rather than just heat. You get to go on a treasure hunt in search of prime bird. There is quick-fried pig kidney in a mess of sauce and strands of shredded potato, still with a little bite, with yet more dried chillies. There is a dish described as stir-fried Chinese chive with egg. In truth it’s the other way round, which is to say a big, billowy plate piled with the most savoury of herb-flecked scrambled eggs. It’s a breakfast dish for someone in need of a wake-up. Only thick squid tentacles, in another of those big, slumpy red-brown chilli sauces, doesn’t do it for us. It’s all just a bit rubbery. But mostly it’s just an awful lot of noisy, elbows-out, “Pass-me-a-napkin”, “Yes-I’ll-have-another-beer”, “What-the-hell-is-that?”, “Don’t-eat-the-chilies”, “Who-wants-to-try-the-lambs’-brains?” fun. I won’t pretend. That view from the outside is seriously intimidating. It’s reasonable to stare through those windows and wonder whether you’ll ever fit in. I advise you to be brave and walk through the door. News bites Blackpool’s Wok Inn Seaside Noodle Bar draws on the Cantonese tradition that’s dominated Britain’s Chinese restaurants for decades; their glazed spare ribs are glorious. But there’s much more to thrill here from across Asia. Try the beef rendang, the massaman and, in particular, the flaky roti canai that come with them. Do try the salt and chilli duck tongues, too (michaelwanswokinn.co.uk). A new restaurant crowdfunder has launched on Kickstarter, courtesy of Christian Stevenson, the Youtuber AKA DJ BBQ.

However, in recent months, the glitzy, spectacular Zela has taken root in the ground floor of the ME hotel in Aldwych, London. You may remember that I visited Pep Guardiola’s three-storey, Catalonian molecular gastronomy experience, Tast, in Manchester a month or so back. Well, in a similar vein, yet stranger still, Ronaldo has joined with tennis star Rafael Nadal and crooner Enrique Iglesias to chuck so much money at a restaurant that they claim to have invented an entirely new cuisine. Zela, they say, is considered to be the first and best exponent of “Meppon” cuisine – an exquisite, original fusion of the best Mediterranean produce with Japanese techniques. Not since Lord Percy in Blackadder II invented the precious metal “green” have I enjoyed such bold, pioneering spirit. You want gnocchi with your miso halibut? You got it. How about almonds with your tuna tataki? Not a problem, friend. Pull up a chair, tie on a bib.These incredibly rich men – a footballer, a tennis player and a popstar – are reinventing the wheel, and we are truly honoured to be allowed behind the velvet rope to eat tiny plates of wagyu tataki with ponzu sauce at £28 a throw. “But you can’t just invent a cuisine,” you may be shouting. “You can’t just bung the dining culture of Japan into a blender with 20 or so other sovereign countries of southern Europe and the Levant, and then invent the name ‘Meppon’ – which, by the way, sounds like a cat trying to self-regulate fur balls.” To which I would reply: sweetie, these people are very rich, and they can do whatever they want. What a Meppon restaurant actually describes is exactly the sort of joint in a Fast &amp; Furious movie where top-brass baddies go to discuss business with their slinky model molls in alligator-skin pelmet skirts. A DJ booth pumps out loud tribal house, becoming incrementally louder every 20 minutes. There’s toro tartare, Nobu-influenced white fish tiradito, salmon poké and many other raw things flecked with caviar or truffle. There’s living greenery everywhere, bursting from walls, in the window seating and around the bar, leading tourists to stand and take photos through the glass as you eat. Oddly, for all the millions spent, Zela feels exactly like the West End hell portal Rainforest Cafe. Still, the man at the next table is having a smashing time. He’s with a lovely young lady in thigh-length PVC boots and they’re eating usuzukuri toro served on the same plate as pan con tomate and enjoying the thumping electro world music. Who am I to say this isn’t fun? Service begins effusively and mob-handed with at least six people serving us, slipping within 30 minutes to no one serving at all, and eventually to us cancelling pudding. We order the white fish tiradito, which is Peruvian, and served “malagueño style”. It is a pretty plate of sashimi halibut rolled around a tiny, drab cube of potato. It tastes of very little. I’m expecting a hint of chilli or yuzu, perhaps. Nothing. I can’t even taste the potato. Charles has a fine de claire oyster. It arrives in a bowl of ice, swamped in ponzu sauce and lit underneath by its own battery-operated tealight. A basket of three shrimp “al ajillo” gyoza, for £14, have semi-raw skins. A roll of toro uramaki looks like a crime scene: the fatty belly tuna is roughly, unevenly hand-chopped and the outer casing of rice is falling apart – the standard of sushi rolling is sleeker at the Sushi Daily stand in Waitrose. Some fried rice arrives with a semi-cooked “onsen tamago” egg. The white is how it should be: silky and custard-like. The rice is truffle-infused, slightly bitter and certainly oily. By this stage, at our table at least, hope has depleted of getting a decent dinner. We settle instead on a memorable one, watching cocktails being delivered under cloches brimming with dry ice and bickering over whether bongos have ever added anything to house music. And pondering why the kitchen would add such large, tough, dumpling-style lumps to a bowl of delicate miso halibut. Clearly, Meppon cuisine, still very much in its infancy, is going through teething problems. Perhaps, like British cuisine, it will take time to earn respect on the world stage. Give me a call in 600 years and I’ll have another try with the gnocchi. • Zela ME London Hotel, 336-337 Strand, London WC2, 020-8089 3981. Open all week, noon-3pm, 5-11pm (10.30pm Sun).

Starters £9-£21; mains £23-£50; desserts £8-£14; wines from £30 Sweeping generalisations about countries are risky, but I’m willing to chance it with Switzerland: it’s expensive, tooth-achingly polite, efficient and profoundly committed to dairy fats. Heritage, a new Swiss-inspired restaurant, lovingly crafted from wood, leather and weapons-grade cholesterol, manages three out of the four, though the lack of efficiency wasn’t their fault. Shortly after the starters had been cleared, we were approached by the restaurant’s owner. We’d already escalated from the humble waiter who served my companions before I arrived, to the restaurant’s manager when I got there. Now we had the boss. For the second time in a week, he said, building works along Rupert Street here on the edge of London’s Soho had killed all the power, including to the kitchen. The lights were only being kept on by an emergency supply. This meant they could not complete our order. One main course was fine, but a fish dish was out. The potato gratin we’d ordered could be served because there was enough residual heat in the oven. At the end, when he tried to offer the whole meal for free, I demurred. He could comp the cost of the replacement for that fish dish. And that way I could write about the meal because, while they handled the outage exceedingly well, it really didn’t impact upon the essentials of our night of Alpine joy, served amid the humid depths of a London summer. Which is the first oddity: why would you open a restaurant serving food specifically designed to get you through a blizzard, in the depths of summer? A quick declaration of interest. My wife’s mother was Swiss. Fondues have been eaten unironically in my house for years. I know about the virtuous interplay of different cheeses. I know all about the booze-fuelled cheese comas that follow. I live for booze-fuelled cheese comas. And now here’s Heritage, an orgy of varnished dark wood, banquette and heel click. They are bringing us delightful deep-fried balls of Gruyère, because cheese dropped in the deep-fat fryer is a solution to most things. We have (bought in) bread and butter whipped with truffle oil, and a wine list that doesn’t believe it’s possible to offer anything below £30 a bottle. We also have speeches, tableside. Particular dishes are recommended, as if they are children who’ve just aced sports day. This whole “can I recommend” thing never ceases to baffle me. So you’re not recommending the other starters? Surely, they are all your children? It surely can’t be because the steak tartare you’re promoting is the second most expensive choice. That would be tacky. I ignore him, and choose the rosti with maple-glazed lardons and a Tomette de Brebis cheese. He tells me it’s a good choice and then recites all the things we’ve just read on the menu. I won’t bang on about this, because you now get the idea. It’s the kind of service that is desperate to please, but can’t help making you flinch. We get a proper slab of rosti, the crust of golden fried potato giving way to something softer in the middle. The cheese is rolling away in all directions. The bits of smoked bacon are salty and sweet. It is a nutritional outrage and therefore completely marvellous, as it should be for £14. The fondue arrives and it is just plain odd. There are many regional variations. The one you favour depends on your back story. This time generalisations really are risky. My wife’s family cleaves to a mixture of relatively bland Emmental for bulk because it melts efficiently into the white wine to form a coating emulsion, with handfuls of Gruyère for flavour. The fondue at Heritage is a mixture of Gruyère and elastic Raclette. The result is one of the most irritating fondues I have ever attempted to eat. It forms endless ribbons and strings, like Spider-Man is trying to get the hang of his kit, and failing. Alongside the bread there are drop-dead gorgeous plates of lovingly roasted carrots, courgettes and new potatoes. The fondue struggles to cling to the bread and fails completely with the vegetables, which want nothing to do with it. It is a food-engineering experiment gone wrong. The problem lies with both the choice of cheeses and the burner, which is a tea light. You can barely warm your hand on a tea light, let alone a startlingly small mug of melted cheese. It sets as we work. We clear it but are exhausted by the struggle. It’s a lot of effort for £16 a head. Oh, the humanity. We follow that with their star dish, slices of fillet steak self-cooked over a brazier of smouldering charcoal, because that’s fired up with a blowtorch and now they have no other power. It’s £50 a head (£44 on the online menu, but even I’m becoming tired of noting such sloppiness). There are pleasingly pokey grain mustard and horseradish sauces on the side, plus a strangely sweet bone marrow jus. We have been encouraged to get a side of the burnished potato gratin for £9. We do as we’re told and find ourselves with more stringy cheese and more potatoes. If you like the meditative business of grilling pieces of prime animal for yourself, and can blank out the stupid cost, it’s not a bad way to pass the time. Two of the desserts are robust Teutonic slabs of cake. We have a cinnamon sponge in a salted toffee sauce, and a very fine cherry cake beneath a dark chocolate shell. The latter is let down by a cherry sauce so overly sweetened the sugar is crystallising out. Our other dessert is a blood orange sorbet with a glug of eau de vie. We stare at it. The only selling point of blood oranges is the deepness of the colour. This is pale yellow. I ask the waiter if it’s definitely blood orange. He insists that’s what it said on the side of the box. I assume he means on the box of fruit, but no; he means on the box of sorbet. He tells me they bought it in from Woods Foodservice. Then they poured on a measure of eau de vie. Then they charged £14 for it. At which point the power comes back on, the air-conditioning kicks in and we sit staring at a £14 bought-in dessert, mouthing “WTF” at the table. We feel very politely and rather elegantly fleeced – which is exactly how the last thing you eat can leave a nasty taste in the mouth. News bites Just down from Heritage on Rupert Street is Xu, a Taiwanese restaurant from the team behind the ever-popular Bao. The interiors, all varnished wood and beige leather, are gorgeous; the menu is equally attractive. Do not miss the Char Siu Iberico pork, or the Shou Pa chicken, a charcoal-roasted bird with ginger and spring onion and aged white soy. But frankly everything is good (xulondon.com). Further evidence that Deliveroo is determined to dominate the restaurant sector. It is getting into selling ingredients from suppliers to restaurants. According to the company, a year-long trial has shown their procurement service can save businesses up to 20% on their raw ingredients. As well as the UK, the service will be offered in France, Spain and the United Arab Emirates. The fall out from the collapse of Jamie Oliver’s restaurant group continues. At least 70 staff are taking the company to an employment tribunal over the terms of their redundancies. Meanwhile, Dishoom is to take over and expand into the now closed Jamie’s Italian on St Martin’s Lane in London, and restaurateur Richard Caring has taken over three of the sites in the City of London, for his ever expanding Ivy Collection.

Anyone of a certain vintage possibly now has Rolf Harris’s Jake the Peg stumbling around their mind, brandishing his extra limb and wearing a raincoat. If you don’t, I’m unsure where to start. The past was a funny old place. That said, Peg in Hackney is very much all about the future, and that’s quite bizarre, too. Peg is a sort-of-Japanese restaurant. Not Japanese in any way to which the British may be accustomed, however: you can forget sushi, udon or okonomiyaki, though Peg certainly grills meats and delicate servings of offal, and presents them in a yakitori manner titivated with shichimi togarashi, yuzu kosho or finely grated horseradish. Dainty small plates, each served with an oomph of flavour. Peg serves agedashi tofu and slightly stinky amazake ice-cream made out of fermented sake leftovers, which is at first awful, then compelling and then life-changingly delicious, although at the same time rather unsettling. It’s green, for crying out loud, like something scraped from Oscar the Grouch’s home. But, by God, I want it again. The same goes for Peg’s entirely delicious Ine Mankai sake, which is sweet, smoky, pale pink and perilously gluggable. That tofu is exquisite, by the way, some of the best I’ve ever tasted. Thick cubes topped with an irresistible nori mush, crisp on the surface, smooth and yielding below, almost like sweet potato. It came with feathery tempura oyster mushrooms and a bowl of fragrant dashi. I accept that “exquisite tofu” will be an oxymoron to some; my brother refuses to touch the stuff, so convinced is he that it’s some sort of culinary aberration grown in chef’s armpits. But this is why I would never take him to Peg. It is only for deeply cool people such as myself, who don’t balk at the fact that Peg’s menu is on two boards above the open kitchen counter, a bit like a 1970s greasy spoon. One features only seven items explained in one word: “thigh”, “wing”, “heart”, “liver”, “mackerel”, “meatball”, “shiitake”; the other has approximately six “plates”: for example, cabbage, mizuna and sesame salad or a bowl of mixed fermented and pickled root vegetables. Prices for all of these things are reasonably low, between £4 and £9, which in the capital, at least, is quite rare. There is, of course, no menu online. Peg’s website is a single holding page, its background coloured in Farrow &amp; Ball Elephant’s Breath, that directs you to its Instagram site, where there is no menu, either, but there is an arty shot of a Studio One ska album featuring Roland Alphonso and Don Drummond. Probably best just to go and let them tell you all about it, because the staff are delightful. They’re that glorious type of food nerd with whom you would happily eat dinner, so let them rhapsodise about their suppliers, Flourish Produce, NamaYasai farm and Kernow Sashimi. Peg does have a phone number, but don’t bother ringing it because they don’t take reservations. I told you the future was brilliant. Besides, it’s all counter seating, so there are no cosy tables to reserve anyway; in fact, there are no tables full stop. You’re up on high stools, so, as Patsy Stone said, “The world’s your gynaecologist.” These counters, Peg says, are made out of thousands of compressed recycled yoghurt pots. No chef these days opens a restaurant without making reference to some pretty deep thoughts about the planet, although in Peg’s case I do believe them. This is the team behind P Franco and Bright; they are the real deal whom everyone else eventually copies. When you’re sat in Huddersfield in 2021 on an Ikea Råskog bar stool, eating chicken hearts off a bench made out of secondhand Zoom lollypop sticks, blame Phil Bracey, William Gleave and Byron Fini. This orchestrated foolishness, these small plates of Fosse Meadows chicken wings flavoured with notions of sansho and chenpi, or thighs enlivened with a paste of yuzu, chilli and salt, is where it all began. Peg will not be to everyone’s taste, but it is one of my favourite openings of 2019 so far. It is bold at a time when the restaurant world is being very cagey, and I respect them for it. First, we ignore them. Then we laugh at them. Then they feed us smoked mackerel broth with soft turnip and nori and ice-cream made of rubbish, and then they bloody win. • Peg 120 Morning Lane, London E9, 020-3441 8765.

Every time it slipped down the schedule, after yet more delays to this £25m refit, I had a touch of the Statler and Waldorfs. Owner Leonid Shutov’s plan was to commandeer level three of the £225m Leadenhall Building – or the Cheesegrater as it is unaffectionately called by Londoners who powerlessly acquiesce to these cute nicknames for hideous skyscrapers. Shutov would create a bigger, better, kookier, mid-air version of his firstborn, Soho’s Bob Bob Ricard. It’s worth noting that the original, classic Bob Bob feels like a fictitious, Kardashian-class Trans-Siberian Express dining carriage envisaged by Tim Robbins. It is a dark, glamorous, wilfully daft caviar-and-chicken-pie palace. “Press for champagne” tempts a button at every booth; and, as gimmicks go, that one has never got old. The all-new, reimagined Bob Bob would feature, we’d heard, rare Japanese bookbinding paper on the walls, identical twin private dining rooms – one in red and one in blue; 1888 Baron de Sigognac armagnac on the menu at £830 a pour, and 48,000 rare imported wall bolts pinning the whole hot mess together. You could still press for champagne, but now your table number would flicker on a ticker-tape neon track running around the walls. The highly respected chef Eric Chavot joined the project and stayed put, despite Bob Bob Cité feeling, at times, as imminent as a Morrissey and Marr reunion or a new George RR Martin release date. But I have eaten those words – with a side of escargot en persillade. Bob Bob Cité is open and, like it or loathe it, you cannot possibly ignore it. It is vast, eccentric, luxurious and shiny – oh so very shiny, like having dinner on the bridge of the Starship Enterprise. I ate twice here in one week, lingering on both occasions for multiple hours, chipping away at Chavot’s world-class, sturdy onion soup with baguette et beurre d’Isigny, or demolishing the excellent, albeit flamboyant, lemon meringue tart. Because, in the privacy of a Bob Bob Cité booth, with such good service and the real world so very far below, there’s a level of escapism that is wholly seductive. Restaurant World is on shaky ground in 2019, but at Bob Bob Cité it’s 1997: London is swinging, money is flowing; let’s all have a round of -18 degree Imperia vodka shots in tiny fancy glasses and stay out until one of us is pregnant by a Gallagher brother. I must stress that Bob Bob Cité is more than a triumph of posh hand soap, imported lampshades and over-delicious food. What Shutov’s eccentric dreamscape needed was a base of solid French cooking, and though Chavot’s relatively short menu is rife with Gallic glamour, you will be fed. You won’t leave hungry – bankrupt, perhaps, but not hungry. There are oysters gratinée teamed with black truffle hollandaise, and a good, fresh salade de tomate with silverskin anchovies. There’s a small, fat bowl of Scottish rump beef steak tartare with soft-boiled quail’s egg and, from “les grillades”, a ribeye steak with shallots at £32 and lobster thermidor at £48.50. Perhaps the best thing on the menu is the relatively simple grilled sea bream, its skin rubbed with lemon and saffron, that comes served with roasted cherry tomatoes – a snip at a mere £35. The language of Bob Bob Cité’s menu is a sort of restaurant Esperanto: thick slices of smoked salmon on a fancy, caviar-strewn potato salad are “chunky saumon fumé” – despite that sounding like something deluxe one might buy in Aldi for a cat. The vegetable pie has been sent to Siberia, returned to London via Paris, and is now on menu as “Le ‘Pie’ du Maraîcher”. It is a delicate, flat, delicious, prettily embossed, heart-valve-clogging dish of jerusalem artichoke and king oyster mushrooms in a sea-green champagne and truffle velouté. “I am eating a small mushroom pie for £21.50 and it doesn’t even have a pastry bottom. The chips are an extra seven pounds,” I text to my brother as an act of wilful and ongoing north/south provocation. “Absolute robbing bastards,” he replies, as is standard, eating a Ginsters Piri Piri Slice in a layby. “You understand nothing about fine dining,” I reply, airily. One of us is certainly in the right here. But after many years, I’m still just not sure who. • Bob Bob Cité 122 Leadenhall Street, London EC3, 020-3928 6600.

Starters and snacks £3-£9; mains £10-£49 (for sharing); desserts £5-£9; wines from £19 Heading into Guernsey’s St Peter Port from the airport, down lanes edged by well-tended stucco, I interrogate my cab driver about local restaurants. I do this, not because cab drivers know everything, but because they do know the conventional wisdom. Octopus, he told me, serves some great food, but the service can be a nightmare. A round of applause, then, for conventional wisdom, nailing it there. Octopus has an awful lot to recommend it, but it’s also an amiable shambles. Apparently, it’s less of a shambles than it was when it first opened in 2016. Still, if you are prone to the fear of being forgotten or ignored, or of going for long stretches without being fed, this may not be the place for you. Even so, it’s still worth the risk, because it’s almost the restaurant you want on a sea-licked island like this. The wood-clad building occupies a prime spot in the shadow of a forested hill at the south end of Havelet Bay, on the town’s edge. The view from the outside deck and the glass-fronted dining-room behind is across water to the castle and various outcrops and islands. This classy brand of rugged modernism stands in contrast to the bijou, old world-vibe of their other restaurant, Le Petit Bistro, back in the centre, which has a menu heavy with more French classics than you could shake a garlic-butter-smeared, snail-stuffed baguette at. Octopus is named after the beast at the heart of sometime Guernsey resident Victor Hugo’s story Toilers of the Sea, and the menu is indeed a many-legged creature. Or to put it another way, it’s completely nuts. Alongside a list of steaks, another of street food, a third of mussels (five different ways, in three different sizes), salads, flatbreads, sauces and more than a dozen sides, there’s also a bunch of ramen. There’s no reason why the good people of Guernsey shouldn’t have access to ramen, but it does make the kitchen seem very eager to please. Look, here’s the specials menu: three plats du jour at £13 each, a main course, a whole turbot to share for £65, and three nibbles. We get one of these: scallop “beards”, the frilly skirts cut away when the meat is liberated from the shell, floured and deep-fried to golden and served with a bowl of punchy rouille. They have the savoury-sweet edge of the best seafood and are satisfyingly chewy. We start with them, but I can see how they would also work as the perfect bar snack if, say, you had investigated the promise of their 50-strong gin list. We also get a sausage roll, and a fine porky thing it is too, in a pastry shell as glazed as an antique piece of wooden furniture. But the key to the menu here lies in the middle, where there’s a list entitled Crab Shack, offering oysters, whole crabs, lobster and various fish of the day served in ways many and various. From this we get three rock oysters straight up, keenly priced at £1.70 each, and three more grilled under a burnished champagne sabayon with spinach and seaweed, which is all cream and acidity and surf and hurrah. It’s a great way to start and it needs to be, because it takes 50 minutes from sitting down for any of this to land on the table. Waiters have to be flagged down like racing taxis as they attempt to skim, wild-eyed, past us. Generally, if we get the attention of one, they tell us they need to find another. There’s also some shameless upselling. While ordering starters I’m asked randomly if we’d like to add some scallops to that. What? To a huge sausage roll, six oysters and a bunch of curly deep-fried seafoodie bits? No, not really, thanks. It happens again with the second vital section in the middle of the menu headed Hot Seafood Pot Specialities: a stew of mussels, prawns, scallops and baby octopus. You choose which broth you want it in – marinière with new potatoes and parsley, say, or green Thai curry – and then decide whether to add a whole crab, half or whole lobster or a combination of the two. We choose the spicy bouillabaisse jus with fennel and chorizo with both whole crab and lobster to share, for what, at £49, is good value. The waiter asks us if we’d like a bigger lobster. I ask him how much. Instead of answering he returns with a tea towel-covered tray and pulls it back to reveal two fine, blue-grey creatures, claws twitching. He points to the bigger one. Again, I have to ask him how much. He mutters “£65.” I decline, because it really isn’t that much bigger. It’s also unnecessary. The real shame about all this rackety, chaotic, sometimes clumsy service is that it detracts from what is a truly glorious mess of seafood. It’s a huge dish to get up to your armpits in. They say it’s for one or two, but it could easily feed three. There is an ocean-deep broth that is nothing like either a bouillabaisse or a jus, but is spiced and ripe with tomato and chilli and the liquor the best shellfish offers up as it meets its end. We pull the meat from the lobster and crab, our shells heaping up in the bucket before us. We dig around for scallops and prawns, and suck the debris off the mussel shells. It’s completely engrossing, a single dish which for some is worth not only its own price, but also that of a flight. We drink a fairly priced Gavi di Gavi at £26, and work our way through the napkins and the wet wipes. We finish with an XL éclair filled with coffee cream, which looks like something a large dog would drag home in its jaws from a walk (or, to be honest, produce. Sorry.) Choux pastry like that is an achievement, though not massively pleasing to eat. Far better is a vivid plate of berries, cream and meringue, both soft and crisp. I did a lot of research on Guernsey restaurants prior to my trip. I stumbled across many menus offering lobster thermidor and dishes freighted with overworked adjectives. The insanity of its menu aside, Octopus stood out because it appeared to make an unstuffy virtue of the water at its door. Even allowing for the chaos, that’s exactly what it does. News bites Back on England’s southern Shore in Hove, there’s more big seafood action at The Urchin, an old boozer in a residential area with a big-fisted approach to that which swims. A short menu of standards like salt and pepper squid or whole crab with garlic butter is supplemented by an extensive list of specials which could include Thai green curry mussels, or clams with chilli, basil and cherry tomatoes, served in beautiful beaten copper bowls (urchinpub.co.uk). The site of what was Nuala in London’s Old Street has been taken over by a triumvirate of London’s Irish-born hospitality industry veterans: the chef Richard Corrigan, John Nugent of the Rotunda (inside Kings Place which also houses this newspaper) who will run front of house and Tony Gibney of Irish pub Gibney’s of Malahide, who will run the bar. There will also be live music. Deliveroo, the restaurant food home delivery company, has announced it will ‘expand aggressively’ during the rest of 2019. They plan to roll out to 6.5 million more households across the UK, meaning more than half the population will be covered.

Starters and sides £4-£9.50; mains, including cheesesteak £11-£12; desserts £6; and wines from £19 When I visit Passyunk Avenue, a retro diner on a scuffed backstreet in London’s Fitzrovia, the voice I hear in my head belongs to Josh Ozersky. Josh was a bull-necked, raging mensch of a man, who founded the food festival Meatopia, helped pioneer food blogging in New York via the Grub Street site and ended up as restaurant editor for Esquire. Most importantly, he carved out a niche for himself as the chronicler of what he called, “American vernacular cuisine”. His point was compelling: why should the classics of the American diner be any less deserving of love and scholarship than, say, the so-called cuisine de grand-merè of France? One broiling summer in New York a few years ago, we shot a video together for his YouTube channel, in which he took me to a bog standard joint on 3rd Avenue called Joe’s Jnr. There, he ordered most of the menu and then enthused with the acute eye of an experienced jeweller sizing up a piece by Fabergé. He wanted me to understand the importance of the viscosity of American cheese when melted, and how much better it was for the job than those weird aged cheddars we insist upon. He delivered a prose poem about the lacy, burnished white bread used in a grilled cheese sandwich, seared to crisp on the plancha. Best of all was his masterclass on their hamburger. He had authored a classic book on this one great food item, and wanted to explain the exquisite algebra of the bun to patty ratio, and how the two parts should align. He wasn’t wrong. If that burger had been served in London at that point, it would have been regarded as a miracle. In New York it was just the burger those stocky guys on 3rd Avenue knocked out. Josh died horribly young in 2015, after an epileptic seizure, and I miss his hectoring terribly. And now here I am at Passyunk Avenue, named after the road in Philadelphia across which two of the city’s great Philly cheesesteak rivals, Pat’s King of Steaks and Geno’s Steaks, face off against each other. I think Josh might have approved. It is a comfortable place, if you find sitting on benches that are not much evolved from planks comfortable. But then this is never going to be somewhere in which to linger. There are reruns of It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia muted on the plasma screens, while the sound system booms out Sweet Home Alabama and The Joker. Somewhere, there is a law insisting they must do this. And so to a confession. I have never eaten a cheesesteak in Philadelphia. I’ve eaten them in Los Angeles and New York, which I was directed to by people who knew their stuff – don’t ask me to recall the establishment’s names; they were holes in the wall and I was drunk – so I know what one should be: finely sliced steak, probably rib-eye, seared on a hot plate, then mixed in with cheese of some description, before being heaved into a soft, mildly sweet bun. It should be served with a pickle and a side order of “What you looking at?” Subtle, it ain’t. Authenticity has never troubled me as much as the answer to the question: does it taste nice? Oh God yes. The beef has been sliced and sliced again, properly seared, then mixed in with their own version of Cheez Whiz, or as the server put it “a kind of cheddar fondue”. They say it’s made on site, which is impressive because massive food corporations spend zillions trying to come up with something as engrossing, glowing and quasi-industrial as this. My fingertips tingle. My blood emulsifies. The bun, made by an outside bakery to their own recipe, is the perfect soft-yielding vehicle for the filling. Is it cheesy oniony beef? Or beefy oniony cheese? Or oniony cheesy… Oh never mind. Just know it’s a serious amount of sandwich for £11, which will stay with you, possibly for days. Alongside the variants on the Philly cheesesteak – you can add bacon because, as we know, everything tastes better with bacon – there are other classics of Ozersky’s American vernacular. There are, for example, buffalo chicken wings, deep fried then turned in exactly the right pounding sauce with the perfect lip-tingling smack of heat and salt and sour. There are tater tots, pebble-sized hash browns, which you can have doused in more cheese whiz and a blitzed bacon crumb. Check no health professionals are watching, before eating. Access to a defibrillator might come in handy. They also serve a cracking iceberg wedge salad. It is customary to sneer at the iceberg as the shell-suited lout of the salad drawer. This is because we insist upon shredding it. (Once, at New Covent Garden fruit and veg market, a trader told me that mass caterers love iceberg, ‘because you get a lot of plate out of one of those’.) But serve it as a wedge, piled with seared bits of chicken thigh, more bacon crumb and a blue cheese dressing brought to you live and direct from 1976, and it’s a beautiful, refreshing thing. We also try the roasted pork platter. Do not come to Passyunk Avenue and do this. The meat is described as porchetta, but is nothing of the sort. It is limp, depressed, grey slices of meat, that would have a much better life doused in more cheese whiz and shoved in a roll. We do not finish it. To be honest, we don’t finish much. This is a one dish kind of place, and we’ve ordered far more than is strictly necessary. We conclude with cannoli, and watch with pleasure as the pastry cylinders are delivered from a box behind the bar to be filled to order with a sweetened ricotta cream, studded with chocolate chips. They arrive looking like giant stubbed out cigarettes. They serve all the wines, which is to say both a red and a white. More important are the draft beers, including Passyunk Pale brewed in London. They also have the dirty, anti-icon which is Pabst Blue Ribbon by the can. Passyunk Avenue began life as a food truck and while it now has walls and windows, in truth that’s what it still feels like. The team behind this venture wanted a bit of Philadelphia in London. Having failed to find it, they created it for themselves. It’s a cheese whiz-smeared, blitzed bacon-pelted act of devotion. Josh Ozersky would have approved. News bites The Rule of Tum Burger Shop in Hereford, which now has a second outlet in Worcester, approaches the US burger repertoire with serious care. Theirs are serious burgers, made with beef from named farmers and piled with all the appropriate toppings. The menu also offers options made with pulled lamb, buttermilk fried chicken and falafel. All this and chicken wings, too (aruleoftum.com). In rather more expansive burger news, Shake Shack, which started as a hot dog cart in New York’s Madison Square Park, has projected global revenues for 2019 of $576m. In 2020, it expects to open 320 new locations and grow revenues to $700m. That’s a lot of frozen custard (shakeshack.com). Asia de Cuba, inside London’s St Martin’s Hotel, was one of the first restaurants I reviewed in 1999, when I started. I wasn’t exactly positive. I described ‘shoddy service, a stupid concept and ludicrous food’. The restaurant did just fine, but has closed after 20 years. It has been replaced by a pop-up serving dishes from Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia.

A bucolic establishment bolthole where David Cameron and Jeremy Clarkson hang out eating Blur-flavoured cheese strings at one of Alex James’ regular soirées de fromages. Who’d want to live there? OK, I’ll start: me. The Cotswolds are heavenly. Nether Westcote, for example, is close to the picturesque, medieval town of Burford, which has a high street festooned with antiques shops and charming tea rooms selling fresh, plump lardy cakes. Burford looks like the set of one of those Murder, She Wrote specials when Jessica Fletcher visits England without ever actually leaving the Universal Studios backlot, by simply flinging about ducks, scones and Aston Martins. The Feathered Nest, six miles down the road, is an exquisitely restored malthouse, dating from 1692, that gazes down on to the Evenlode valley. Its chef Kuba Winkowski recently won the Craft Guild of Chefs’ National Chef of the Year award, plus various other accolades, so do not darken its doors requesting a pie. No, Winkowski does fancy fine dining over several courses: small plates of sturgeon and caviar littered with fresh nasturtium leaf, Mangalitza pig with Silesian dumpling or duck tortellini with winter truffle. Tiny, pre-dinner snacks of finely hewn smoked haddock tart and a basket of fresh, sticky cheese rolls appear, then an excellent, and minuscule, taster of pumpkin soup. Produce is exemplary, flavours paramount. There is loads to love here. There is a full vegetarian menu, and a children’s one featuring meatballs and brownies. If you are one of those annoying, sylph-like women who can wear Gap Kids clothes, I’d suggest giving that a go, because, otherwise, four dishes off the elegant adult menu cost £70 and six £90. The two signature dishes of the evening, octopus and dumpling, in our case, come with an extra £10-15 supplement. You’re in a country pub with bar stools made of horse saddles, yet you’re looking at a menu more suited to The Ledbury in Notting Hill. Even so, on a Saturday evening, the place is swamped. The Cotswolds are not short of customers who will go with Winkowski’s vision. Several of them were staying in The Feathered Nest’s rooms, which, according to the website, require a two-night booking at weekends. Without dinner, accommodation for even the cheapest room would be getting on for £600. Rolling my eyes, I booked into Mollie’s Motel And Diner, 18 miles away, for one night at £55, but more of that adventure later. The main challenge a large pub like The Feathered Nest faces, when attempting to replicate The Ledbury or even Fera at Claridge’s, is that such places require a squadron of top-level staff working in nigh-eerie harmony, leaving no knife unswapped, no glass unfilled, no dietary quibble uncherished. That is the magic. The Feathered Nest, however, has an eighth of the staff it needs, so it’s perhaps unsurprising that our request for no pork, repeated three times, saw one dish arrive with lardo, then the next wrapped in pancetta, and without apology. At Claridge’s, this would feasibly result in me having to talk down the maître d’ from a public seppuku ceremony. We drink two glasses of Château St Michelle and range through the menu, eating the likes of a wonderful, slender slab of salmon on an inky reduction of black garlic. Charles is enamoured of his sweetbreads on a pungent, pureed cauliflower cheese showered with bianchetto truffle. Guinea fowl appears with a confit egg yolk and a pixie’s handful of morels. It is faultless. But by course five, sat in a beautifully hammered-on conservatory, a sense of cabin fever that I often experience during fancy dinners takes hold. There is a brilliant bit in one Thanksgiving episode of Friends, just after Rachel unveils her beef English trifle and Phoebe admits her love for Jacques Cousteau, when Joey’s meagre manners leave him and he bangs the table shouting his innermost desire: “I want to go!” I felt like that while waiting about, sitting downwind of loud conversations about the consent debate, Corbyn and house prices, and knowing both that the staff are far too hectic even to visit this room any more, and that I still have a soufflé on order (albeit a very nice rhubarb one with a blood orange kick), plus the revealing of the non-surprise surprise petit fours and then a hunt for the card machine and, eventually, my coat. The starry sky – no light pollution here – on the drive afterwards warmed my heart completely, but dinner left me a little cold. • The Feathered Nest Nether Westcote, Oxfordshire, 01993 833030.

Also in Bristol and Oxford. Dishes £2.50-£8; wines from £17 Eating well is an expression of normality. When we’re not in crisis, we eat well. When we’re not at war, we eat well. It’s also a way of reclaiming normality: of refusing to let the darkness win. It’s why I went to the Coconut Tree in Cheltenham, the original outpost of a small group of places serving what they describe as Sri Lankan street food. A few weeks ago, the island made headlines for the most terrible of reasons: a grim narrative of suicide bombs and body counts. Countries are not defined by atrocity, but by the good things. Great cooking is always one of the good things. A restaurant review cannot defeat terror but, at the very least, talking about the country’s vivid food – its way with coconut, turmeric, cardamom and chilies – is so very much better than talking about all the other stuff we’ve heard from Sri Lanka recently. The Coconut Tree belongs to five friends who first met at school just outside Colombo, when they were 11. They followed each other to Britain, first to Croydon. I love Croydon. I drive through it often. Some of my best friends have even driven through Croydon. But I do find myself marvelling at the intensity of the culture shock they must have experienced after a life in Colombo. Inexplicably, they all decided to leave Croydon for Cheltenham where, in need of somewhere to live, they were offered the rental of a knackered old pub on the St Paul’s Road in the student area, with a flat above. Each evening after work they did it up, finally quitting their day jobs and opening it as a restaurant in late 2016. It’s the hospitality business equivalent of Summer Stock, only with less Judy Garland and more fermented rice flour batter. This is a bare-bones fit-out, because any money spent on the room could only have been recouped via the menu pricing and they clearly wanted to keep that low. They don’t do napkins. Instead they give you a roll of kitchen paper. The most expensive dish here is £8 and there’s only one of those. It is cheap and resoundingly cheerful, as are the staff who seem genuinely pleased to see everybody. A special commendation goes to the luscious beard, belonging to one of the original five, which put in a thrilling performance throughout our meal. Parts of the ceiling are covered with Sri Lankan newspapers. There are high counters and lower tables, with the kind of bench seating men of a certain age like to whine about. There are cushions for those who are proctologically challenged. They now have two more outlets in Bristol and one in Oxford, with another due to open in Cardiff shortly. It’s easy to see why it’s succeeded. There is a raucous, rough-edged enthusiasm to the food, all of which comes at great speed in white and blue prison-style enamelware. Fat Sister is a hefty pumpkin curry, made with large pieces of squash, cooked until they can be carved with a spoon, in the sort of thick, pungent coconut milk and turmeric sauce that spoon could then stand up in. It costs £4. On the lighter side there’s shredded cabbage with a pleasing crunch, stir-fried with more turmeric, spices and shaved coconut. That costs £3. There’s a strong fish offering. The words “hot battered spicy cuttlefish” tell you all you need to know, but I’ll tell you more because it’s my job: the deep-fried crunchy strands of cephalopod, the colour of a sunset, are made to sing by the sugary tangles of heavily caramelised onion and spices which shatter under the teeth like butterscotch. I end up running my finger around the bottom of the bowl to get the last bits. I do this a lot, to be fair. I just don’t always admit to it. The menu declares that there are just eight portions a day of the clay-pot fish, which sounds like a come on. It’s a very effective one, because we order it and are pleased to have done so. The stew bobs with slabs of tuna which have not yet disintegrated in a thick, hot and sour liquor with an unashamedly peppery kick. There are also devilled prawns, their brilliant crimson carapace glazed with a sweet-sour sauce in an even deeper red, which gives the whole dish a vaguely neon glow. The only meat dish we have is the black pork, made with belly in a fighty sauce the colour of night, after lights out. I ask our waitress what’s in that sauce. She tells me it has 18 spices. Which are? No, that’s all we’re getting. Certainly, there’s black pepper in there. An awful lot of black pepper. (For clarity, the menu announces that specific allergy issues will be answered.) I mop with flaky triangular pieces of roti, and I mop again until the enamel glaze is at risk. The only dish that doesn’t quite do the thing is the hopper, the famously bowl-shaped fermented rice flour and coconut milk pancake. It’s served with a fried egg cooked into the bottom and various relishes including a pungent coconut sambal. It’s certainly a looker. It’s just floppy and not quite up to that served at the eponymous Hoppers, in London. Then again, it’s also cheaper. Plus, with every single dish arriving at once, we probably left it just a little longer than we should have done. Hopper honour is saved by another one, served folded and still warm, dribbled with golden syrup and held in place by scoops of an almost sorbet-like coconut ice cream. It’s a kind of Sri Lankan crèpe Suzette. There’s also the mellifluously named watalappam, a set coconut pudding with treacle and nutmeg, with a glycaemic index so high you’d need a piece of graph paper the size of a house to plot it. It’s delicious, if unfinishable. They offer Sri Lankan ales and ginger beers, and local West Country ciders alongside a utilitarian list of wines. They’ll also serve you a turmeric coconut latte and a salted caramel espresso martini. That’s not my idea of a good time, but I won’t judge you if it’s yours. Much. The Coconut Tree manages that rare trick of being totally laid-back and completely on point at the same time. It also happens to tell a terrific story about Sri Lanka; one that comes with a small bill to finish. That’s a perfect happy ending. News bites Elsewhere in Cheltenham the evolved Indian restaurant Prithvi, ancient Sanskrit for Mother Earth apparently, has moved into No 38, the boutique hotel which is part of the Lucky Onion group. Dishes I enjoyed there during the Cheltenham Jazz Festival included a chicken-thigh curry with pieces of crispy chicken skin and fenugreek, and a thrilling lamb dish (prithvirestaurant.com). After much preparation, chefs Andrew Clarke and Doug Sanham last week finally launched the Pilot Light, a campaign targeted at combating the stigma around depression, addiction and mental health issues within the hospitality industry. Find out more at pilotlightcampaign.co.uk. Signs of continuing strife in the chain-restaurant world. The Restaurant Group, which operates Garfunkel’s and Frankie &amp; Benny’s, plans to offload another 22 sites, bringing to 44 the number it is looking to sell.

Should you wish to experience a flash of this legendary dancefloor’s ambience, I recommend drinking three, four or even five glasses of skin-contact Cosimo Maria Masini, then visiting Levan’s bathroom. It is a softly lit, inkily painted, one-person water closet with a speaker pumping out buoyant electronic, post-disco and garage tunes. It’s like being front and centre for a live 2am 1981 performance by Sylvester. I’m not certain if this works without the wine. Neither am I certain that any of the late Jonathan Gold’s Pulitzer prize-enticing restaurant critiques started with his views on the loos, but I am a firm believer that a restaurant is almost as much about mood as it is food, and that the team behind Levan – chef Nicholas Balfe and his front-of-house partners Mark Gurney and Matt Bushnell – are engineers of the new wave of highly relaxed yet incredibly drilled hospitality. I’m a fan of Salon on Brixton’s Market Row, their first venture, but I like Levan ever so slightly more. It is a welcoming room, painted midnight blue, with an open kitchen and upbeat staff whom you can’t help but befriend. The menu is a bit medieval rustique Europe with a Manhattan skeleton. It put me in mind of my beloved Little Owl on Bedford Street in the West Village, another gorgeous neighbourhood joint with a menu that leaves you sated, rather than with a stomach lined with fragments of clarified yeast and burnt hay. Far from it. At Levan, you can expect a list of wholly enticing potential deliciousness to be put in your paws. For instance, comté fries with saffron, or soft baked onions with bleu d’Auvergne and walnuts, or a piece of pie oozing vacherin and stuffed with trompette mushrooms and soft potato. Those comté “fries” are, in fact, chunks of deep-fried chickpea flour batter with a cheesy centre and an extra layer of powdery comté on top for extra badness. They arrive with a perfect puddle of sunset-coloured saffron aïoli. A sharing dish that played on the internal food jukebox of my mind for several days after was the caramelised celeriac ravioli with dashi butter. It sounds wrong, in principle, like a clash of hard-to‑love, nutty root veg in delicate dough with a Japanese-influenced umami undercurrent. And it is all of that, but it’s also the greatest vegetarian dish ever, and came with blissful roast jerusalem artichokes. For meaty people, there are the likes of Angus beef tartare with anchovy or old spot pork chop. There are also rather stinky, earthy but ultimately devourable duck rillettes with crisp cornichons and a boudin noir on endive. One could just as easily show up to Levan and share an array of the snacks – the tempura mushrooms with sesame vinaigrette and the daintily plated house-cured sardines, say – before moving on to a selection of cheeses (a Swiss alpine monlesi and a gabarre goat’s cheese from the Loire, neither of which I’d spotted on menus elsewhere). I like a dinner where I’m not just laughing, but also learning. Likewise, Levan has an enormo wine list favouring the type of biodynamic European bottles that these days really will make you look like a terrible dinosaur if you don’t at least try one. Bluffer’s guide: do say, “Gosh, this organic merlot tastes so much nicer now that I know it was transparently sourced from a small artisanal supplier!” Do not say, “Sod this, I’ve bought my own Barefoot white zinfandel”, and then clank around in a mini-mart carrier bag on the floor. Puddings at Levan are possibly less world-changing than the snacks and main attractions, but there was an espresso and hazelnut choux pastry, rather like a Paris-Brest, that was decadently charming. By this point, I had eaten out in London three times that day already. I’d late-brunched at the very good Lino in St Paul’s and lunched at the decidedly OK Brigadiers in the Bloomberg Arcade, before moving on to Levan and stoically continuing to eat on your behalf. Even so, by 10pm, these layers of choux and espresso-addled cream were entirely compelling. On reflection, the mont blanc after-pudding pudding and the large glass of sticky toffee apple-tinged Monbazillac were probably unnecessary. Levan, I like you. Probably a bit too much. Nothing good can come of this. • Levan 12-16 Blenheim Grove, London SE15, 020-7732 2256. Open Tues-Fri 8am-10.30pm, Sat 10am-11.30pm, Sun 10am-3pm. About £35 a head, plus drinks and service.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(418,'2019-03-08T10:00:41Z','Gloria, London EC2: ‘Kicks Brexit gloom up the arse’ – restaurant review | Grace Dent','Gloria is completely at odds with London’s restaurant scene right now. It is lots and lots of hopelessly optimistic, wanton fun. Along a kerb in Shoreditch of a Friday night, around 100 folk were attempting to gain entry to this new Italian trattoria in order to taste “Filippo’s big balls”. I generally balk at restaurant queues, because they tend to attract all the usual joyless, food-scene suspects: trust-fund types harvesting content for their Vogon poetry blogs, and those foodie couples who are a bit like swingers, in that one of them is much less into it all and would rather be down Turtle Bay. But this was quite a sexy queue, full of messy-haired, pouting, snake-hipped European sorts, all flocking towards the pizzas, pastas, cicchetti and dolci, as well as the well-stocked bar that serves until 2am. On the evening in question, the feasibly unhinged Parisians who have opened this multi-floored 160-seater had scrawled BREXITALIA messily on a vast banner and attached it to the building’s front. This meant that, at first glimpse, Gloria resembled somewhere you might drink snakebite after a riot, but on closer inspection revealed a purposefully naff, twinkly, 1970s Capri glam with frilly cream awnings, pink velour seating and overcrowded bar surfaces covered in pretty tat and obscure vermouths. A private wine room stocks more than 3,000 bottles of Italian wines, including a nerdy selection of barolos, but you can pick up a bottle of trebbiano or sangiovese for £23. Gloria is styled with the intensity of a Scorsese movie set; specifically, a scene in which the antihero takes out a woman who is out of his league to get her tipsy on Nardini grappa riserva and unhook her bra. Gloria’s serving staff are young, hyperactive, apparently-Italians-but-who-cares, mostly male and wearing billowing, pink candy-striped outfits like Victorian night-dresses. The playlist ranges, in tangential swipes, from Ghanaian highlife (King Bruce) to Chicago house (Ten City) to Northern Irish electronic (Bicep) to Girlfriend In A Coma by The Smiths. I know, I know – but I’m serious. The menu, of a night-time, is utterly indecipherable. Ordering is sheer chance. The lighting is dim, the menu is printed on dark cream card in 10-point burgundy. Descriptions lurch between pseudo-Italian and a sort of nudgy-winky, Carry On movie English that I’m calling Sid James-ese. One minute you’re peering at the carciofo alla giudia, muttering, “OK, carciofo, that’s deep-fried artichoke … I think”, and the next you’re suddenly in among the Black Mamba cuttlefish pasta, the aforementioned Filippo’s big balls – slow-cooked meatballs with a pecorino centre – or a “YouPorn” pizza. Obviously I found the names phallocentric and problematic, and cried most of the following day. The culatello con cotenna has the straightforward menu note: “To ham what Wu-Tang Clan is to hip-hop.” If all that sounds exhausting, the bathrooms are a fresh sort of gender neutral, in that the cubicles have doors made of one-way glass, so if you’re sitting to pee, you look directly into the eyes of people of all sexes. They are the Schrödinger’s bog of the bathroom debate. I should probably mention the food. It’s so easy to get distracted by all of this jolly, precisely orchestrated chaos. Yer actual dinner in places like Gloria is usually where things tend to fall apart. But, confoundingly, everything we had was really good, if not downright delicious. A fresh Puglian burrata cremosa appeared on a vivid green puddle of extra-virgin olive oil, and that deep-fried carciofo came with cacio e pepe sauce for dipping. Artichoke can be a vast disappointment, a triumph of effort over return, but Gloria’s is the best being served in London right now. We eschewed “The 10-level lasagne” in favour of pasta al tartufo, a satisfying, dank bowl of fresh mafalda ribbons littered with black Molise truffle, mascarpone and button mushrooms. The Big Mamma carpaccio is a gigantic, oval plate of fine-quality beef, plus leaves and parmesan, that could feed at least three. “Vegan (De)Light” is a portobello mushroom on a skewer with some sort of chickpea and hazelnut gloop and an aubergine mush. I sense it was added to the menu through gritted teeth. We ate a fine “cookigasmic” praline tart for pudding and knocked back the complimentary limoncello that, like all women of my vintage, I want to believe I was given because I’m special and pretty. Gloria is kicking Brexit gloom up the arse with 120mm Miu Miu stiletto pumps. You can’t help but admire its balls. • Gloria 54-56 Great Eastern Street, London EC2, no telephone.

It’s a full eight miles from the “Welcome to Scotland” sign. “So, you’re being petty,” you may be thinking. “It’s basically a Scottish restaurant near Gretna Green, right?” To which I say, “You fundamentally misunderstand Border people.” Carlisle is fiercely English. And no, this is not petty at all. We are still in deep umbrage with Gretna over Malcolm III’s invasion in 1061. Meanwhile, Gretna is still livid over multiple historical slights, not least of which is a period circa 1982 when Russ Abbot’s CU Jimmy character led to coachloads of English tourists at Gretna Services, bleating unintelligible faux-Scots and wearing ginger wigs attached to tartan bonnets. Another thing about the incredibly English Lounge on the Green, is that it recently won “best newcomer restaurant” at the glitzy Carlisle Living Awards. Fancy PR agency-led campaigns to lure punters are rare in Cumbria; most restaurants here live or die by word of mouth. I’d heard the buzz about Lounge on the Green and its chef, James Hill, via several sources. This is a former furniture shop, in a sedate village, just off junction 44 of the M6, that now serves delicate joys such as tuna carpaccio on herb-crusted poached quail’s egg and ham hock terrine on celeriac puree. The Lounge is a tiny bit fancy, a birthday treat kind of place, or somewhere to salvage your love life over three courses for just short of £30. The food is experimental – in that it may be the first time some locals have seen pork cooked in pedro ximénez sherry – but not unapproachably so. Hill’s style is unpretentious but definitely forward-reaching, which is something that can be a little scarce throughout Cumbria. I quibble frequently that my native county suffers slightly from having little middle ground between chips and burger pub grub and the giant leap to foraged and tweezered Michelin-star tasting menus in pricey country house hotels set in corners of the Lakes that the GPS refuses to acknowledge. (That said, I must give honourable mention to the much‑admired Pentonbridge Inn around 13 miles up the road.) So, yes, a lofty, well-travelled visitor to Lounge on the Green might sigh at a menu of scallops, braised brisket or pan-roasted chicken breast, but as a Carlisle woman on a quick home visit, it makes my heart sing to walk into a place like the Lounge on a wet Thursday night in October to find an entire table of laughing ladies of a mature vintage eating pork fillet steeped in PX with black pudding bonbons, served on crushed squash. Hill, I feel, has a good, honest grip on all the basics that make a restaurant a pleasure. He has found chipper, attentive front-of-house staff who look genuinely delighted to see you. He’s bought comfy chairs with deep cushions that one can linger on and, more crucially, that his staff will allow you to linger on. And, perhaps even more crucially, he has a good sense for seasoning, and plates all this up in a generous, hearty way that still holds some finesse. My crowd rampaged through the menu, loving especially the excellent, rich, soft braised brisket on a pleasing cauliflower risotto with horseradish shoots. The Lakeland beef rump was perhaps the menu’s most robust dish, appearing like a glorious challenge, topped with haggis-stuffed potatoes, a pile of onion rings and red wine gravy. A well-judged fillet of sea bass with buttered lobster arrived with saffron potatoes on orange and dill root veg. As with the best impromptu dinners that turn into great memories, the thing my lot have kept talking about is the puddings. A just-sweet-enough, gorgeously presented blackberry creme brulee came with the nuttiest, most delicious pistachio ice-cream I think I’ve ever tasted. A feisty, dark chocolate mousse was flecked with raspberry “textures”. The sticky toffee pudding was a plentiful wodge that will firmly glue the trap of any family member who may have whined that the fayre was too fiddly. In a small commuter village, just north of Carlisle – OK, practically Scotland, if we’re being honest – Hill is cajoling the locals to eat “textures”. This is why, I think, they’re calling him best newcomer. It’s a title with which I agree. • Lounge on the Green 27 The Green, Houghton, Carlisle, 01228 739452.

Starters £7.50-£12; main courses £10-£28; wines from £26 If Martha was a friend of mine, I’d be begging her to get her shit together. I’d be telling her she has buckets of potential, but that it won’t come to anything if she carries on like this. Get some sleep. Stop winging it. As it happens, Martha’s is a restaurant in London’s Soho, and this is still the speech it needs to hear. Because hiding beneath the posturing and the chaos and the unflamed dessert – we’ll get there – are the beginnings of a terrific night out. It looks the part. Martha’s describes itself as a slice of American night-life pie. There are curving, dark leather banquettes and booths to slouch in until you have a spinal disorder, and the walls are hung with shimmery deep red silk. There are blow-up photos of models who look like they’ve stopped to strike a pose en route to rehab. There are cabaret club lamps on the tables and there is greenery. There is an awful lot of greenery. If the word “louche” wasn’t scribbled on the design mood board, you know it was implied. They promise live jazz and drag queens. Given I make part of my living playing the former, I’m always going to be up for that. If I can get in. The recorded phone message insists they don’t take bookings for dinner. The website doesn’t agree, swiftly offering me an 8.30pm table. I am delighted, if confused. Then the digital neediness starts: a confirmatory email 24 hours out, followed by a text 30 minutes before the allotted time, announcing that if we don’t arrive punctually, they’ll give our table to some of the other “fabulous” people who are desperate to get in. I don’t need to tell you that it’s never more than half full, do I. Still, when the nice chap on reception manages to break away from the conversation he’s having with his colleague, we are seated and handed both a food and drinks menu. The latter is a joy. First, the paper leaflet looks like its been soaked in water and then dried out on a radiator. Secondly the cover has been printed one way up and the contents another. Ach, don’t stress the little things. Our table is attended by two very lovely, very shiny, very young people. It turns out that she is just three hours into her first shift and is being mentored. The chap mentoring her, hovering just behind, has been here a magnificent four days. Together they tell us that Martha’s fried chicken with honey truffle sauce, the one dish they’ve been hyping all over their socials, is off. You might have enjoyed looking at the Instagram pics, but don’t you dare think about eating it. Suddenly another waiter turns up to take our order. He does so without a notebook. I ask him if he’ll remember what we wanted. “Sure”, he says. He goes away to the till. He returns to say “Can I just go through that with you…” I tell him cheerily that it’s cheating; he can’t bottle it now. We place an order and I get up to pop to the loo downstairs (signified by “Arthur’s” and “Martha’s”). As I leave, my foot catches in the lamp’s cable. It goes flying and I almost hit the deck. Our waiter looks on. He says, “That keeps happening.” I say, “You might want to sort it then.” He says, “Yes…” with a long final sibilant, like the notion needs to bed in. So, anyway, the waiter gets the order right and some of the food is great and some is calamitous. Crab croquettes are nothing of the sort. They’re much better than that. There is no supporting creamy medium like a bechamel. They are almost entirely fresh crab, with lots of chilli, which is exactly what you want. Rings of calamari, by contrast, are rubbery, bouncy tooth-flossers from which the breadcrumb coating sloughs off, as if it’s the skin of a snake that has places to be. An iceberg wedge with blue cheese and bacon is a reminder that this much maligned lettuce still has a role in our lives. Main courses are equally hit and miss. The hit is the New York Strip, a seared sirloin steak served the right side of both pink and Old Testament bible thick. It comes with a creamy peppercorn sauce which appears to have been completely blitzed. There are no peppercorns. Instead there is a massive hit of white pepper. It’s astringent and weirdly compelling. Unlike the cauliflower risotto, which is a salty, acrid mess of failed vegetal matter. As I taste it, I can hear the slap it’s going to make as the uneaten remains hit the black bin bag in the kitchen. We have finished a bottle of rosé, so we order glasses of pinot grigio to kill the taste of the risotto. This time the notebook-less waiter doesn’t get away with it. They bring us more rosé. He clocks that something is wrong, brings us the wine we wanted and doesn’t charge us for the first two glasses. Desserts include a banana split that is a mighty victory of tinned squirty cream and a lemon meringue pie, which the menu says will be “flamed at your table”. Well we just have to do that, don’t we, because the promised floor show hasn’t materialised. There is no live jazz. A couple of chaps in Diane von Furstenberg-style jump suits, with impeccable smoky eye makeup and pageboy wigs, flounce around the tables, giving it fabulous. A waiter plonks the lemon meringue pie on the table. We say, “Will it be flamed now?” He looks baffled and wanders off. No floor show for us, then. It is exactly as you might imagine a lemon meringue pie that arrived in the restaurant in a white cardboard box might taste. And yet, while dinner at Martha’s made me despair, it didn’t make me hate the place. Towards the end I looked around and clocked that a whole bunch of tables were singing along to Macy Gray’s I Try on the sound system, and by that time of night it seemed like a great place to be. Some of the food does the thing, and while the dear staff might not quite be getting the direction they need, they meant well. Yeah, I know. These really are the excuses we make for a much-loved friend, whom we know is a car crash. Oh come on Martha; please just sort yourself out. You have it in you to be very special. News bites For a reliable slice of New York try Joe Allen, just off London’s Strand. Recently it was forced to leave its home of 40 years after a group led by Robert De Niro announced plans to turn the building into a hotel. The hotel fell through but Joe’s had already moved, taking the original wooden bar with it. And it still does the thing. It serves one of the best Caesar salads in London, the burger remains off menu and it understands pecan pie (joeallen.co.uk). The gloriously funny George Egg is returning to the Edinburgh fringe this summer, with a new show about the joys of makeshift cookery. After demonstrating how to make dinner in a hotel room with only a kettle and a Corby trouser press, Movable Feast is about cooking on trains, planes and automobiles (anarchistcook.info). All change in the hotel business. At Brown’s in London, the poorly reviewed Heinz Beck is out and Adam Byatt of Trinity in Clapham is in. Meanwhile in the Lake District, Simon Rogan, who has closed Fera at Claridge’s in London, is opening Henrock at Linthwaite House on Lake Windermere.

Starters £6-£16; mains £12-£17.50; desserts £6; wines from £29 While it would be wrong to argue that most of the Indian subcontinent’s food is brown, it’s easy to see how a meal at Lucknow 49, the second London enterprise from chef Dhruv Mittal, might make you reach that conclusion. It’s a parade of dishes which, on a colour chart, would run the gamut from “dark earth” through “silted river bed” all the way to “ploughed field”. Personally, I have no problem with brown food; some of the most intense, strident dishes I have ever eaten have been brown. In cooking, caramelisation is your friend and caramel is brown. Others feel differently. Which may explain why, half way through dinner, I find myself staring at a lightly sauced cauliflower, dressed with a thin scab of shimmering silver leaf. Some will protest that precious metals as food decoration is a cultural thing, with a venerable history in Indian cookery. But I’m not in India. I’m on Maddox Street on the edge of London’s Mayfair, where there’s already too much pointless gilding. I don’t like eating things which serve no nutritional purpose. I particularly don’t like eating things which are destined to travel straight through me so that the product at the other end turns out so glittery you could hang it on a Christmas tree if, say, Tim Burton was in charge of the decorations. Apart from offering the opportunity to make poo jokes in a restaurant review – never to be missed – there’s a more serious point here. How do we evaluate a restaurant like this, where the substantial bill clearly pays for things like silver leaf on the cauliflower, which have nothing to do with the food? For a start, Lucknow 49 is a very comfortable restaurant, literally so. The upholstered bench seating is stacked with throw cushions and bolsters – so many, indeed, that I have to chuck a few off to create a space in which to wriggle my sizeable arse. There is olive green paintwork, as well as what looks like hand-printed decoration around the archway into the back-dining room, and blocky floral prints. It’s a self-conscious take on the domestic, the sort of relaxed style that costs proper money. Accordingly, the cheapest bottle of wine is £29 for something drinkable the name of which I can’t recall, and the dinner bill for two will easily break £130. Let’s stop there for a moment. The fact that you can visit a serviceable high-street curry house and pay buttons for indeterminate animal protein batch-cooked in a glowing sauce, which will repeat on you for days, does not mean food from the Indian tradition should never cost as much as that from France, Italy or Japan. If you believe that, you are dismissing the whole of Indian culture as somehow inferior. You will need to have a long hard talk with yourself. The food just needs to be worth it. At Lucknow 49, some of it pretty much is and some of it really isn’t. (The £9 paratha wraps stuffed with grilled lamb for takeaway at lunchtime may be the best deal). It all comes with a compelling narrative: after the fall of the Mughal empire, the royal family and their cooks shifted from Delhi to Lucknow. The double lamb chops here, cooked over charcoal, are big, meaty beasts, with a fine char, hot, crisped fat, and the rising scent of newly roasted spices. Lucky royal family. The online menu shows them to be £12.50 for two, which is good value for this quantity and quality of meat. I assume it was too much value, because at the restaurant these terrific chops are actually £16. There are a few examples of this, which a polite person would describe as unfortunate. The menu has been updated since my visit. Boned chicken thighs are marinated in a saffron-flavoured cream before being charcoal grilled and are buttery and rich in all the right places. They are proof, if needed, that thigh wins out over breast every time. Potato and green chilli patties are sturdy rather than impressive. Flatbreads, stuffed with lentils and rice dumplings and a heavy dollop of yogurt and chutney, make up the numbers rather than thrill. Of the mains the true star is the raan masala. A classic raan recipe calls for a leg of lamb to be roasted for at least six hours and for as much as a day, until it has all but fallen apart into its deep dark sauce, with the edge of that caramel which comes with the virtuous interaction of meat and heat. Here, it is offered on the bone, to which strands cling with little resolve. It’s a boisterous bit of overtly butch cookery. Come here for this. If you can ignore the silliness of the silver leaf, there’s an equal heft to the cauliflower dish in its own dun-coloured sauce. Most importantly it has been timed perfectly. It could have been so much watery mush to be gummed away, but the cauliflower has tension and bite. Whole quail steamed in a stridently spiced gravy points up one of the issues with this kind of cookery. When a sauce is so multilayered and full on, the meat under it could be anything; quail is delicate and doesn’t quite stand up to this armed assault, but the dish is not an unwelcome presence. Dhruv Mittal announced himself previously with a restaurant in Soho called Dum Biryani which, unsurprisingly, focused on pots of baked, accessorised rice. Curiously it is the goat biryani here which is the least impressive or generous. It’s just a little dry and meagre. The meat is tough. Still there is a luscious, albeit small serving of dal makhani for £7 with which to lubricate it. Finally, there are a couple of extremely sweet desserts, a carrot halwa and a milk cake with alphonso mango, to detain you, although not for very long. This is one of those moments where not only do I have to separate the impact of silver leaf from the underlying dish, but also my very pleasant night out from the cost of the experience. Understand Lucknow 49 as a relaxed Indian restaurant in London’s Mayfair that will only occasionally knock your socks off, but will still show you a nice time along the way, and you won’t be disappointed. Bizarrely, in a complex London restaurant sector that’s sometimes tricky to navigate, it’s more of a recommendation than it might seem. News bites Maddox Street has long been home to a bunch of serious places to eat. They’re never cheap – this is London’s Mayfair, after all – but some are very good indeed. Among those is the original branch of Goodman, which is firmly in the premier division of steakhouses. There’s a strong choice of both breeds and cuts, all treated with due care and attention, as well as killer sides like the Josper grilled tomatoes and the truffle mash (goodmanrestaurants.com). While we’re in the area I have to record my dismay at the closure of Mark Jarvis’s restaurant Stem, just around the corner from Maddox Street on Princes Street. It was that rare thing: a small bistro knocking out cracking food at a reasonable price. Jarvis has blamed the closure on building works in the area which have harmed business and says they may come up with another plan for the site. I’ll keep my fingers crossed. Meanwhile, in Manchester, the soon-to-open Stock Exchange Hotel has announced that the food and beverage operation will be overseen by Tom Kerridge of the Hand and Flowers. “We’ll be bringing a bit of Marlow up to Manchester,” Kerridge said.

Mains £14-£17. Desserts £5.50-£6. Lunch, three courses £17. Wines from £19 Recently, a chef got in touch with an invitation to review his restaurant. As a come-on, he sent me a photograph of one of his dishes. Boy, was it a looker: emerald green leaves of what appeared to be wild garlic were draped languorously across quenelles of an equally verdant pea purée. There was the promise of fresh morels and dribbles of a glossy jus, placed Jackson Pollock-style in exactly the right places, all of it spiralling towards the middle of the plate. There, the eye was drawn to two meaty cylinders, either beef fillet or venison, seared outside, the deep red of the eruption from a punctured jugular at their eye. You could have put it in a frame and flogged it at Sotheby’s. The big question is, would that plateful be nice to eat? Obviously, I cannot say for sure unless at some point I set to work with knife and fork to violate the visual loveliness. However, long experience has taught me not to get excited. The meat was as lean as Rory Stewart, and without any marbling it risked becoming just a lump of cotton wool protein; an exercise in dreariness and disappointment and tooth grinding. Chefs like these cuts, because they are hard to screw up in the pan and look pretty on the plate. For the diner, or at least for this diner – who, despite the cliché, doesn’t eat with his eyes but with his big fat mouth – not so much. The point is this: the best things to eat are rarely the prettiest. I make a cassoulet, with duck confit and salt pork and rugged Toulouse sausages, which after four hours in the oven looks like a crime scene for a badly thought out body disposal, the duck bones breaking the surface. There’s a Vietnamese chicken dish I make, with lots of fish sauce, soy and caster sugar, that ends up such a deep muddy brown the pan resembles a sample of ploughed field (or something else I won’t mention in a column dedicated to the pleasures of eating). But God, both dishes are a joyous whack of flavour. And so to the main courses at Pasta Ripiena in Bristol, a small Italian bistro from the team behind the popular Pasta Loco, focusing on folded pasta dishes: ravioli, semi-circular mezzaluna, large cappellacci and the like, then bombarded with sauces, as if the kitchen is hiding its homework. It’s all hilariously messy – and brilliantly done. The plates look like paintings by one-year-olds that proud parents stick on the fridge. What’s key here is they have nailed the prime ingredient: the pasta itself. It is that virtuous combination of silkiness and tautness, a wonder of culinary engineering. Each fold holds its cargo perfectly without being heavy or deadening. With that sorted they can get expansive. The best deal is at lunchtime when two courses are £14.50 and three courses £17. In the evenings those pasta dishes alone are around £15 each. Given the care, attention and generosity it doesn’t feel excessive, though it’s clear the bargain lies in slacking off and getting down there in the middle of the day. On a Tuesday lunchtime it looks like Bristol’s finest have taken the hint. The simple wood-lined dining room, with its bench-like banquettes and orange plastic school chairs, is buzzing. That lunch menu offers just three choices at each course and, though there are only two of us, we decide the pricing is conducive to ordering all of it, if only as a selfless service to you, the readers. The darkest of the pasta dishes is the mezzaluna, the folds filled with a mess of ricotta flavoured with black truffle, then buried under a charcoal-coloured sauce of more truffle, wild mushrooms, deep roasted tomatoes and sage butter. It looks like the mulch of a forest floor just before the frosts come, and tastes more intensely of wild mushrooms than almost any other pasta dish I have eaten. Ravioli, filled with sultry brown crab meat, is lightened with mascarpone and chilli, and then buried under a cascade of crisped breadcrumbs, and the sweetest of mussels from Fowey. This triumvirate of dishes is completed by broad cappellacci filled with ground chicken, with a little fiery ’nduja, ground black olives and quarters of charred baby gem. It is one of those rare situations where I don’t find myself mentally ranking the dishes in order of preference. Each one makes a compelling argument for itself. The support acts are equally pleasing, including slices of lacy coppa allowed to come to room temperature, and a golden-crusted focaccia not long from the oven. The starters include three fat Atlantic prawns, charred to black in places, with a heavy lubrication of molten garlic butter. Rip off the heads and have a good suck. It’s where the flavour is. A slab of bread is smeared with “jamon butter”, which are two words that deserve each other’s company, and piled with chunks of taut-skinned red and green tomatoes, dressed with a light aioli. Dribbles of vibrant coloured oils, both green and red, around the plate’s rim, is the nearest they come to artful presentation. The third starter is a dark, sticky caponata with the crunch of pine nuts, the aromatics of basil and a little whipped goat’s curd. At the other end, there is a finely executed pistachio and olive oil panna cotta, made by someone who knows exactly how much gelatin is needed to set this much cream. Eton mess goes on its holidays and comes back much wiser; broken meringue is beaten into yogurt flavoured with rosewater, mint and orange zest. It is small but perfectly formed. The only brow-furrow comes with a Tuscan chocolate torte, which is less show-stopper than heart-stopper. A cherry-sized ball of this, alongside an espresso the colour of night would be a perfect cocoa hit. But this is a whole darn cake. It is unstartable let alone unfinishable. We each take a teaspoonful, give up and order the espressos anyway. Because we are being good boys we don’t hit the mostly Italian wine list, but there’s major choice under £30. Without booze a bill for two people eating as three doesn’t break £70. It will be more in the evening, but I challenge you to begrudge it. There are prettier meals to be had in Bristol. There are certainly fancier dining rooms. But I doubt there are many places which will leave you feeling so well cared for. News bites If Pasta Ripiena is the modern face of the Italian restaurant, then Da Maria in London’s Notting Hill is very much the opposite. In 2017, this tiny caff off the edge of a cinema was saved from closure, and quite right, too. It’s the sort of place that humanises a city. Go for cracking arancini leaking ragù, spaghetti with chilli, garlic and olive oil, and a small bill (87B Notting Hill Gate, London W11 3JZ). According to a new report compiled by Cardlytics, reported by propelhospitality.com, household spend on food delivered by restaurants went up by a massive 19% in 2018. While money spent per individual delivery order has gone up from £18.97 in 2015 to £20.56 in 2019, the amount spent in restaurants per visit has dropped from £21.73 to £19.95. Monsieur Le Duck, the pop-up tribute to the food of Gascony reviewed positively here in February, has a permanent home in London’s Clerkenwell.

Snacks and small plates £3.50-£9. Large plates £18.50-£29.50. Desserts £7. Wines from £20 You wait ages for a toasted cheese sandwich to come along and then three turn up at once. The first was last week, courtesy of the Cheesy Toast Shack in St Andrews where flaked Arbroath Smokie danced off merrily with mature cheddar, amid the tight embrace of quality sourdough. The second was at Owt (“anything” in Yorkshire-ese, but then you knew that). It’s a compact, daytime food outlet inside the Kirkgate in Leeds, the Victorian covered hall from which I used to sustain myself as a student, on a carefully balanced diet of bacon baps. Owt’s schtick is simple: they cook from what’s available on the market stalls surrounding them. The Kirkgate may now have its Istanbul street food operators and pimped hot dog stands, but it is still home to great butchers, fishmongers and greengrocers. The day I went, Owt’s main offering was a crisped and golden cheese and ham sandwich made with the good stuff, the seasoned surface suggesting that it, too, had been buttered before being grilled. There were roasted vegetables, a rocket salad, a cup of potato and herb soup and another of coffee, all for £6.50. A blackboard outside announced that the veg had come from Carlos and Lucy, the meat from Aga and the bread from Bluebird. They also have cake. Lots and lots of mostly vegan cake. And so to the third of those toasted cheese sandwiches: a precision engineered number, sliced so that every angle is at 90 degrees, bronzed in all the right places and filled with the punchy, paunchy umami of blue cheese and caramelised onions. If Owt’s toasted cheese sandwich is a comfortable pair of jeans, this is pure Chanel. And yet it’s merely the support act. It sits alongside an impeccably seasoned disc of steak tartare, full of softness and just the right amount of acidity and piquancy, topped with the sunshine promise of an egg yolk. You scoop up the tartare and nibble on the sandwich, with the certain knowledge that eventually you will slap one on top of the other. It was made for me by Matt Healy, the inked and bearded Leeds-born chef who came runner-up on MasterChef: The Professionals in 2016. His restaurant occupies a space of raw brick, concrete floors, filament light bulbs and nowness, within the Round Foundry redevelopment of buildings from the city’s industrial past, just south of the centre. There’s a huge neon sign on the wall bearing the legend “Food to swear by”. Given that I muttered “Bloody hell, that’s good” over the steak tartare, it’s not wrong. Only I didn’t say “Bloody” or “hell”. What’s intriguing about this dish, and the others surrounding it, is the simplicity. You won’t identify any ideas here that could be described as massively innovative; instead, it is a collection of well-trodden paths, walked with precision and care, and all at an extremely good price. Healy has created a proposition that can work in many ways. At the top of the menu is a list of charcuterie and cheeses, plus a few nibbles for those who just want something with a drink. We get a plate of sourdough which comes with a scoop of pre-whipped Marmite butter for the grown-up child within, alongside a bowl of chorizo in cider, for the adult hovering just behind them. The bread goes quickly because there are too many possibilities to dip it in and drag it through. From the small-plates list comes a plank of smoked eel. It perches atop a perfectly made celeriac remoulade with a mustardy kick. The fish is dressed with discs of pickled radish for crunch. It is in no way radical, but it is special. The sweetest of clams bathe in a wine-boosted broth thickened with olive oil, and handfuls of coriander. Newly arrived spears of asparagus are placed under a translucent shroud of lardo. There is half a soft-boiled egg. These are things that need to be introduced to each other. They get along very well indeed. The simplest dish is shredded savoy cabbage with pancetta and the squeaky crunch of hazelnuts. It’s less a recipe than a great idea. Any reasonable cook could taste it and immediately know how to do it at home. They’ll wish they’d thought of it first. We share a main course of roast chicken with morels, broad beans and peas. At first, I’m a little disappointed. It features two pristine slabs of cream-coloured breast, rather than the darker promise of thigh. Healy knows what he’s doing. The skin is crisped, the meat tastes of something, and there’s a mighty chicken gravy to bind it all together. There is also a little more pancetta, because that can never hurt. It’s a roast dinner governed by the same sensibility that made the toasted cheese sandwich. Throughout the meal he can be seen at the open pass tending to his plates, his big meaty forearms and Captain Haddock beard, a killer disguise for pocketsful of precision, finesse and wit. We drink wine, something crisp and bright from Spain. We are happy. Desserts are the most cheffy moments. Yorkshire rhubarb, from the nearby triangle, brings a scoop of sorbet, which is a disconcerting cassis purple. There’s a vanilla macaron, rhubarb gel and a couple of braised stalks. It’s the only dish that is more admirable than on point. Each element took work, but the finished item doesn’t quite swamp you with rhubarb fruitiness. No such issues with a dark and crisp-shelled pastry tart, with peanut brittle and salted caramel ice cream. It is a plate of shadow and sweetened light. It should be noted that this was all tried in the first days of the first week of an entirely new menu. It didn’t show. It pains me to grouch about anything but I must: the bill carries a service charge, and the card machine then offers you the chance to pay a “gratuity”. “It’s if you want to add extra,” according to our waiter. That’s a little hopeful. I’m going to assume they’ve reprogrammed the machine. It’s a silly misstep that shouldn’t be allowed to stain the memory of a killer toasted cheese sandwich. News bites Anton Piotrowski won MasterChef: The Professionals in 2012, and has now gifted Liverpool Röski, the ambitious restaurant it deserves. Piotrowski’s cooking is built on huge flavours. The ever-changing menu might include sautéed langoustine under breadcrumbs cooked in wagyu beef fat or a meatless red cabbage Bolognese (roskirestaurant.com). In Leeds it’s a sad farewell to the vegetarian Indian restaurant Hansa’s, a trailblazer for the city when it opened in 1986. After 33 years the deft Guajarati chef Hansa Dabhi has decided to retire from the pass, to run a cookery school. Given my sideline at the piano I’m delighted to hear that the notion of dinner and show is going strong. Live at the Savoy is a series of performances over a new menu, inspired by the cooking of Auguste Escoffier, at the grand hotel on London’s Strand where the chef made his name.

Most dishes £5.50-£8; dessert £3; and wines from £22 If you were to make a simple dough with flour, eggs and a little salt and then scrape it into roughly shaped twigs, straight from a wooden board into a pan of boiling water, perhaps while singing folk songs to yourself about lascivious goat herds and lusty maidens, you would soon see them rise to the surface. At which point you might agree that they looked just like tiny sparrows in flight, bobbing there in the water’s rumble and turn. Or, as they would call them in the Swabian dialect of High German, they would be spätzle, those endlessly comforting rugged noodles found across Bavaria, Austria, the South Tyrol and a few points further east. You would also have an explanation for the name of the Spärrows, a Lilliputian venture tucked away down a lane near Manchester’s Victoria station. While it is named after the translation of the word spätzle, its interests lie with the wider family of dough-based products: with ribbons of pasta and dumplings many and various. It is one long middle finger thrust towards the entire keto diet lobby. If you don’t do carbs, do not come here. If you think gluten is the enemy, do not come here. If you disapprove of cheese, do not come here. If you are joyless and miserable, with lips that are liable to fall into a fleshy knot resembling a puckered arse, definitely do not come here. The rest of you, get in. Is it the kind of food you would want to eat every day? No, unless every day your main meal is followed by a long lie down. But sometimes in a complex and brutal world, when we are assailed by idiots and ideologues and stupidities of every stripe, this is the food we need to make everything right again. The Spärrows occupies a converted railway arch opposite the site of Umezushi, the small Japanese restaurant I enjoyed very much back in 2016. They took over this arch to create a prep and development kitchen and perhaps a deli. One of their sake suppliers, the Polish-born Kasia Hitchcock, convinced them the front space would be much better used as a carb-fest of a restaurant with her chef partner Franco Concli in the kitchen, investigating his Tyrolean heritage. There is space here for a dozen diners, if you don’t mind getting cosy. But then this restaurant is all about getting cosy. If you come here for lunch, dispense with breakfast. The menu starts with a list of sauces to go with their spätzle and gnocchi, though if you choose anything other than the braised onion and cheese to go with the spätzle, Hitchcock will politely suggest you are out of your tiny mind. We do indeed have the spätzle with a mess of long-braised onions, cooked down to that point where they are trying to decide whether their future lies in being a purée, under an armed assault from gruyère and emmental. The noodles look pleasingly like white worms, in their thick glossy overcoat. For £6 you get a generous plateful. I challenge you not to finish every last strand. Any leftover sauce can be mopped up with pieces of their airy-crumbed focaccia, just freed from the oven. As well as ravioli, the fillings for which change weekly, there are both Russian and Polish dumplings. The latter, the pierogi, are sizable items, heartily stuffed with minced wild mushrooms and sauerkraut. I am even more taken by the pelmeni: small, dense dumplings filled with minced veal, and then covered with breadcrumbs fried in garlic butter. Here, there is a little international cooperation. As they’re working alongside colleagues from the Japanese restaurant across the road, the breadcrumbs are panko and all the better for it. I begin to understand why large Polish men can be moved to tears by a plate of dinner. I also understand why I spend all that bloody time in the gym, treating the stair machine as my confessional. The Spärrows is where I want to eat; the gym is where I repent. The most expensive dish, at a vast £12.50, is a Tyrolean goulash: hunks of beef braised until they are only maintaining their integrity out of good manners, in a glossy gravy that a city like Manchester properly understands. It’s served with both chopped gherkins and silverskin pickled onions, with a few spätzle for company. We are heading into summer, but it’s deepest winter every day at the Spärrows. Alongside all this we have their sauerkraut, served at room temperature. Theirs will make you look anew at the very idea of fermented cabbage. It is crisp and bright, and is spun through with pumpkin seeds and ribbons of carrot. Fermenting has become such a cult that it’s easy to forget it need not produce something designed to bash your teeth out. This is soothing and delicate. At the end there is a list headed “Coffee and Cakes” including the legend “Daz’s Wife’s Brownie”. Daz is their postman. When they opened, he suggested they try some of his other half’s baked goods. It was a good steer: the icing sugar-dusted crisp surface gives way to a soothingly gooey centre. There is a thimble-sized bowl of custard to dip it into. There is also tiramisu and a chocolatey panettone. Alongside this Hitchcock offers us coffee, served black. I don’t for a moment think to object and say I want it with milk. What Hitchcock suggests is what we get. She is quite the conviction host, in the loveliest way. The wine list is very short but supplemented, rather gloriously, by sakes because, well, that’s what Hitchcock does. She may also try to get you on to the brandies and liqueurs. Don’t look at me for advice. I’m not your mum. This is a labour of the right sort of love, which means it is not perhaps the fastest place to eat. If you go, bring your patience with you, it will be rewarded. Right now, its home on Mirabel Street is a bit of a nightmare to access. Massive building works mean you have to go literally round the houses to find it; brilliantly, their response to this was to introduce a cooked breakfast including pickles, spätzle and smoked sausage. Now every morning they are full of builders, calorie-loading for the day ahead. In truth, you don’t need to be a manual labourer to eat at the Spärrows. But it probably helps. News bites The Spärrows is a new arrival; St Moritz is anything but. It opened on Wardour Street in London’s Soho, in 1974, making it one of the capital’s great survivors. Their spätzle are served with bacon, cabbage, cheese and cream. Move on from that to one of their famed fondues, for two, including the classic Neuchâteloise. Slip quietly into a cheese-induced coma (stmoritz-restaurant.co.uk). Once upon a time, Kettner’s was one of the great democratic restaurant options in London’s Soho. You could eat cheap pizza under shimmering chandeliers. Then it became a more expensive brasserie, before being taken over by the Soho House group. They promised to keep it open to everyone. No longer: the restaurant is now only open to Soho House members and hotel guests. A couple of weeks ago, I reported that chef Aiden Byrne of Manchester’s Restaurant MCR was to launch the Metropolitan Bar and Grill Rooms in Liverpool. Not any more.

Small plates £3-£8.50, mains £11-£8.50, feasting £40-£70, wines from £15 About an hour into our dinner at Träkol, one of my companions sits back. He surveys the outrageous platters on the table and says: “I think this may be my new favourite restaurant in the whole country.” It’s a big bold statement, but it’s one I can get behind. Träkol, located in a nest of renovated shipping containers tucked under the Tyne Bridge on the Gateshead side, is not some colonically irrigated, Botoxed and depilated gastro palace. It’s not going to wrench you through the torture garden of faine daining. It’s something so very much better than that: a ragingly modern restaurant determined to feed you with the seriously good stuff, until you slump back and say, enough already. Google Translate tells me that träkol is the Swedish for charcoal; if it’s wrong, go argue with the algorithm. Certainly, it makes sense. The kitchen, located behind a glass wall to keep from smoke-curing its diners, is dominated by a huge charcoal grill. So yes, another live fire restaurant, but one with serious intent. It is the food end of a smart operation collectively called the By the River Brew Company, run by Dave Stone and Rob Cameron of Wylam, a 30-barrel microbrewery in Newcastle’s Exhibition Park. There’s also a cycle repair unit out back and at weekends, a market down the banks of the Tyne for street food operators. Shortly, more converted containers will come into use for restaurant pop-ups. Both the website and the menu vibrate with buzz words: not just “live fire” but “fiercely seasonal” and “nose to tail”. Meat is dry-aged in a room lined with salt that comes from the Himalayas. Well, obviously. For once it all amounts to something. Take a dish like the grilled pork jowl with XO slaw from the small plates list. At first it looks like the pungent coleslaw, rendered a shade of amber from its Asian dressing, has been laid on toast, until you cut in. Now you clock that the burnished slabs underneath are pieces of crisped, salty pig cheek that have been slow-cooked then seared. It’s one of those dishes that you think about when you wake up the next day. From the same list, tomatoes are salt-baked to intensify their flavour, cooled then layered with slices of pink lamb heart. Those turn up on toast, sodden with sweet tomato juices and salted anchovy. There are thumbnail-sized surf clams, opened over fire before being pelted with fermented black beans and red chilli. You suck the sweet, salty clam meat off the shell and then keep probing with your tongue for all the other good stuff tucked away in there. Happily, they can also do delicate, allowing Lindisfarne oysters to sing under a bright Nam Jim dressing of lime, fish sauce and chilli. Or you can have them baked under Montgomery’s cheddar. It’s a tricky thing to pull off. Montgomery’s is a bruiser of a cheese. It could easily overwhelm the oyster, especially if you let it spend too long under the grill. They don’t. The sea and the dairy hold hands. But the real fun lies under the heading “Feasting”. Take Middle White Pig. You get two platters. On the first is a 1kg chop, charred outside, slightly pink within, with thick discs of black pudding, its exterior crisped. There are caramelised apples, a watercress salad and grilled potatoes. The other platter brings half a pig’s head. (If you don’t like to be reminded that meat comes from animals with ears and noses, move on to the next paragraph.) The skin is crackled to within an inch of its life; oh how I love the sound a pig ear makes when it snaps. The meat underneath is soft and sweet. And the price for all this? £40. Allegedly it’s for two and I’m sure the management don’t want me to argue, because they need the orders. But I’d be quite afraid of the two people who could finish this by themselves. Bring a friend. Let them hang around for the whole grilled turbot. It takes serious skill and nerve to grill a beautiful fish like this and get it right. The skin is grilled to that curious place between gelatinous and crisp. The pearly fillet underneath slides off the bone with a nudge. It is fish cookery of the first order – and a lot of it for £55, which is £10 less than at Brat in London. It comes with new potatoes, and peas braised with bacon. (They will do you a single serving of turbot for £20.) There are six of us booked in to eat tonight: most of the panellists and producers of Radio 4’s Kitchen Cabinet. We are probably the crew of terrible people you most don’t want to see turn up in your lovely restaurant without due warning. If so, they do not flinch. Tables are pushed together to make room. Advice is given for those who want it on the long list of beers, with names like Weizen My Ass, Tangerine Tart and Broken Dream. Almost all of them are offered in small and large measures. There’s also an encouraging wine list including a 2017 Albariño from Rías Baixas for an extremely good value £26. In London it’s usually £40+. Because there are six of us, and the two feasting dishes are meant for four, we also get a cauliflower steak seared on the grill and enthusiastically seasoned with shawarma spices, plus a thick cut Barnsley chop with cockles, seaweed butter and samphire. This is called over-ordering, but how were we to know? There are desserts, but there isn’t even a discussion around our table. We are done. For the record, the desserts on offer are a plate of wood-fired figs with caramelised brioche, or a sundae of salted caramel, chocolate and peanuts. If you make it to those, I’ll be impressed. The nearest thing to a quibble is over their Reuben sandwich fritters, which are tasty enough, but don’t hit us with the flavours of sauerkraut, Russian dressing or Swiss cheese. Look. I’m working hard to find a niggle. But by now you should have got the message: Träkol is a place you want to eat in. Just go with enough people to do it justice. News bites I’ve already referenced Brat in east London, on account of their way with turbot, but Tomos Parry’s live fire cooking goes far beyond that star dish, to take in the likes of Herdwick mutton, whole mallard and serious pieces of beef. Do not miss his chopped egg salad with the salty hit of bottarga, or his game sausage with blood pudding and beans, a rustic dish in high heels (bratrestaurant.com). The soup company Yorkshire Provender has launched a product designed to raise money for the homelessness charity Centrepoint, based on a competition winning entry by home cook Omero Gallucci. 20p from each pot of the red pepper and chorizo soup, available in Waitrose, will go to the charity as part of their ‘Big Broth’ fundraising campaign.

Snacks, starters, charcuterie and cheeses £4.50-£14. Mains £16-£36. Desserts £6.50-£8.50. Wines from £19 Being a journalist is a licence to ask outrageous questions. A notebook in your hand is a badge. It says: I am not asking you about this sensitive matter because I am nosy, but because my job demands it. Now tell me again, you did what? With whom? And exactly how much Swarfega was involved? Not long after I took over this column 20 years ago, I concluded that a notebook and a restaurant table were the perfect combination. People relax when they are eating well. Then they talk. This has been proved to me time and again over the past couple of months as I’ve taken a bunch of starry names out for lunch, fed them well and asked them those outrageous questions for a new podcast. You will want to know that Richard E Grant, who is obsessed by smells, practically buried his nose in a bowl of white truffle pasta at Sartoria, and inhaled; that Stanley Tucci shared with me the pain of failing to roast a pig’s head adequately, while eating at Locanda Locatelli; that Mel C suggested ordering all the desserts at the Brasserie of Light. And if this sounds like I’m shamelessly plugging my wares, of course I am. I had lunch with an actual Spice Girl and two Oscar nominees, plus a whole bunch of others besides. I’m not keeping quiet about that. Pompette in Oxford’s Summertown is where you should take people if you want to get them to confess to almost anything. It is the kind of classic French restaurant that the British middle-classes adore, which makes them feel secure and happy and understood. In Summertown they have hit the mother lode. Here they are, mostly the elders of the tribe spending money on themselves rather than their grown-up kids, poring over a menu of dishes they recognise from holidays in the Dordogne and their now dog-eared copies of Elizabeth David. They are cosmopolitan and worldly and open to the new. But sometimes what they need is culinary reassurance. That’s exactly what Pompette supplies. The name roughly means “tipsy”. Come here and become what the name says. The chef is Pascal Wiedemann, who worked at Henry Harris’s Racine, before opening Terroirs near London’s Charing Cross. He and his wife Laura came here last October to a space of bare brick walls, banquettes and polished floorboards. It probably required little more to transform it from a previous incarnation than the hanging of a few French prints and the adding of the letters “te” to the word toilet. Open up the knife roll, get in the ingredients and go. One side is a designated bar area, with its own menu of charcuterie, cheeses and terrines, which old hands from Terroirs may recognise. Here are pork rillettes and saucisson de Montagne, Morbier and Brillat-Savarin. Our waiter made a feeble attempt to suggest we weren’t meant to order any of it on the restaurant side, but I reassured her it was in addition to, not instead of. I wasn’t going to miss out on toast, thickly spread with cool butter, then laid with tiny rings of shallot and slinky ribbons of salted anchovy. We were given a bowl of the Lyonnaise favourite cervelle de canut – fromage blancs with herbs, shallots and fighty cider vinegar – to dredge crackers through as we made our choices. We order a whole globe artichoke, with the thistle removed as it should be, accompanied by a substantial bowl of vinaigrette made with dollops of nose-tickling mustard. A deep, plunging bowl of fish soup, the colour of copper pans polished to a shine, is the distillation of the bits of fish and seafood we leave behind. You do not need to ask whether there is gruyère and croutons and garlicky rouille on the side, because here they are. Pile one atop the other then catch them on your spoon before they sink into the depths. A snowy piece of hake arrives atop a pile of Umbrian lentils, half a roasted lemon to one side. The edges of the fish are the same colour as the soup; the skin is crisp. Thick-cut lamb chops, which have been given a proper seeing to by the grill, are smeared with more salted anchovy, melting in the heat. There is purple sprouting broccoli because we must all have our greens. The lamb leaks its juices into the mess of anchovy and vice versa. This is cooking which makes its mark not through invention and fireworks, but by pressing into service knowledge of the classics and extremely good taste. Each dish arrives. You check it over, realise that everything is as it should be and return to your conversation. Stay for dessert because they’ve made the effort. An impeccable disc of meringue, piped into the curls and curlicues of Georgian cornicing, is filled with whipped cream and piled with candy pink rhubarb and bright green pistachio nuts. A sizable cream-filled choux bun with a crunchy caramel glaze is surrounded by griottine cherries and presented with a jug of hot chocolate sauce. Yes, and please. There’s a strong choice of wines by the glass and half-litre carafe, starting at a reasonable £19 a bottle. Put that together with their three-course fixed price lunch menu at £20 and Pompette can be good value, though there’s no pretending: the main menu pricing is robust. After all this is Summertown, where the media lot and the university lot and the bookish lot live. Here the only things that are free are opinions. Starters meander around the £10 mark with mains at a little more than double that. The bill will mount up if you go for it. Then again a place like this is worth saving up for. A few months back I came to Oxford and rolled my eyes at a hotel which traded off complacency and the apparent acquiescence of its customer base. It’s a delight to return to Oxford and find the good stuff. I would have enjoyed engaging the people sitting around me in conversation about Oxford’s curious restaurant sector, but they were far too busy interrogating each other. That’s what good restaurants are for. News bites For a totally different Oxford experience try My Sichuan, located close to the station. Meat eaters should not miss the crisped lamb ribs with salt, chilli and cumin, the fat hot and running. There is pork belly braised long and slow in soy, on a bed of Chinese cabbage to make you feel better about yourself, and a whole sea bass Chengdu style, under bean curd and a sauce of chilli and garlic. Mr Thomas’s Chop House in Manchester permanently changed its name earlier this month, just in time for International Women’s Day, to Mrs Sarah’s Chophouse, in recognition of Mrs Sarah Studd and her daughter Sarah who ran it from 1875 to 1901. The women were trailblazers at a time when women weren’t even allowed inside such venues as customers (mrssarahschophouse.com).

No one wants this role; it simply befalls them. Chivvying people is a pain in the bottom, an endless WhatsApp onslaught of quibbles and variables, as folk chip in that they’re allergic to coriander, can do Tuesdays only and, “Will there be vegan cheese?” To assist these situations, I always pay note to catch-all places such as the ebulliently named Happy Face and SuperMax, which appeared late last year on the ground floor of the Everyman Cinema in Kings Cross, central London. The cinema, by the way, is a different kind of wonderful: they’ll bring a bespoke chocolate sundae or a passionfruit daiquiri to your sofa while you watch an arthouse movie, although the cost will cause some people vertigo. Happy Face is decidedly more cheap and can’t-knock-it-down-cheerful. It’s from the brain of terribly clever restaurateurs and rebel-rousers Spiritland. You may have heard about their first project just down the road and, more recently, in the Royal Festival Hall. Spiritland are serious about music – very serious: the sound system is reputed to be world class. It’s the type of place to take anyone who would be excited by hearing A Love Supreme by John Coltrane played in its entirety on a Kuzma Stabi XL2 turntable. Happy Face, on the other hand, is a place to take anyone – your friends, your gran and your difficult colleague Linda who likes only Pizza Express. It’s my reckoning that if you can’t spark even a glimmer of joy in the notion of a capacious, all-day, retro-feel, pocket-friendly joint with a small menu of Italian classics, cocktails and vermouths, and with a subterranean bar (the SuperMax part) playing thrusting, forgotten Europop, well, do you really deserve a meet-up? Happy Face has 130 covers and sits invitingly inside a building painted millennial pink, or perhaps Pantone rose quartz. Mood-wise, the restaurant is a sort of space-age slant on a classic Neapolitan pizza joint by way of Arnold’s Drive-In from Happy Days. And, yes, they do do milkshakes. Food-wise, the key is simplicity. A smattering of antipasti: good Nocellara olives, generous piles of calamari fritti, hot, crisp zucchini fritti matchsticks, a wobbly burratina or a plate of salumi. Then a choice of seven pizzas at between five and 10 quid a throw. The choice is gaspingly brief. No faff, no fuss. Let’s be honest here: with pizza, we are all creatures of habit. Choose a margherita, a funghi, a calabrese or a pepperoni, then, if your heart desires, add other extras – mozzarella, prosciutto cotto and so on – from a side menu rather cutely titled “Extra Happiness”. Word of warning: controversially, there are no pineapple chunks available in “Extra Happiness”, possibly to avert fights. Happy Face’s dough is fermented for 72 hours, which makes, they claim, the crust lighter, fluffier and easier to digest, although as a northern child in the 1980s, I ate even the hardest bread crusts, hoodwinked by the idea that they caused leg-growth. Happy Face also offers gluten-free dough and non-dairy cheese, so everyone, regardless of how special they are, can erect something glorious of their own volition. My abiding memory of Happy Face is the ice-cold sgroppino cocktail made with lemon sorbet and prosecco, which would work equally well as aperitif, antipasta or dolce; they make a decent negroni, too. The parmigiana pizza is a good, sloppy-enough, chewy-enough, sating mass of parmesan and aubergine on a rich, tomato base. We added a generous fistful of mushrooms and pushed it into our heads with several glasses of montepulciano. For pudding, there is tiramisu and revolving daily choices of gelato, although we opted for the bombolone cioccolato: two hot, freshly sugared doughnut balls with a dish of melted, orange-infused, dark chocolate to dip them in. Yes, just like Terry’s make it. If by this point you can still stand up and sway, head downstairs to SuperMax, a late-night bar with a custom-made disco ball centrepiece, velvet wall hangings and cosmic oil projectors. Happy Face and SuperMax are not reinventing the wheel, but they are reacquainting us with the idea that good restaurants can also be born out of simplicity. In a landscape of ticketing, table-turning, high concepts and rumours of forthcoming “price surge” menus, I am down with easy. If you’re happy and you know it, clap your hands. • Happy Face 14 Handyside Street, London N1, 020-3146 0760. Open All week, noon-11pm (Sun 10pm). About £20 a head, plus drinks and service.

Chefs are really dramatic people. However, the opening of Alchemilla in Nottingham is a gargantuan feat by any measure. Alchemilla lives below-ground in a crypt-like space, formerly an abandoned coaching house on the Derby Road. The premises sat unloved and festering for more than 100 years, full of rubbish and rot. It was the sort of loveless hell portal over which Kevin from Grand Designs might become quite animated. Especially if chef Alex Bond had told him he planned to spend part of spring 2017 renovating the place himself. But I rejoice in people who have this type of vision. Because now Alchemilla is quite gorgeous. It’s a sort of House Stark Game of Thrones vault with a capacious, open brushed aluminium kitchen, serving a veg-centric menu, that’s not remotely vegetarian, sitting at least two miles outside the main Lace Market area to which Nottingham tourists generally flock. The sheer chutzpah of it all meant I felt warmly to Alchemilla even before I ate a bite. Bond has worked previously in places such as 42 The Calls, Auberge Du Lac and Restaurant Sat Bains, but this feels very much his bid to fly unfettered, creating a sort of semi-fine, fermentation-focused, Japanese-influenced, feasibly Michelin-star-luring experience. I say this is “semi-fine” because although lunch is a minimum of five courses and service is definitely bright, drilled and knowledgeable – dishes appear, are briefly explained, then guests are left alone – there is a definite level of chunkiness about some of Bond’s food. An opening course, for example, called “potato cooked in seaweed, fermented garlic and smoked cream”, I felt dead sure would be a teensy squirrel’s egg cup full of titivated new potato. (Listen, it’s not my first time at the posh restaurant rodeo: I’m not expecting actual WHO-recognised sustenance.) But no – I take that back, because at Alchemilla I was brought a fist-sized baked spud drowned in smoky, salty, sea-herby sauce. I cannot say it was perfect, but like all beautifully prepared carbs covered in cream, it was certainly compelling. I ate it like a just-hatched creature you’d watch on a nestcam. Another course featured an entire healthy-sized enoki mushroom, lying on its side like a winded millipede, draped over duck mousse. I think of this dish often due to its wonderful oddness. The enoki was plated like something one might find on a beach and alert the coastguard about. It was delicious: buttery, earthy and oddly meaty. This, I mused, is what chefs should mean when they utter their current mantra: “I want to make vegetables the star of the show.” Because what that usually translates as is: “I have steeped a single broccoli floret in chicken consommé – give me 100 quid.” I tackled the spud and the enormo-shroom with a glass of Lebanese red, while very much loving Alchemilla’s Chateau Ksara tasting notes, which explained it as “forest floor”. I didn’t love everything at Alchemilla. Imperceptibly cured salmon, topped with an oyster, wrapped in wafer-thin cucumber and perched on an emerald puddle of cucumber gooiness, all together felt a little like anonymous mush. Then, a cubic stack of thinly sliced seasonal veg strewn with gremolata left me equally blank-face emoji. But the menu has shifted a lot since my visit. Bond’s main affair for meat-lovers, however, is still on the jukebox: “LDF lamb”, a dainty autopsy of saddle, pencil fillet and belly served with a small aubergine baked in miso, then glittered up with sesame seeds. You will never forget that aubergine, I promise. It’s an assertive little number. My high point was the lemon tart. Or a suggestion of one, if what you’re hoping for is an entire wobbly slice. Alchemilla’sversion is as big as a matchbox, yes, but it’s a glorious tickle of baked, verbena-laden custard drizzled with Manni olive oil and served with frozen yoghurt. I left full, cheerful and determined to come back again. Alchemilla feels to me like a restaurant at the start of a long and important journey. This huge, reclaimed, re-loved space, recently rid of a century of moss and memories, needs to bed in and make its own history. Bond and his exceptional team looks as if they’re having the time of their lives testing the boundaries of Nottingham’s dining scene. It’s not perfect, but it’s exciting. I’ll take the latter any day. • Alchemilla 192 Derby Road, Nottingham NG7, 0115 941 3515. Open lunch Wed-Sat, noon-1.30pm; dinner Tues–Sat 7-9.30pm (6pm Fri &amp; Sat).

I say “partial”, because the front section, Hicce, is the new restaurant by Pip Lacey, ex-head chef at Angela Hartnett’s Murano and very much a rising star on the British food scene. Hicce is a modern British, woodfire-focused, seasonal restaurant. It’s pronounced “ee-chay”, by the way, and not, as I said the first dozen times, “hicky”, meaning something you notice on your neck the morning after heavy petting at the school disco. Regardless, it was really the Wolf &amp; Badger part of the name that troubled me, because this suggested that the restaurant was inside a shop; and not only that, but one of those shops full of fashionable items such as gorgeous, £198 “statement scarfs” that you hope might change your life, but just leave you exactly the same, only poorer and with a more colourful neck. Restaurants in shops are generally awful – built by committee and with half the team concerned with things such as preserving footfall to the watch counter. They’re a corporate solution to empty space. Hicce, I’m thrilled to say, avoids these pitfalls completely by being an entirely separate entity, and a beautiful one, too, with its own front door and a wide, welcoming staircase. It has the feel of a capacious, repurposed Manhattan loft, although everything within a square mile of Hicce has been repurposed. If you’ve not been to the King’s Cross area for, say, five years, then forget everything you know – the grot, the greyness – and imagine instead a brave new, ever-expanding pleasure acropolis just behind the station, filled with brasseries and boutiques and cobbled piazzas, with fountains and a Waitrose that holds live jazz sessions. The newest stage of the new King’s Cross is Coal Drops Yard, which is now home to 50 or so “curated” brands residing among the elegant Victorian brick walkways. Hicce, a word that people say means “current”, or “of the moment” in Latin (although I’m sure Guardian readers will have other theories), presently serves the likes of wild red prawns, cured salmon with wasabi, miso chicken thighs and a delicious slant on deep-fried brussels sprouts with hazelnuts and kohlrabi. Rarely do I ever reply to the server’s question, “Do you need help with how the menu works?” with a “Thank God, yes, please”, but at Hicce they are keeping things interesting. The upper portion of the menu is divided into “charcuterie”, “cheese”, “seafood” and “jars” – tapas-type small plates, if you will, except that those jars are filled with pickled things such as mooli, cabbage and beetroot. The second section is “hot sticks”, which are skewers, in sets of two, with one option being broccoli with tangerine. The bottom part of the menu is split up into the more commonplace “veg”, “fish”, “sides” and “meat”, although each dish is a cacophony of new flavour combos: mackerel with kumquats”, squid with apple pork collar with reblochon. This, then, is one of those menus where the only option is to grab its tufty collar and hang on, as if you’re riding Falkor in The Neverending Story. I say this in a generous sense, because I liked Hicce very much. The cocktails are marvellous; the new, young, bright-eyed staff are warm and attentive; they play house music all night long, and there’s a bar curving through the room that I’d happily sit at and eat beer bread, a plate of sprouts, and one of Lacey’s magical, life-changing muscovado creme caramels, and drink several glasses of Fior de Cassia Frizzante. Still, I know that others might find Hicce challenging – charred broccoli hanging on a skewer with bitter tangerine is, at best, divisive. Hicce’s charred fresh mackerel with radicchio and kumquats is an enjoyable, bittersweet slap across the face. Cheeses are a rouelle, an alex from Germany, and a soft, sharp gorgonzola piccante, although being served them as an opening course may bewilder. There’s joy in the fact that Hicce doesn’t care. Lacey’s creme caramel has quickly jumped into 2018’s not-to-be-missed dishes for London gluttons, which is ironic, because it spent years as a beige, retro lump on a dessert menu that marked a diner out as tragically safe. Lacey shows us its enduring appeal with a stiffly set but seductively yielding yellow pudding. It is a sweet bowl of 70s shtick and modern-day swagger, and you will be more relevant with every vanilla-and-caramel-syrup-laden spoon. I’ll watch this restaurant grow with interest. This is one “hicce” I don’t regret having. • Hicce Coal Drops Yard, London N1, 020-3869 8200. Open all week, noon-11pm (Thurs-Sat midnight, Sun 9pm). About £30 a head, plus drinks and service.

Starters £5-£6.50. Mains £12.50-£16. Desserts £5-£7.50. Wines from £24 Let’s dispense with the preamble and get to it. A bowl arrives filled with watercress, all deep green leaf and stem, hung with fragile rings of lightly pickled shallot. Almost buried by the foliage are lumps of bronzed and golden debris. They appear deep fried, these misshapen pieces. It is vice and virtue clambering into bed and seeing what they can learn from each other. And so you dig in. Some of those pieces are salted croutons of sourdough, the crust shattering beneath teeth, courtesy of a run through bubbling oil. They are crunch to their heart. Some of them are pieces of the very best pork crackling, the glassy unblistered stuff with a just a little of the mouth-coating stickiness of gelatine. The menu will tell you this is crispy pig’s cheek, but you don’t really mind which part of the animal they come from. There is the pepperiness of the watercress and the softness of those leaves and the acidity of a good dressing. It is an adult bowl of food designed to make those with encouraging appetites sigh and perhaps weep a little with happiness. Maybe that’s just me. It costs £6. The crispy pig’s cheek with watercress was merely the highlight of a hugely cheering meal at EartH Kitchen, the restaurant of a major new arts venue in London’s Hackney. I don’t know what the capital H is about, and I don’t care. They can call themselves Hairy Baboon’s Arse for all I care, as long as they carry on serving their big muscular dishes, at these prices. The restaurant occupies a broad, hard-edged space, made more intimate come evening by low illumination and the gutter of tea lights. Those of a certain age should be prepared to power up their iPhone torch to read the menu. Live with it. Anyone who eats around will recognise in certain key references – to ox heart or wild garlic, to Swaledale lamb or capers or hefty British cheeses – the butter-smeared palm prints of Fergus Henderson’s St John. Head chef Chris Gillard was previously in charge of the St John group’s kitchens. This kind of food, a distinct form of modern British cooking, full of robust flavours and nerdy intent, is clearly his religion. Other restaurants and chefs bang on about being ingredient led. The Benign Order of St John Chefs mean it. Their food is never pretty. Once you’ve used the torch, put that camera phone away. Your friends would only squint at each photographed plateful and mutter “WTF?” or “Is it a crime scene?” You will not need photographic proof to tell them you ate very well indeed here. Your enthusiasm will do the job. In the small plates list, all priced around £6, greenery dominates. We have a salad of sweet-salty brown shrimps with the crunch of mandolined kohlrabi and bitter leaves, again under a sprightly vinaigrette. That ox heart is sliced thin and jerk spiced before being seared. It is mixed in with more leaves and pieces of long-roasted aubergine and the high waft of fresh mint. What’s striking about these dishes is the way meat is used less as focus for the plate, and more as a flavouring. Then there are spears of purple sprouting broccoli, lightly charred and liberally slathered with a Dijon mustard dressing. It’s a version of that old stager leeks vinaigrette, after it’s engaged a personal trainer, taken off the gum guard and learned a few moves. There are half a dozen main courses in the low to mid-teens, including a “Ridley Road” vegetarian curry, so named because the ingredients come from that street’s market nearby. The most expensive, at £16, is a whole roasted pigeon. It arrives on a fiery heap of roasted carrots, and spiced red peppers cooked down until they have collapsed into a gloriously happy, flame-coloured mess. Those vegetables are worth the price of admission by themselves. But with it comes the pigeon, cut in two, and laid across the support act. The meat has the high funk of game that has been properly cared for. This is what pigeon should taste like. Too often it doesn’t. If that sounds scary, order the grilled kipper. It’s a bit of old-fashioned English, high tea cookery, delivered by guttering candle light. It’s the kind of dish Fergus Henderson would refer to as “sustaining”. It fills the plate and is curled over itself. It’s laid on a billowing pillow of mash, which is there to take your hand and soften the whack of salty smoked fish. There is a dollop of grain mustard on top for acidity. There are leaves of hispi cabbage underneath. Desserts have a classy school dinners vibe to them. If that doesn’t appeal cut straight to the cheese. They have Wigmore and Dorstone from Neal’s Yard. Otherwise, there is a “rhubarb torta della nonna”, which is a glamorous, “look at my Chanel shades” name for a pie of sweet, slightly heavy shortcrust pastry with a creamy filling. It could have done with a dollop of cream to move it along. There is also a steamed ginger pudding with a marmalade butterscotch sauce, and they’re not kidding about the marmalade. For here comes not just citrus, but a familiar bitter kick. It is one for the adults in the room. This does come with a scoop of vanilla ice cream which softens the blow. Service is engaged and keen without being weird and stalkerish. My only whinge is over wine pricing. While there are some intriguing choices – I freely admit to not being previously familiar with the wines of Greek Macedonia – it kicks off at £24 and then quickly heads north of £30. It is certainly possible to find a good Gavi de Gavi that does not cost £50. One word of warning. This is the restaurant of an events venue, the entrance to which is down a few stairs from the dining room. The tables are sparsely occupied when we arrive at 8pm. At 9.30pm, the 700-seater space next door kicks out, and suddenly it’s completely rammed. It looked like they got everybody fed and watered in reasonable time, but if you don’t want to get caught in the rush make sure to check what’s on. That programme includes a number of Guardian Live Events, which connection in no way influenced this review. But having eaten there, I can safely say my employers have extremely good taste. News bites Rochelle Canteen at the ICA on London’s Mall is an offspring of the east London original and is associated with St John. One of the chef partners is Margot Henderson, Fergus’s wife. It’s a white-washed room – all the action is on the plate. Recent menus include an oxtail and pickled-walnut pie, radishes and cod’s roe, and butterscotch ripple ice cream (arnoldandhenderson.com). The New York based baker Dominique Ansel, creator of the cronut, is clearly wise to British tastes. He has just started offering rhubarb and custard flavour soft-serve ice cream, from his Belgravia store. It better be good; it costs £6.50 to take away and £7.80 to eat in (dominiqueansellondon.com). Plans have been submitted in North Yorkshire for a vast high-end ‘food-agri park’. The £250m Future Park, to be built near Harrogate, will be run by Italian food hall chain Eataly. It will occupy 188 hectares and feature both restaurants and food outlets, though much of the land will be agricultural. It should open in 2022.

It is both two miles and a million miles from there. Turn left just after Waverley station, keep going until the bagpipe howl of The Green Hills of Tyrol fades into traffic noise, and soon you’ll come across The Little Chartroom, a relatively new, decidedly bijou, nautical cartography-fixated and almost-fine-dining restaurant. Not definitely fine dining, as in “staff in white gloves wheezing in your ear while wrestling with cloches”. Instead, this is the sort of fine dining where modern French-British, seasonally focused plates are precisely hewn and the dinner options are brief but meaningful. Three starters, three mains and, if you perch at one of the four seats at the bar (which you may need to, because there are only 18 covers in total), you can survey the construction of, for example, an intricate caramelised onion tart with a bitter leaf salad. Several of you may by now be saying: “But in Leith?!” Now, I won’t go so far as to say that Leith is going through regeneration, but The Little Chartroom is certainly part of an era of reappreciation and, yes, the pedigrees of chef Roberta Hall (ex-The Kitchin) and front-of-house Shaun McCarron (ex-Castle Terrace) would have been possibly more likely to be channelled into a quaint joint somewhere up near the castle, possibly within earshot of that man who paints his face Braveheart blue and yells all day for tourists. Hall and McCarron have instead set up shop in a location that was a soupçon more earthy, and they got married barely a week before they opened its doors. Just like all marriages, this restaurant is a leap of faith spurred on by the spirit of joint adventure, and it’s one you cannot help but wish well. I went on a Saturday evening to find the place gently buzzing with chatter and, crucially, every seat filled. Word has spread about The Little Chartroom; it is by no means a secret, and I sense that by next year’s festival season, the place may well be elegant bedlam. Is it perfect for everyone? Not at all. How could it be? Some may receive in bewilderment a tiny starter of richly smoked breast of wood pigeon sat beside four slices of sweet poached quince and strewn with a squirrel’s fistful of crunchy, crushed almonds, and exclaim: “Where’s me dinner?” The same goes, too, for my delightful, albeit brief onion tart, which some may regard as canape-sized. This riff on a tarte à l’oignon alsacienne was a mush of sweetly stewed onion sitting on a crisp pastry podium with a white mushroom (singular) sliced perilously thin and arranged with Sistine Chapel-esque precision as its lid. Personally, small portions do not bother me, but then, I would say that, wouldn’t I? I’m literally paid to consume endless dinners. Any evening that doesn’t feature the urge to take off my skirt and hand it to the maître’d is a boon. The tart comes with a pretty, neat salad of chicory and walnut. My main was a beautiful piece of cod, browned on the skin, fleshy beneath, sitting on an acutely tidy bed of lightly charred romanesco, plus a Basque-style pipérade made with stewed red peppers and topped with pink fir apple potatoes. Hall’s cooking is unique, delicious, risky and completely remarkable. I am a new and avid fan. A venison dish was a decadent plate of mostly brown things: tender venison haunch, some with bone attached, heart and lung spliced up into a feisty haggis, roast celeriac and an occasional pan-fried brussels sprout. But, for me, puddings were the real stars of the show. You may feel differently, but it’s hard to quibble with a thick slice of soft malt loaf smeared with soft Swiss vacherin, drizzled with sticky mead and topped with freshly shelled hazelnuts. The dish had the simplicity of a midnight fridge buffet, but with Michelin star-worthy swagger. Hall’s toffee cake with lemon curd was also outstanding. Its listing on the menu did it no justice; this was an actual slab of sponge, possibly the most generously portioned thing on the menu, littered with charred marshmallow, caramelised popcorn and fir-flavoured ice-cream that was the exact Venn diagram intersection of “exquisite Italian gelato” and “waking up face down in your Christmas tree”. You eat all of these things in a room where the walls are filled with nautical maps. It’s early days for The Little Chartroom, but it has safely left the harbour and has sailed straight into my heart. • The Little Chartroom 30-31 Albert Place, Edinburgh EH7, 0131-556 6600.

You won’t want to leave’ – restaurant review','Parker’s Tavern, University Arms Hotel, Regent Street, Cambridge CB2 1AD (01223 606 266). Starters £7-£16, mains £14-£26, desserts £5-£8, wines from £20 Cambridge is a city of furrow-browed intellect, which is why it needs a restaurant like Parker’s Tavern. It is a dining room where the most fundamental of emotions are tended to. Our lunch begins with a version of poutine, the Montreal classic of chips under a magnificent armed assault by cheese and long-braised meats. It ends with a build-your-own ice cream sundae, looking like something from a children’s picture book. In between is a display of extremely assured, confident cooking designed purely to please rather than to dazzle. As a result, it is its own kind of dazzling. It’s a decade since I last reviewed Tristan Welch’s food, at Launceston Place in Kensington. Back then he was a young man, hunkering down in London’s culinary trenches, determined to win an imagined war to prove he was as cutting edge as any Japanese multi-layered blade. He had ideas, technique and clever bits of kit. He was damn well going to use all three. It felt like he was cooking for gongs rather than his diners. Mackerel fillets came with both foams and pickles of cucumbers. Lobster arrived with a soup of green cobnuts. A frozen bitter-lemon parfait was forced to make friends with a thyme sorbet. It was impressive and, ultimately, exhausting. And all this in a softly carpeted, downlit room in subdued shades of grey, which made you feel like you were in an expensive Swiss clinic, where crisp-linened nurses did things to you with well-lubricated tubing. Parker’s Tavern, inside the re-invigorated University Arms Hotel, is a different matter entirely. A version first opened in 1834, but this is very much a new proposition and here no one will interfere with you. It looks like a cross between a gentleman’s club and a Parisian bistro. There are banquettes in blood-orange leather. There are wood-block floors, wood-panelled walls in gun-metal grey hung with vaguely interesting prints, acres of white tablecloth and airy views across Parker’s Piece, from which the restaurant takes its name. You will imagine coming here for a quick bite; you won’t want to leave. It’s not just the menu, which walks a jagged line through both British chophouse classics and something rather better travelled. It’s the nerdy attention to detail. The meaty sauce with those chips has been fretted over, possibly for days. Sizeable cuts of beef went in; only fragments remain. There is an edge of piquancy, and something else, too, which turns out to be unadvertised lardons. Not mentioning pork products in your beef sauce? Blimey. That’s bold. Our waiter apologises profusely when I raise it. I tell him I was merely curious; that unexpected outbreaks of pig are never going to distress me. Others may be less sanguine. Likewise, I suspect there will be purists who will eye-roll their way through the dish complaining it’s not poutine because it doesn’t have cheese curds (fresh milk just coagulated with rennet). Frankly, I think the melting tumble of aged cheddar used here is very much more the thing. From the more restless part of the starters list, there is a whole quail, given a seeing-to by a crimson tandoori marinade so good it would get the nod from the Pakistani grill houses down London’s Whitechapel Road. It is a bold punch of roasted spice, garlic and ginger. I eat the bird with my hands until my fingers are stained red. Underneath is a rugged dal, alongside ribbons of cucumber in a yogurt dressing to cool things down. From nearer home comes an impeccable fish cake, far heavier on fish than cheap fillers. But what makes it – and the other two dishes we try – is the lake of sauce. Welch’s kitchen has a killer line in luscious, sparky butter emulsions; the sort that brings velvety lubrication to the most grinding of days. This one has the glorious detail of finely chopped boiled egg alongside the capers and parsley. I’m suddenly overcome by the urge to pipe a roaring rendition of Jerusalem, so I can stand and salute it as an emblem of all that is good and true. But then comes a main course of chicken blanquette and now I want to bend the knee. It reads like an old stager but here it is shiny and new. Instead of the stew the word blanquette suggests, it’s a couple of braised legs, scattered with shavings of black truffle. There’s a pillow of mash so soft and luxurious you could put a baby down on it for a nap, and then another stupidly encouraging cream, butter sauce with just the right punch of acidity. And if this meal is starting to sound like it should come with a side order of statins, followed by a gentle chat with a dietician about life choices, it isn’t experienced like that. This is largesse, delivered daintily. The fish of the day is skate wing. Clearly, it has been given the same care as everything else. It doesn’t so much slip from the cartilage, as obligingly curl itself around your fork. Naturally, there is an impeccable beurre blanc. Next time I come – and there will be a next time – I am gagging to try the crab, brown shrimp and smoked mackerel cocktail, the macaroni and lobster gratin in a thermidor sauce, and what is knowingly listed as “classic British beef spaghetti Bolognese” because the real thing has sod all to do with Bologna... We finish with a Duke of Cambridge tart with a set filling flavoured with citrus and brown sugar. And then there is that ice cream sundae, built in pencil strokes from your own checklist. Two scoops or three? Raspberry ripple and double chocolate you say? Oh, and some soft serve, too. With caramelised popcorn and thick whorls of salted caramel sauce. And a couple of spoons, because by God I’ll be needing a friend to help me with this one. If I have a niggle, it’s about the uneven pricing. The overall bill, while sizable, doesn’t feel unreasonable for what’s going on here. But those starters are generally a chunky £12 a pop; then again most of the mains are only a couple of quid more. Just come here knowing you’ll get what you paid for. Parker’s Tavern feels like the restaurant of a chef who has learned to relax; to channel all that skill, technique and good taste towards pleasing the crowds rather than impressing his peers. I am delighted to be part of the adoring crowd. News bites The restaurant of the Painswick, a 16-room hotel in a lump of old Cotswold-stone manor house in Gloucestershire, has a similar clubbable vibe as Parker’s Tavern. The menu takes in baked beetroot with burrata and pig’s head with romesco sauce. The text on the website still makes as little sense as when I reviewed last summer, but don’t let that put you off (thepainswick.co.uk). Chef Nico Simeone, who has made his name in Edinburgh and Glasgow offering regularly changing tasting menus, is taking the idea to Belfast. Six by Nico Belfast will offer a different six-course tasting menu every six weeks with each one being themed by location or idea. It will cost £28 a head. Naturally, it will be in the city’s Cathedral Quarter. Amid the drifts of new cookbooks heading our way, one stands out to me as being very much for our times. In April, Christian Stevenson, AKA DJ BBQ, brings us The Burger Book. Apparently, he’s managed to get 160 pages out of that.

At Market Halls in London’s Victoria, a spanking new, all-day modern food court, these notions are writ large. Market Halls was once the nightclub Pacha, but this gargantuan three-floor space has been gutted and filled with permanent stalls selling vivid purple, ruby prawn dumplings, fancy udon noodles and bespoke salt beef. On the Saturday lunchtime I went not long after opening, the place was mobbed, and mainly with the under-30s. Nightclubs such as Pacha are also growing as scarce as first-time mortgages, so it was perhaps destiny that these two things should blend. This is the generation after mine, who missed out on Carol Smillie compelling them to spend every spare penny on Crown Paints and cornice pieces via BBC1’s Changing Rooms. Instead, this lot are eating vegan falafel from a place called, cough, Fanny’s Kebabs, and looking like models while they do it on Instagram. I’m not entirely sure who is winning. And yes, there is avo toast at Market Halls, available from a healthfood joint called Squirrel, but there are also custard baozi from Baozi Inn, silken noodles from Koya Ko, salt beef sandwiches from Monty’s Deli and flaky, buttery roti from Gopal’s Corner, as well as tacos, fish and chips, posh kebabs, fancy pasta and three bars selling cocktails. The list of vendors is lovingly curated – it’s none of your riff-raff – which is a dog whistle to, well, people I like to call foodies simply to aggravate those who hate the word foodies. Foodies, mainly. Foodies are a specific breed, because they will scan the list of vendors at Market Halls Victoria and know that Koya Ko is an offshoot of Soho’s beloved Japanese noodle cafe Koya, and that Gopal’s Corner is a new chance to try Roti King’s legendary roti canai, for which a queue forms out of the door from 5pm every night at the Euston original and the dish I specifically went to Market Halls for. I wanted a fresh, soft roti and a bowl of fragrant, heavenly dal. We also tried the minced beef-filled roti murtabak and some boldly flavoured chicken peratel. The dal is a compelling concoction that gets under your skin and drifts into your dreams at 3am, convincing me to pop back for lunch on my own some time soon, because I am a special sunflower who deserves it. I want the kari laksa and mamak mee goreng, too. There is a simplicity and sincerity in what Gopal’s Corner offers. I feel similarly about Koya Ko’s tempura atsu-atsu, a bowl of world-class, pale, slippery, fat udon in a classic, deep, heart-drenching dashi broth with an enormous tempura prawn plonked slightly ungraciously on top. I keep thinking about the crunch of the delicate, vaguely sweet batter mixing with the rich, umami broth. We also greeted a reuben (salt beef, sauerkraut, swiss cheese) from Monty’s Deli like the familiar friend it has become over the years since Mark Ogus and Owen Barratt’s beginnings at Maltby Street Market. There are several things about Market Halls that I find lovable. Yes, it’s is a souped-up food court much like you’d find in any shopping mall, and with only marginally comfier seats replete with those buzzers that flash when your chips are ready, which you then have to fetch yourself on a tray, as if you’re in Strangeways. And, yes, it’s £11.20 for udon with mackerel and £9 for a glass of not-very-good wine. But this is a wholesome, multipurpose space that serves decent food, that your gran would enjoy visiting, and where you could meet a new mum with a baby. It’s somewhere you can reserve space for office drinks and be sure people can line their stomachs. Music is unobtrusive and there are no naff TVs playing rolling news. You could meet as a rabble and turn up in dribs and drabs, a bit like we used to do with pubs. Remember them? Best of all, you can eat alone as a single person without serving staff taking bets as to whether you’ve been ditched via Tinder or Bumble. Market Halls has already taken root in Fulham and in Victoria, and will do so soon on Oxford Street; it also has plans to open in York. I’ve seen what Generation Z will do instead of going to nightclubs. Give them a break. Let them eat avocado. • Market Halls 191 Victoria Street, London SW1 (no tel).

Starters £9-£17. Mains £21-£32. Desserts £9. Wines from £29 Following a major car crash, there’s usually an investigation to work out what caused it. Was it driver error? Or perhaps environmental factors? At some point, the people behind Yeni, a newly opened import from Istanbul to London’s Soho, may wish to conduct such an enquiry. Because right now it really is a pile-up; the sort that leaves debris scattered across all three lanes, and slows the traffic on the other carriageway to the speed of spilt treacle as they decelerate to get a serious gander. I am going to exonerate the young team working front of house, who deliver both their script and the often calamitous dishes with a touching grace. Also, I have huge respect for the general manager, who retained a certain dignity when the fire alarm went off and continued to roar at us for a good few minutes. Oh, how she punched that number pad, her fingers moving like she was performing a Liszt piano concerto. For us, the siren came between the main course and the dessert. Even someone as godless as I am is allowed to mutter about the possibility of divine intervention. Maybe this alarm would make dinner stop. But we stayed. It’s called commitment. They’re probably wishing we hadn’t. So no, it’s not the staff working the room. Instead, one must look to Turkish star chef and newspaper columnist Civan Er, whose Istanbul restaurant Yeni Lokanta has won many awards, and his business partner Cem Bilge. But I also sense the dead hand of a consultant; someone who implored them to bring their faux-rustic schtick to Britain and charge what the hell they like for it, “because those Londoners will swallow anything”. Yeni weds underwhelming, occasionally disastrous dishes with the kind of in-yer-face pricing that gives the entire restaurant business a wretched name. The problem isn’t that we are used, in the UK, to Turkish food being seriously good value, although it usually is. The many smoky grill houses with which the Turkish community has blessed us, heavy with the scent of rendering lamb fat, are a joy. Nor is it that we look to Turkish food for simplicity. During the many summers I spent in Turkey I fell in love with the kebabs and crisp-crusted lahmacun served up at Fethiye’s bus station cafés. Still, there’s always room for a more evolved take on such a culinary tradition. And yes, here’s the dining room for it, with its Aegean turquoise tiling, its hanging globe lamps and its white brick walls which are almost as distressed as we are by the end. The sad thing is, they never do give us anything evolved or diverting. Brows start furrowing early when we are told the two of us should order three or four of the starters, mostly priced in the mid-teens, plus two main courses. We are also told “these dishes will arrive one by one”. We are at the mercy of the kitchen. It starts oddly. Turkey has a thrilling way with breads. There are puffed up, sesame seed-crusted flatbreads, and rich, springy oval loaves and more besides. All of that has stayed firmly in Turkey. In common with almost every restaurant surrounding us, they have bought in some serviceable sourdough. We tear at it disconsolately. Now comes an inoffensive taster of a doughy filled dumpling on a yogurt-based sauce dotted with herb oils. It’s a study in beige, and tastes beige too. These tiny dishes are an opportunity to smack us with flavour, to get us excited. Perhaps they don’t want to get our hopes up. For here come wide ribbons of olive oil-braised celeriac. It’s completely fridge cold, and dotted with brutally acidic bits of unadvertised, coagulating sheep’s cheese. It tastes like something left over from the night before, which may just have had its moment 12 hours ago. After a lengthy break in which we are presented with a dish we didn’t order, quickly taken away, we get a small disc of beef tartare for £16, with a potato croquette filled with liquid egg yolk. It might have worked if the beef hadn’t been minced to such a paste it could be embraced by someone without the benefit of their own teeth. Again, it is served overly chilled. A kind of relief comes in a cheery dish of scallops with a spiced carrot purée and a dollop of sprightly herb sauce and walnuts. On the one hand the scallops are well cooked, the sauces engaging. On the other, there are only two scallops and it’s £17. Ah yes, those damn prices. The nadir is the £21 charged for a huge slumping package of muddy-grey vine leaves filled with chickpeas, the sour, bile-ridden tang of labneh and more leaf mulch. I stare at the dish, then mutter to my companion: “We’d better get the vet in; that cow’s not right.” We try to eat it, really we do, but it’s less food than a traumatic experience designed to be character forming. It departs the table looking like a rugby field at the end of a vigorous game on a wet winter’s day. Apparently, the star dish is the “roasted beef ribs, isot pepper, cumin, sourdough”. It reads well, as it should for £26. I’ll have to take their word for it on the roasting. What arrives are ravaged strands of the sort that come with long braising, seemingly mixed with quantities of sticky jus. The other flavourings are obscured. Beneath is a tombstone of now soggy bread. It’s a Turkish dish, but one apparently from that bit of Turkey just to the west of the Pennines. It’s the kind of thing a Lancashire pub would slap on the menu for a tenner and for which we’d all applaud. Nobody is clapping now. There are just two desserts: a mediocre salted-caramel panna cotta, and some tiny custard-filled doughnuts, which are fine. Both cost £9, which is not fine. The short wine list has nothing below £29. Bizarrely, despite Turkey having a robust wine sector, there’s just one Turkish bottle, as against three from Greece. I don’t want to stoke tiresome regional animosities but I do wonder what they’d make of that back in Istanbul. The rest of the list, mostly priced at £40 or more, is European. At the end, a fellow diner further along the communal table we are clinging to tells me he reads these reviews and senses, “this one will write itself”. It didn’t. I had to do that. But Yeni provided all the material. News bites Yeni’s arrival fits with the growth in places offering food from around the eastern end of the Mediterranean. Yotam Ottolenghi’s Rovi, in Fitzrovia, does it very well, and is bang on trend with both live fire cooking and fermentation. It’s an omnivorous menu but vegetables star. Try the sweetheart cabbage with salted anchovy, and the celeriac shawarma (ottolenghi.co.uk/rovi). Carluccio’s is to trial a more ‘formal and premium’ evening service at its branch in Richmond, south London. According to CEO Mark Jones, they will introduce new tableware and up the vegan offering. This follows the closure of 35 sites, under a company voluntary agreement (carluccios.com). A few Louisiana-influenced restaurants are marking Mardi Gras. Newcomer Bayou Bar in Tooting is holding a crawfish boil on 5 March. Meanwhile at Jacob Kenedy’s Plaquemine Lock in Islington there’s live music, special menu items and a general ‘party vibe’ on 3 and 5 March (facebook.com/bayoubarlondon; plaqlock.com).

These chilled sesame, cucumber and coriander noodles had sounded like balm to my noodle-enthusiast ears. Noodles in any form are my downfall, you see. Leftover takeaway ho fun noodles, for example, sat in my fridge overnight, will whisper to me at 3am: “Graaaace, Graaaace, don’t sleep. Come downstairs. I am your breakfast.” These noodles at Nonya, however, had me stumped. This was a tahini-flavoured mulch with a large, wasteful fistful of coriander flung on top – less of a garnish than a hedge. Two other dishes I’d been recommended to order – the laab and the Chinese burger – were both unavailable that day, too. Self-pity is the only option as a restaurant critic, because be sure no one else will gaze at your gilded life and sympathise. There are no sad charity appeal ad breaks on daytime TV, in which David Tennant pleads for £5 a month to keep me in Gaviscon and Spanx. But if there were, he’d tell you of experiences such as Nonya, whose reputation had lured me 400 miles from my sofa, arriving optimistic and starving, only for the joy to ebb from my soul with each new dish. Nonya could be loosely described as a casual-dining, sort-of Peranakan restaurant with a downstairs cocktail bar. Perenakan is Straits Chinese cuisine, a blend of Malay and Chinese food that makes great use of braising, stir-frying and ingredients such as galangal, turmeric, coconut milk and lemongrass. It is currently experiencing, they say, a culinary renaissance, in as much as anything that people have eaten since the 16th century can be proclaimed to be “having a moment”. That said, Nonya also has an array of Thai dishes on offer, alongside Malay-ish and Chinese-esque stuff. Fans of new-ish British Thai-influenced scene-stealers such as London’s Kiln and Som Saa will see a, cough, tribute here in the loud music, sparse decor and street-food-style small plates. Those searching for large oval platters heaped with pad thai, baskets of prawn crackers and swan-shaped napkin origami will be disappointed. Still, the crux of the matter is that chef-restaurateurs such as Kiln’s Ben Chapman are ripping up the rule book in some ways, playing loud MC5, and serving a mish-mash of Burmese, Yunnan and Lao recipes with glasses of Menard Le Rouge, but there is still a lofty precision to, say, his clay pot-baked, celery leaf-infused brown crab glass noodles. Nonya’s food, on the other hand, is much more rudimentary. Two hefty, gelatinous green bean and garlic splodges of flat dumpling appear. One has collapsed and started oozing its brown innards before it reaches me. Perhaps these dumplings make perfect sense on a Friday evening after several pandan-flavoured Black Star cocktails, but in the cold light of day, they’re a mess. A plate of rojak tauhu – tofu puffs in a bland peanut sauce with slices of cucumber – is unloveable. Johor-style lamb curry arrives with a pleasant, albeit lightly spiced gravy and a few lumps of requisite soft potato. In my head, I’m already making excuses for Nonya. I had heard that it can be wonderful, but is also inconsistent. Some swear by the place, visiting often, while others leave bewildered. I’d clearly chosen a bad day. Plus, the Sunday menu is a reduced version of the midweek one, and was on this day further reduced by stock shortages, so perhaps without tasting Nonya’s “son-in-law eggs” – crispy fried boiled egg in tamarind sauce – or even its crowd-pleasing nasi goreng, my opinion was indeed null. But the truth was, I was trying my damnedest to eat lunch here, throwing money at this problem, and achieving very little. Sloppy braised aubergine with silken tofu and far too much Sichuan pepper was a puzzling experience. A plate of crisp chicken wings with fish sauce and chilli were a riff on the chilli fish sauce wings at Chapman’s Smoking Goat, which he freely confesses to have borrowed with love from Pok Pok in Brooklyn. Nonya’s wings are crispy, true, but all their sauce had slid off into a congealed puddle on the plate. At this juncture, I called time on lunch and ordered a deep-fried peanut butter and condensed milk sandwich and a large glass of Ailala Treixadura. Both were thoroughly magnificent. Fusion cuisine such as Nonya’s will always be a game of chance, but deep-fried sugary carbs and booze are always a surefire winner. Trust me, I’m an expert. • Nonya 10 Claremont Street, Glasgow G3, 0141-221 6200. Open all week, noon-10.30pm. About £20-25 a head, plus drinks and service.

Each time I tell the story, it becomes hazier, more grandiose, but the core of the memory remains intact. I recently went on a road trip to Cornwall and ended up at 8pm on a Friday night in a dark, single-room cafe-bar with 20 covers. The chef pushed a mauve, B&amp;Q-style 1980s bathroom tile into my hands, on which words like “Rabbit + Scurvy” and “Sea-trout + Cuckoo” were written in block caps with Magic Marker. This was the menu. Seven dishes. Of what, exactly, it was unclear, because they keep their powder very dry. Between courses, I hung with the smokers in the adjacent courtyard and cuddled the restaurant’s resident bedlington terrier. Or, rather, attempted to cuddle, because the hound was clearly so widely loved by visitors that benevolence fatigue had set in months back. The Kitchen’s pudding course, named simply “Toffee Apple”, turned out to be a Jackson Pollock-style dirty protest of black pepper, caramel, chervil panna cotta, rhubarb compote, brittle toffee, flecks of butterscotch mousse, chocolate, fennel, apple and cumin puree, and at least half a dozen other sweet, bitter and umami components. It was at times orgasmic and at others deeply unpleasant, like a good marriage. I sat for hours drinking Trevviban Mill rosé and watching chef Ben Coxhead work quietly in a small, prison-cell-like space, plating fried, golden-skinned gurnard on to a perfectly balanced warm pear compote. And his fabulous asparagus dish: three varieties sitting in a buttery, onion-apple broth. That rabbit with scurvy turned out to be Thumper from Bambi served on scurvy grass, a vitamin C-rich, mustardy cress that was apparently given to the sailors of yesteryear. Whenever I tell this tale, people say, “Hang on, and this is in Falmouth?” To which I reply, “Yes, Falmouth – you should go!” Although, whenever I recommend The Kitchen, I always wonder if chef Ben has, by that point, been noticed by Michelin or been hounded out of the south-west by furious locals who stopped by for dinner and didn’t get anything they envisaged as such. No side of spuds on offer. No basket of bread. Not even a salt shaker. Instead, small portions of exemplary local produce served with unabashed weirdness. You eat this all as it’s ready, and in no particular order, using 1970s cutlery on what looks like your gran’s best china, and sitting next to a shonky bookcase that looks for all the world like a lending library while your hair gets blown about by loud Stevie Nicks and Jefferson Airplane. You might still need chips on your way home. You’ll either love The Kitchen or you’ll hate it: it could go either way. Still, restaurants such as this in British seaside resorts make my heart burst with happiness. I had arrived in Falmouth at the four-star St Michael’s Spa hotel to discover that it was largely a building site. The reception desk made no mention of the honking, cement-speckled elephant in the room as they handed over our key card and suggested we have dinner in their soulless dining space, The Flying Fish. This throwaway example of disappointment says so much. “Let us underwhelm you,” British tourism says so frequently. “It’s not as if you’ll be back!” But places such as The Kitchen excite me, because there is a genuine, heartfelt attempt to wow the palates of those dropping by. There is no sea view, which is how Cornwall masks terrible cooking. And, yes, I do mean you, the Godolphin Arms in Marazion, with your two tiny, cremated croissants. Meanwhile, The Kitchen is a dark space serving strange, possibly challenging plates of rare venison flecked with vivid cerise beet mousse – part dinner, part crime scene. My scrawled notes say that “Salty Fingers” are like samphire and apparently grow on Cornish cliffs, and that “Scurvy” isn’t actually very pleasant and I’d understand if pirates and sailors possibly preferred to suffer gum disease. The notes go on to say that chef Ben, like all the best cooks, rather enjoys leaving diners befuddled. And that The Kitchen is one of the most fantastic, albeit wonky, boho and flawed restaurants I’ll visit in 2018.

Some of us knew it just from Blue Peter, but others dared to dream and visited on school trips. My main memory is that the Jorvik piped in fake authentic dung smells, which, for a coachload of kids from Cumbria, was something of a busman’s holiday. But I am here to announce that York now has a fresh star attraction, one that’s also steeped in history. Roots was formerly The Bay Horse, a gargantuan boozer dating from 1893, which has been tastefully renovated in muted shades by chef Tommy Banks and the family-centric team behind The Black Swan at Oldstead. The Banks family’s first project is famed for being TripAdvisor’s “best restaurant in the world”, a rare example of TripAdvisor churning out the merest nod towards common sense. And, latterly, The Black Swan has been famed for Banks himself, a winner of Great British Menu, a posterboy for British hospitality, and an earnest, avid proponent of local ingredients, passed-down family recipes, tips and techniques, and of generally doing things properly. Roots is a chance for both Banks brothers to spread their wings a little farther, with the wonderful, personable James in charge of front-of-house. This is also perhaps a chance for them to geek out even more intensely on seasonality. Roots, with a Noma-esque swagger, revolves around three distinct seasons. Presently it is “Preserving Season”. The summer months are, rather gorgeously, “The Time of Abundance”. Then, from January until May, when little fresh produce is harvested, comes “The Hunger Gap”, although I doubt anyone will go hungry here, because the Banks’s entire ethos centres around forward-planning and finding ingenious ways to squeeze taste and sustenance out of every square inch of the family kitchen garden. In Preserving Season, James appears at your table proffering rich, earthy Crapaudine beetroot stewed slowly in beef fat, topped with curd and cut in a triangular slice so that, to all intents and purposes, it ends up looking like a piece of Black Forest gateau. It is fiendishly delicious, too. Each dish arrives with a tale that reveals James’s palpable relief that they’re getting to “use up” things: their beet stores, their apple stocks and the family’s onion mountain. This makes you feel as if you’re helping out with a noble cause merely by stuffing your face. Crisp seed crackers – feats of art – and fresh sourdough arrive with Lincolnshire poacher custard. Yes: bread with custard. It is a carb combination your body didn’t know it needed. We eat heartily, noting many more hits than near misses. Smoked eel piped into tiny doughnuts sitting on a blob of apple were interesting rather than delicious, but fresh, pink cured trout on a vibrant fennel kimchi was delightful. A bowl of turbot in cream with chopped strawberry may sound nightmarish but, as fans of The Black Swan will know, it is so very wrong that it tricks the tastebuds into it being 100% right again. Fresh kale – crunchy and bitter – dressed in a tart-ish sheep’s yoghurt with hazelnut may not be to everyone’s taste, but it would be a hard heart that would not love the buttery skate wing with a souped-up tartare sauce and a scoop of Lilliputian shoestring potatoes. For me, Roots was one of the loveliest lunches of 2018, with interesting wines by the glass, including a pear ice wine from Herefordshire, and a list prettily and cleverly illustrated to show grape varieties and flavours. The devil, as in all the best restaurants, is in these precious details. Do not skimp on pudding: in fact, go speedily to pudding if your appetite is meagre. The roasted rye and carrot caramel shortbread is a name that gives nothing away of its ethereal splendour. It looks like a trifle and it tastes like a Terry’s Chocolate Orange – it is Christmas distilled, and I can’t stop smiling for thinking about it. The apple cake with creme fraiche is a bewildering treat – moist, crunchy and laced with honey from the family’s hives. I was in York for four hours and didn’t think of the Jorvik Centre even once. The Banks family have set up shop on Marygate. They have come, I feel, to make their own history. • Roots 68 Marygate, York; no phone. Open Weds-Mon, noon-2pm, 5.30-8.30pm (last orders).

I wish I could reveal something more wholesome, but hype will put more bums on seats and napkins in laps than a new opening’s deft seasoning or fancy produce suppliers. At the all-new, 250-seater Din Tai Fung in London’s Covent Garden, those shadowy voices of hype said we should expect an opening-week queue of five hours. In December, on a busy, pre-Christmas tourist thoroughfare, bring a cagoule and stay hydrated, because the queue for its xiao long bao and salted egg custard lava buns will feel like the sort of war of attrition from which Stephen King could milk 500 pages. Hype of the level surrounding Din Tai Fung, I must stress, is not created simply by paid public relations teams. Clearly they help, but real, giddy hype will always be something of a perfect storm. Din Tai Fung is a global chain that specialises in Taiwanese dumplings and Huaiyang cuisine. The company has made moves on London in a swaggering – albeit politely swaggering – manner by commandeering two enormo-restaurants in the eye-wateringly expensive real-estate zones of Henrietta Street and, soon, Oxford Street’s Centre Point. What’s less easy to decipher is why Din Tai Fung is “cool right now”, which would require a spider-chart with quantitative variables on youth trends, shifting demographics, plus some lemming-attracting pixie dust. On opening week, I got a table by being incredibly un-British and stalking past the queue, repeating, “Excuse me, excuse me”, in a purposeful, diligent manner that suggested I really should be inside the building. It’s a trick that can go two ways: you can either eat early or you can be taken down like a tighthead prop in a vicious dump tackle. This time, I was lucky. Din Tai Fung’s decor will divide diners. You will either revel in its sparse, non-luxurious simplicity, the cheap tables, the Ikea glasses and the hollow acoustics. Or you may feel as if you’re in the dining room of a last-minute two-star Costa Brava hotel that you booked half-board but by day three are loth to eat in. The path to your table takes you past a glass-fronted workspace filled with dumpling technicians, all wearing surgical masks and white laboratory coats, standing in groups of five, and filling, weighing and primping xiao long bao, shumai, jiaozi and so on. Sporadically, one of these white-coated, faceless and almost inaudible workers will totter, Pingu-style, to your table laden with a stack of baskets. This is either charming, or a bit like feeding time at a medical trials centre you signed up for to settle your gambling debts. We ordered the classic pork bao, in delicate, accomplished, neatly pinched dough with 18 tiny puckers. To taste, they’re pleasantly inoffensive, neither obscenely soupy nor intensely flavoured. We took the pale green, vegetarian jiaozi, which are pretty to look at and filled with brown, umami-flavoured mulch. A side of black, waxy, soy-drenched wood-ear mushrooms with ginger in vinegar were peculiar yet compelling. We wanted the prawn and angled gourd, but there was none. We wanted crispy wonton, but there was none of that, either. Almost everything fried on the menu was unavailable, as were all the desserts – the sweet steamed buns filled with red taro or chocolate lava, or any of the jellies, rice or mango puddings. This, I mused, might be a handy thing for one of the managers, of which there are about 17, to go and tell the people queueing for five hours outside. Here is the rub about hype: there would be nothing at all wrong with Din Tai Fung if you popped in one day, unbesmirched by pre-bluster and expecting nothing. In that case, you’d slurp the dumplings, make a crisp, delicious golden prawn pancake disappear and perhaps a bowl of wobbly wontons in chilli oil, maybe even some bland, white noodles in a puddle of spicy sauce, and leave feeling pleasantly sated. You would observe the aesthetically splendid bowl of prawn and egg fried rice with some gratitude for your lot as a fed, watered, sheltered human being. But, no, you were caught up in hype, so now you can’t accept anything less than being shot in a rocket to the Cantina bar in Star Wars, where the dumplings are served by magical unicorns that lick the oldness off your face between plates, leaving you more youthful by the time the bill arrives. Anything less than that is a letdown. I will return for my pudding when the hype fades, the influencers get bored and the buzz moves on in no more than 12 weeks. Trends come and go, but fickleness never goes out of fashion. • Din Tai Fung 5-6 Henrietta Street, London WC2, 020-3034 3888. Open all week, 11am-10.30pm (10pm Sun).

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(444,'2018-05-18T12:00:58Z','Bodean’s restaurant review | Grace Dent','At a recent sojourn in Bodean’s, I was slapped again by a fact about the “casual dining crunch” that most industry experts never mention: diners voted with their feet. The food got too bloody casual. Chains like Pizza Express, Prezzo, Jamie’s Italian and myriad others presented themselves as friends: there to do the heavy lifting on your social life and family occasions. And they abused that friendship. My love for Pizza Express dwindled over a dozen missing-in-action side salads; the waiter eventually brought me undressed leaves. And I am still murderous over a night in 2012 trapped at Prezzo in Aldeburgh, Suffolk, where the microwave’s ding heralded bolognese resembling the innards of a Whiskas beef-flavoured casserole pouch. Yes, Britain may arguably have grown more skint over the past decade, but its palate has become more refined. We’d rather eat Lidl prosciutto at home than have it hurled at a sharing “plank” by a surly teen in Jamie’s Italian, Guildford. Back in 2003, Bodean’s was one of the only places in the UK serving pseudo-authentic American “barbecue”: pulled pork, babyback ribs, burnt ends. These days, though, weddings, small festivals and your child’s school fete may well feature a street-food truck flogging marinated, faux-Tennessee piggy bits. And that street food will be brined, marinated, smoked, shredded and seasoned with a hell of a lot more love and attention than Bodean’s, which transpires to be some of the worst slap-dash nonsense masquerading as hospitality I’ve ever endured. And I’ve eaten fajitas that tasted like Clarks Polyveldts while sat in a big, stationary, fake New York taxi at a shopping-mall TGI Fridays. The clientele are duped tourists and potential incel freedom fighters bulking up on protein. My labrador would not have eaten Bodean’s cremated babyback ribs, and that stupid hound will wolf down fox poo with vivid glee. Does Bodean’s care about this? Or will it rumble on until it’s turfed out of the market, when it will be everyone else’s fault, including you and naughty me? Bodean’s ribs put me in mind of when Daenerys Targaryen’s dragons go out of control in Game of Thrones and aerial-bombard the local goats. My “Cajun swordfish” emerges in such a blackened state that I could have used it to bang out a rudimentary Afro Left by Leftfield. The fish is served with a mountain of overcooked okra and cherry tomatoes. The chips are McCain’s-style, served dry and dusted with some sort of sweet, not entirely offensive hickory flavouring. The coleslaw is unseasoned, loveless mulch. I ordered a side of “Cajun vegetables”, which turned out to be more okra. I’m not certain if anyone, historically, has ever consumed an entire kilo of okra in one sitting. The Bodean’s menu offers no vegetarian option save for the ubiquitous mac’n’cheese. It’s 2018. Go mad, guys. Stick a box of beanburgers in your trolley. You can’t mess them up more than your burnt ends that taste of jam and have the consistency and vibe of something a kidnapper might begin posting back to your parents. Still, if Bodean’s profits begin to suffer, be sure we will endure industry rumination about this wholly perplexing affair. I ordered a banana split because, by this stage, I had drunk two rather strong old-fashioneds on a nearly empty stomach. The first because I love an old-fashioned, the second to blot out the bartender’s Nikki Sixx bandana. The banana split is very dear to the heart of British diners of a certain age. It evokes memories of 70s and 80s childhood largesse. It should, by unwritten culinary law, involve a banana, cream and ice-cream, yes, but more than this: sprinkles, and drizzled sauces in raspberry and chocolate flavours. I will accept a glacé cherry. If you have a sparkler, I want that sparkler lit. I don’t care if Aunty Sheila loses an eyebrow: this is about me. The Bodean’s banana split is a passive-aggressive act. It’s what you give a bad child on their birthday if they have recently drop-kicked a guinea pig. It’s just a banana covered with squirty cream. While Instagram rocks with freakshakes and bespoke cronut-duffins catering to a Bake-Off showstopper-spoiled audience, over at Bodeans they’ve created the perfect post-Brexit banana split. It’s 1944 again and we should just be excited to see a real-life banana. Bodean’s version of barbecue is a great example of how the casual dining game got so “crunchy”. I shan’t apologise for getting all up in its grill. • Bodean’s 10 Poland Street, London W1, 020-7287 7575. Open all week, noon-11pm (10.30pm Sun). About £25 a head plus drinks and service.

Into a landscape strewn with bitter fights about authenticity, Red Farm has flown its lurid Pac-Man dumplings. A Pac-Man made of tempura sweet potato, standing bolt upright and gob open, chases four multicoloured, plump, shrimp-stuffed dumpling ghosts across a white, oval plate. Go on, take a photo. Everyone else does. Red Farm is not the elegant, solemnly genuflected A Wong in Victoria, which serves Chengdu street tofu, tea eggs and Yunnan province cheese. Nor is it Jen Cafe in Chinatown, which slings jiaozi to the purists in surroundings so humble that 20 minutes feels like a good long sit. No, Red Farm is a different dumpling entirely. This is Covent Garden, downwind of the jugglers and fire-breathers, and Red Farm, next door to New York compatriot Balthazar, is all decked out in red gingham, a blink-and-you’ve-spent-two-hundred-quid on-cheeseburger-stuffed-dim-sum restaurant where they play Jodeci, Bell Biv Devoe and various new jack swing. The walls are whitewashed, the chairs pine and the theme, if anything, Willy Wonka’s farmhouse. If any of this makes you balk, then probably don’t go. It’s not as if Red Farm doesn’t set its stall out as big, daft, delicious fun. Chef Joe Ng’s menu features his beloved, signature pastrami egg rolls. They take rich, gelatinous Monty’s Deli pastrami, saute it with veg, roll it all in rice paper, deep-fry, chill, then dip again in a decadent tempura batter before refrying and serving in a sweet pond of honey mayo. This calorific largesse has a Sichuan skeleton and a wanton, Lower East Side underbelly. It’s wickedly delicious. Red Farm’s co-founder Ed Shoenfield has spent 40 years in the New York Chinese food scene, and there’s a rich sense of that unabashed broadness in every dish we eat. Pretty, handcrafted pork soup dumplings, served by incessantly upbeat staff, arrive with candy-coloured straws to suck up the piggy broth. A main course of shrimp-stuffed crispy chicken turns out to be a verily peculiar hybrid of “Lucky House”-type prawn toast and Colonel Sanders’ fried chicken. The skin of the chicken is peeled back, smeared with a pink, mashed-prawn, garlic and ginger gloop, replaced, then deep-fried and the whole franken-bird served with a peanut dipping sauce. Those cheeseburger spring rolls, oozing with melted cheese, come battered, obviously, yet still moist and still delicate: a wild mix of high finesse and 3am stoner experimentation. If all this sounds ghastly, don’t fret for Red Farm’s profits, because on a wet Wednesday night in autumn, the place was heaving by 8pm. Those Pac-Man dim sum, which will offend and delight in equal parts, are being served to every table at £12 a plate. If the food at Red Farm was atrocious, underseasoned, loveless slop, which is widely available throughout Covent Garden, the wheels would very quickly fall off this rather costly dining experience. Instead, it’s all just rather adorable. Crunchy vegetable peanut dumplings are delicately wrapped but stonkingly nutty. A side of Chinese broccoli with fresh shiitake was perhaps less than thrilling, but, oddly, everyone at the table remarked on the wonderful, humble, soft, crunchy vegetable fried rice. Pudding, which you absolutely do not need, but it’s there on the bottom of the menu anyway, like an open act of hostility against your waistline, is custard bao. OK, there are two things on the list; the other is “fruit plate”, which is pudding only in the eyes of Gwyneth Paltrow. The custard bao is soft, pillowy, almost salty, pleasingly bland and mainly something to play with while you stare at the bill for three people who drank only two Manhattans and a few glasses of Rivarose Prestige brut, yet seem to have spent more than you’d blow on an Asda Friday night big shop, including a couple of George items you didn’t need and a Chinese takeaway on the way home. But Red Farm is a place to remember if you simply want to please people; it’s for charming clients, or an I’ve-had-a-bad-day, credit card be damned-type of place.

I’m sure Francis Bacon, who drank copiously at The French House in Soho, would have curled a lip at a lowly critic prancing in to assess a space that he and Dylan Thomas had already deemed near-perfect. Furthermore, it is rare that I begin a review of a brand new venture by grounding it in the dusty, what-went-before, but in The French’s case, the past is not a foreign country. Yes, Neil Borthwick, formerly head chef of Merchant’s Tavern, may have taken the reins upstairs in this Grade II-listed building, but his approach is to preserve and conserve this patch of Dean Street’s wonky honour. There is a school of thought that claims “Soho is dead”; killed off by developers, petty residents and the damned council. The bohemians have scattered, they say, and the knocking shops have slowed their knockings. It’s worth mentioning that other locals say this is rot, and that the place still lends itself to being a moral abyss. Whatever your view, it is inarguable that Dean Street has been gobbled up by Crossrail, Tesco Metro and bleak co-working spaces where the macchiato-fuelled shout into Skype about start-ups. This is why Borthwick’s all-new, not-new French House is so welcome. Because here is a place to talk all afternoon about nothing. Famously, The French has frowned, over recent decades, on mobile phone and laptop usage. And although I couldn’t imagine the ever-genial Scotsman Borthwick haranguing an Instagram influencer for pouting beside his baked leeks and sauce gribiche, there’s definitely a sense that The French House lends itself to a more off-the-record, olde-style, discreet debauchery. A newcomer to The French House might wonder if there’s any lunch going there at all. This is a likeably shabby “French-themed” boozer. Inside, a chalkboard beside the narrow, well-plodded stairwell declares the “upstairs bar open”. There’s no music, so you arrive to the glorious clatter of your own feet. The dining room consists of 12 or so small, practical, old-fashioned tables. One member of staff alone serves the drinks, the dishes and runs the floor. By central London standards, this feels like stepping out of a time machine. Borthwick presents a short, pleasing, changeable menu. Some Carlingford oysters. Perhaps rabbit rillettes or pork terrine with pickles. Maybe soft ox cheek with black pepper, or salt cod brandade with soft-boiled eggs. For afters, expect apple and quince crumble with shortbread, lemon posset with shortbread or peut-être un poached pear. This is classic, earthy cooking. It is a damned good lunch. It is French-ish, although it’s worth remembering that The French was so nicknamed after foreigner Victor Berlement took tenure in 1914. He was actually a Belgian. The clientele were seemingly too clattered on his home-bottled vin rouge to notice. If you’re vegetarian or vegan, there are scant few offerings here, and that approach is possibly the most French thing of all. We began with a crisp glass of Canard-Duchêne. It was Monday at noon. Neither of us was drinking. Who drinks at lunchtime on a Monday any more? And with both of us so, so very busy, too. But it’s difficult to channel self-important sobriety at The French, knowing this is where Brendan Behan, Jeffrey Bernard and Dylan Thomas drank in the face of deadlines. So we had another. Then some Château Vircoulon Bordeaux. We shared a piece of sourdough toast slathered in goat’s curd. This arrived with a confit bulb of garlic with soft, translucent pearls to tease out with a knife and smear. We ate that with a thoughtfully constructed salad of roast squash, fresh watercress, pickled walnuts and roast Jerusalem artichokes. A bowl of lamb broth, more of a light stew than a bolshie soup, appeared with piece of pungent, rich Welsh rarebit. We ate brill in anchovy butter with a side of dressed green leaves and a plentiful pot of ridiculous, hips-be-damned pommes aligot. The room filled up with tourists, food-scene folk, theatrical people. A large serving of freshly folded chocolate and hazelnut mousse lying in a puddle of cream was delivered, then some comté with a scattering of biscuits. As we left, the rest of the room appeared to be settling in for some day drinking. The French has lasted a century by being fully supportive of such wanton behaviour. It is safe in Borthwick’s hands. Soho isn’t over. There are still many, many of us completely out to lunch. • The French House 49 Dean Street, London W1, 020-7437 2477. Open Mon-Fri, lunch only (for now), noon-3pm.

Starters £7-£11. Mains £7-£36 (the latter for a whole lobster). Desserts £5. Wines from £17 There is, in my head, an alternative geography of Britain. It’s not built around the triumphalism of grand museums or cathedrals, but something much more encouraging: the places that have fed me well. If I imagine myself in York, I’m at a table in Skosh, spooning away at an egg filled with whipped egg whites and cream and toasted cheddar and a mushroom duxelles. In Manchester, I want to be at Albert’s Schloss, with the slow-roasted pork knuckle and the drag queens, probably in that order. In Gateshead, I want to be at Träkol, sucking the black-bean sauce off the sweetest of clams. The mental map is marked out in trails of knives and forks leading to plates piled with good taste. In Edinburgh, it’s Ondine. There are other places in the city I pine for. I love the Honours and Gardener’s Cottage. But Ondine always wins. I do find the shiny surfaces and the box-shouldered 80s glitz baffling, but then I’m not there for the interiors. I’m there for the pitch-perfect seafood: for the tempura squid with its sprightly Vietnamese dipping sauce; for the heaving hot shellfish platter; for the scallops with garlic butter and bacon jam. Lick the shells clean, wipe your mouth and don’t even think about the bill. The good stuff costs. For me to not go there during an Edinburgh visit takes something special. The prospect of the Fishmarket, part of a pier-side development at Newhaven, a few minutes’ drive from Edinburgh’s centre, is that something. It opened last spring, a collaboration between Ondine chef Roy Brett and his long-time suppliers Welch Fishmongers. Instead of Ondine’s view down the Royal Mile, there’s the glitter and ripple of the harbour waters at night. Instead of the heel click of the grand restaurant, there’s a classic metal takeaway counter and, beyond that, a simple dining room. There are walls tiled in jade green and white, and bare-wood tables. The takeaway side looks like a standard chippy. You can have your fish battered, breaded or grilled, but that’s hardly revolutionary. Haddock and chips comes in three sizes, from standard at £7.50 to “whale” at £11.50 (a startling choice of synonym for “extra-large”. They’re serving what? Is that even legal? Oh, I see…) There’s cod, fishcakes and lemon sole. The nearest thing to fancy is battered monkfish with Vietnamese dipping sauce. There is curry sauce and mushy peas. We head for the dining room, where the menu is more expansive. It’s not quite Ondine in trainers. The pricing this side of the divide is too punchy for that, but then the good stuff still costs. At Ondine, for example, the tempura squid is £14. Here it’s £10. We have the crab claws, a pile of eight, for £11, the shells stripped away, leaving the tips as handles, the meat breaded and deep-fried. There is a bowl of mayo on the side. It’s a satisfying plateful; an engrossing process of mayo-dredge and teeth-drag and the sweetest of white meat. Three big langoustine – thumping great beasts of a sort that too often get sent away to Spain or France because they have eyes and claws and British people don’t hold with that sort of thing – come grilled in garlic butter. The meat pulls from the shell. There are implements to get at what’s hiding in the claws. It’s a lengthy business, as it should be for £16. A smoked haddock chowder, herb-flecked and spoon-coatingly thick, is notable for the bite in the cubes of potato. This is butch farmhouse cooking, pursued with acute attention to detail. Alongside fishcakes and mussels comes the fish of the day: a thick wedge of snowfield-white halibut, on nutty purple potatoes with broccoli and a fair dribble of pesto. The plate clears quickly. All of this bears the fat thumbprints of Ondine. It is seafood cookery of the first order, executed by a kitchen which understands that timing is everything. There’s no point in stopping langoustine from being exported or banging a nice shiny halibut on the head if you’re only going to screw them up. They don’t. Which leaves the fish and chips. This is where it all gets a bit weird. Because the Fishmarket is the love child of Ondine I want to dribble and rave and cheer. But I can’t. The fish is fine, but here fine isn’t good enough. You’d try it and go yeah, that’s a piece of fried fish in batter. But you wouldn’t tip your head on one side, dab at an eye and admit undying love, as you might over, say, a plank of the same at the Magpie Café in Whitby, where it arrives looking like a golden galleon in sail. Given the lineage and the price – the smallest, when not taken away, is £12 – you need to be able to feel you can leap to your feet and applaud. If the fish is merely OK, the chips really aren’t. They’re a promise, broken. If you’re going to eat chips, you need to feel that the calories are worth it: that the potatoes have been fretted over, and allowed to swim in the bubbling fat for long enough, at least twice. There should be crunch, and the occasional shatter. These are pale and uninteresting. They’re not quite under-fried enough to warrant being returned. They are just disappointment, fashioned from dry matter. Because surely an under-fried chip is the very definition of a sad night out? Mushy peas are OK, but served in the sort of minuscule portions that give posh fish and chips a bad name. Thank God, then, for the two desserts. There is an extremely squidgy chocolate fudge brownie, which we have with a scoop of mango sorbet. Better still is a lemon posset, with a dollop of lemon curd on top, and on the side, two still-warm madeleines. It’s a lot of dessert for £5. Of course, it doesn’t make up for the chips. Nothing will. But it soothes the heart a little. The white wine list is a dozen long and the red wines number just four, which is as it should be. The Fishmarket has a lot going for it. They appear to have thought carefully about the proposition. And then weirdly misfired on the most important bit. If it’s possible for a restaurant to be both hugely enjoyable and utterly baffling all at once, then this really is the place. News bites During this trip to Scotland I stopped off at the Cheesy Toast Shack, above the beach at St Andrews. This is sandwich as main event: try the Arbroath smoky, with mature cheddar, the New Yorker with pastrami and dill pickle, or the macaroni cheese, a carb-on-carb fest, which will sustain you through many a breaker. They cost between £5 and £7. Find them on Facebook at thecheesytoastshack. Chef Aiden Byrne, of Restaurant MCR in Manchester, is also to open a grill room in Liverpool inspired by those at grand London hotels such as the Savoy. He has taken over what was the Vincent Café and Cocktail Bar which, until recently, was owned by footballer Steven Gerrard. The Metropolitan Bar and Grill Rooms will open later this year. The Flitch of Bacon, in Essex, which recently won a Michelin star, has been forced to close temporarily because of chronic electrical issues, causing the power to cut out in the kitchen. Chef Tim Allen told Caterer magazine the closure was ‘heart-breaking’ (flitchofbacon.co.uk).

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(448,'2021-06-20T11:00:21Z','Chapli kabab, prawn ‘nacos’, ghormeh sabzi – British-Afghan barbecue recipes','Barbecue business Cue Point is only in its fifth year and already it has shifted from pub kitchen to catering events with a trailer and sending out meal kits around the UK – featuring a menu that Observer restaurant critic Jay Rayner “rampaged through”. More recently, it opened London’s first drive-through barbecue at Chiswick’s Pavilion, since joined by a dine-in service. Drawing on co-founder Mursal Saiq’s Afghan and head chef Joshua Moroney’s Guyanese-British heritage, there are briskets, smoked for 14 hours and then sliced and folded into brioche buns, or piled on platters with chicken wings, slaw, fries and sweetcorn. There are fried chicken and veggie buns, and smoked racks of ribs – beef or lamb – with herby Afghan-inspired condiments . The couple met 10 years ago, when they both worked at a street-food market in east London. Saiq’s background was as a manager in small businesses, Moroney was the head chef at barbecue outfit Smokestak when it was a food trailer. They loved the bustle of the street-food scene, but became disillusioned as growing popularity meant growing prices, a cover charge to enter some venues, and increasing barriers to who could enjoy the food. Saiq remembers trying to get her family and friends to come along, then realising how little, as Muslims or vegetarians, they could actually eat. She and Moroney wanted to create something with the same kind of energy, but make the food accessible. Moroney explains that behind the scenes of the restaurants he worked in, the staff were predominantly Muslim, yet he never saw fasting or food restrictions taken into account. “We’re all here together,” he says, “so we all should be able to sit down at the same table, to share meals and have conversations.” Taking pork off the menu to replace it with lamb was a simple yet radical step towards barbecue inclusivity. “At the Pavilion, we serve women in burqas, with the biggest halal bloggers breaking their fast, and west London rugby boys – and that’s what we want,” says Saiq. When it came to the home-delivery kits, they drew on Saiq’s family recipes for the vegan options – the grilled then stewed aubergine dish is a standout (and adapted here). There’s no seafood on the menu, but prawn nacos are something they love to eat and, like all the recipes here, reflect how Saiq and Moroney cook at home – whether with a simple smoking set-up, a grill outside or an oven if the weather is bad. Nacos, Saiq explains, are really just Afghan naan, but a tiny version – their own branding invention. “A naco is a taco and a naan, his South American heritage and my Afghan heritage,” she says. “We’ve taken these two foods and reappropriated them into an item that we recognise and can say: ‘This is what we are; this makes sense for us.’” While kitchens are recognised as melting pots of culture, it’s not always reflected in management. With that in mind, Cue Point are fundraising for their training programme which they hope will help support refugees by improving their English, as well as life skills, and provide them with the tools to enter the hospitality industry and to move up the ladder. With new enterprises, a relatively new site, and summer looming, Cue Point is heading into a busy barbecuing time. When they get a break? They’ll still be barbecuing. “It’s all we do on our days off,” laughs Saiq. Downtime is valuable for recipe innovation. She has cardamom on her mind, and wants to try it in a hot sauce. Moroney has a more low-key approach to relaxation and plans to keep things simple by cooking steaks. His one essential barbecue accompaniment? “Cocktails, always.” Cue Point’s tips for better BBQs 1 Being ready – and safe – is key. Have all the equipment you need with you and laid out, ready to grab – including oven gloves or tea towels, because things get hot. 2 As Moroney says: “If you’re looking, it ain’t cooking.” Don’t open your barbecue or smoker to take a photo, or wander off while it’s open to get a basting brush (see tip above). Don’t keep turning things. Without temperature retention, you’ll ruin the whole process. 3 Speaking of heat, buy a thermometer or two – a meat probe, and maybe an internal thermometer for your smoker. A probe isn’t necessarily going to tell you when your meat is ready, but it helps you be more consistent. Meat isn’t cheap, so give yourself every chance to get it right and not overcook it. 4 Fat is important. Whether grilling steaks or cooking a large piece of meat slowly, a quarter-inch of fat goes a long way in helping to keep things juicy. 5 Experiment with brines to impart flavour and for tenderness. Salt is the most important element (Moroney uses a 5-7% solution for long soaks and 10% for quicker ones), but try out different juices to help tenderise meat, and try to find a good balance for spices, sugar and salt. While Cue Point uses wet brine for lamb and chicken, for beef it simply uses a dry rub of salt, pepper and sugar. To heat the barbecue Although we use a 4-metre smoker, a kettle-style barbecue with a tight-fitting lid will work well for these dishes. Always create a decent set-up for your charcoal (or oak and kindling if you’re using a more sophisticated, smoker-style barbecue.) A “castle” is the best thing for even heat distribution and fire longevity. Place charcoal briquettes in a criss-cross formation to create a small tower; this is the base to your fire and means the charcoal heats up evenly – and will evenly heat any more charcoal you add. When searing any meat on a barbecue grill, high heat is important. Make your castle, light it, and then close the lid of the barbecue (not the whole way as the fire must breathe). After 30-45 minutes you should have roaring charcoal and even some embers, not sad dying coals. To make herb salt Blitz 100g of edible rock salt with the leaves from 10g of rosemary and 10g of thyme. Regular salt can be used if you don’t have herb salt. BBQ-style borani banjan “When we were younger, my siblings and I would fight over the juicy end bit of the aubergine in this dish,” says Mursal Saiq. “It was typically reserved for the head of the household. Don’t waste it – make sure you include the whole aubergine and then suck the juices from the end.” Serves 4-6 aubergines 2 whole herb salt 2 tbsp paprika 1 tbsp za’atar 1 tsp vegetable oil about 3-4 tbsp white onion 1 small , diced garlic 2 cloves, crushed cayenne pepper ¼ tsp ground cumin ½ tsp tomato puree 1 tsp tomatoes 5, chopped ground turmeric ¼ tsp garam masala ½ tsp sumac ¼ tsp For the yoghurt vegan yoghurt 150-200ml (or Greek yoghurt) garlic 1 clove, grated herb salt ½ tsp dried mint a sprinkling Cut the aubergine into rounds 2½cm thick – including the stalk end – season them well with half of the herb salt, half of the paprika and a little za’atar. This is best if you’re able to do it the night before you’re going to cook. To cook on the barbecue Preheat the barbecue according to the instructions above . You will need a high heat for caramelising the aubergine slices. Use a pastry brush to lightly brush the slices with oil. Place them directly on the grill to colour. Keep a close eye on them – 1-2 minutes each side should be enough, you are not trying to cook them, just give them a good caramelisation. After each slice has been turned, pop the lid closed for 15 minutes to infuse with a smoky flavour. To cook on the stove Heat the oil in a large pan over a medium heat, then add the aubergine slices in batches, and fry until they are golden-brown in colour. Do not over-fry them otherwise the slices will get soggy; you want them to be slightly firm in the centre. Pat them with kitchen roll to remove excess oil, then repeat the process with the remaining slices. Meanwhile, prepare your sauce on the hob. In a large pan on high heat, add 2-3 teaspoons of oil, the onions and garlic, stirring frequently. Season with pinches of the herb salt, paprika, cayenne and cumin. Sauté till the onions become light golden-brown – about 3 minutes – then turn down the heat to medium. Add the tomato puree and the tomatoes, and half of the rest of the spices – turmeric, garam masala and sumac, as well as the herb salt, paprika, cayenne and cumin – and cook until the tomatoey mixture become soft and mushy. This will take around 7 minutes. Then, retrieve your smoked or pan-fried aubergine slices and pop them into this mixture with about 100ml of water and the rest of the spices. Cover the dish with a lid and cook on a low simmer for around 10 minutes. Put the yoghurt in a bowl and whisk in the garlic, then a little herb salt to taste. Whisk it all well so the consistency becomes looser than traditional yoghurt. To serve, spread some garlicky yoghurt on a dish, then place your aubergine and rich reduced tomato sauce on top. Finally, pour over more yoghurt and garnish with dried mint, as is traditional. Cue Point’s ghormeh sabzi This is Josh’s barbecue twist to a classic Afghan comfort dish, a combination of aromatic, flavourful spinach paired with low-and-slow-cooked lamb. If you are able to marinate the lamb the night before and leave it in the fridge, you’ll get better results. To maintain the heat, you will need to top up your charcoal at least once during this recipe. To do this, place the new charcoal directly on top of the old charcoal – check your fire occasionally and try to do this before the old charcoal is embering too much, so the new stuff catches well. Serves 4-6 lamb shanks 2 (1kg, total weight, bone in) herb salt ground black pepper 1 tsp cayenne pepper ¼ tsp garlic 5 cloves; 2 crushed, 3 whole lemon juice of ½ new potatoes 400g, chopped into small chunks white onions 2 medium, sliced fresh spinach 2 bunches dried fenugreek leaves 1 tbsp ground turmeric 1 tbsp ground cumin 1 tsp olive oil 1 tbsp For the corn sweet corn 3 cobs, husk stripped, cobs in half butter 1 tbsp za’atar a sprinkling finely chopped coriander to garnish Season your lamb shanks with a tablespoon of herb salt. Do this first to bring moisture out of the meat. Then season with the black pepper, cayenne, crushed garlic cloves and a little lemon juice. To cook on the barbecue Preheat the barbecue. Place the lamb shanks directly on the grill, as close to the heat as possible. Don’t move them too much – at least until you have given them a minute or 2 to brown on each side. The colour should be a dark golden-brown: imagine burnt sugar, not black, not greyish brown. Make sure all sides are seared well. In a large cast-iron barbecue dish, layer up the potatoes, onions and garlic cloves. Cover with half the spinach leaves, season with the fenugreek, turmeric, cumin, a pinch of herb salt and a drizzle of oil, then place your seared lamb shanks on top. Close the lid of your barbecue and let the lamb and vegetables cook for up to 1-1½ hours. (Make sure your fire is going strong as the total cooking time will be up to 3 hours.) Keep an eye on your meat by checking it every 30-45 minutes. Do so quickly, not letting out too much smoke or reducing the temperature. After 1-1½ hours, place the rest of the spinach over the top of the dish, cover it all with tin foil, and place back on the barbecue. Cook for a further 1½-2 hours. When it’s done, the lamb should easily come apart, and the onions, potatoes and spinach should be soft. You can remove the bone at this point and let everyone dig straight into the dish with tongs. About 15 minutes before you’re ready to eat, bring a large pot of water to the boil. Boil your sweet corn for 5-10 minutes, then place the cobs on the grill (or in an oven, if that’s how you’re cooking the shanks) to give it some colour. Dress with butter, and garnish with za’atar and a little coriander. To cook in the oven Preheat the oven to 170C fan/gas mark 5. Place a cast-iron pan on a hob on a fairly high heat, add a drizzle of oil and brown the seasoned shanks on all sides. Make sure they get a decent browning and caramelisation. In a cast-iron dish that comfortably fits in your oven, layer the potatoes, onions and whole garlic cloves. Finally, cover with half the spinach leaves, season with the fenugreek, turmeric, cumin, herb salt and a drizzle of oil, then place your seared lamb shanks on top. Cook in the oven for 1-1½ hours, then place the rest of the spinach over the lamb, cover the dish with tin foil, and place back in the oven and cook for a further 1½ hours at 145C fan/gas mark 3. Serve with the corn (method above). Afghan brunch There is nothing like an aromatic, yolky brunch, and this one contrasts strong and rich flavours with fresh and citrussy ones. This beautiful vegetarian dish is reminiscent of traditional Afghan brunches and, for a moment on Sunday mornings, takes me home. Serves 4-6 olive oil 3 tbsp potatoes 3, diced into 2cm cubes white onion 1 large, diced herb salt about 1 tbsp garlic 2 cloves, crushed fresh plum tomatoes 6-10, chopped eggs 6 fresh parsley a handful, chopped fresh coriander a handful, chopped green chilli 1, chopped thinly lime 1, sliced into 6 wedges For the seasoning paprika 1 tbsp za’atar 1 tbsp herb salt 1 tbsp ground black pepper 1 tsp ground cumin ½ tsp To cook on the barbecue Prepare your barbecue according to the previous instructions. Pour 2 tablespoons of oil into a large cast-iron pan (make sure it has a lid, you will need it). Season your potatoes with half of the seasoning and pop them in the pan. Place the pan on the grill and leave for about 10-12 minutes, until cooked and crisp, moving the potatoes around every few minutes. When the potatoes are cooked, remove them from the pan. Please, remember to use an oven glove when touching the pan! To caramelise your onion, use the same cast-iron pan as your potatoes. Add the last tablespoon of oil, the diced onion and a pinch of the herb salt and cook until golden brown. Then add the garlic, let it caramelise for half a minute, add the other half of the seasoning. Return the potatoes to the pan, then stir in the tomatoes and cook for 2-3 minutes. Make 6 wells for your eggs, break an egg into each well, and stick the lid on for about 8 minutes, depending on how you like your eggs. Add herb salt to taste, then serve garnished with the fresh herbs, chillies and lime. To cook in the oven Preheat to 180C fan/gas mark 6. Put the potatoes in a roasting tray and season with half of your seasoning, then add 2 tablespoons oil and toss to combine. Roast for 10-15 minutes or until cooked and crisp, moving them around every 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large oven-safe pan, heat the last tablespoon of oil and add the onions, a pinch of herb salt and cook until golden brown. Add the garlic and let it all caramelise for a minute, then add the rest of the seasoning. Now, add your crispy potatoes from the oven to the onion mixture, then add the tomatoes and cook for a few minutes, mixing and turning frequently. Make 6 wells for your eggs, and break an egg into each well. Place your dish back in the preheated oven, and bake for about 4 minutes, or until set to your liking . (No need to use a lid on this occasion.) Remove from the oven, add more herb salt to taste, garnish with the fresh herbs, chillies and slices of lime, and serve immediately. Grilled chilli, coriander and lime king prawn ‘nacos’ This dish is a real homage to both Josh’s Guyanese heritage and my Afghan roots. It might look a bit complicated, but we promise you it’s worth it. Serves 4-6 king prawns 12, shell and heads on fresh red chilli 1 herb salt 5 tbsp paprika ¼ tsp cayenne ¼ tsp olive oil 100ml lime juice of 1 Afghan naan or pitta 8 (see recipe below) lettuce of your choice ½, shredded For the Afghan chutney green chillies 2, sliced coriander 1 bunch,roughly chopped garlic 3 cloves, chopped limes juice of 2 caster sugar ½ tbsp herb salt or normal salt ¾ tsp distilled white vinegar 110ml For the pickled red onions red onions 2, diced limes juice of 2 herb salt or salt 1 tsp If cooking on a barbecue, now is the time to get it going. To clean your prawns, place each prawn on a chopping board, with the curvature facing you, stretch the prawn out and with a small, sharp knife, make a very small slit down the centre of the prawn where the waste tract is, then use the knife to gently remove the tract so as to not ruin the structure of the prawn. Slice the chilli quite thinly and combine in a bowl with the prawns. Throw in the herb salt, spices and olive oil, then add the lime juice. Completely oat the prawns with the salty, oily mix. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Now make your Afghan chutney. Mix up the chillies, coriander, garlic and lime juice in a bowl. Add the remaining ingredients and combine in a food processor – you’re looking for a semi-liquid paste-like consistency. Turn into a bowl, mix thoroughly, cover and refrigerate till needed (this can marinate at the same time as the prawns). Put the red onion in a bowl, add the lime juice and salt, mix together and let this percolate in the fridge alongside the prawns and chutney. When you’re almost ready to eat, grill your prawns over hot coals or pan-fry in a cast-iron dish on the hob. Cook them for about 3 minutes on a high heat – about 1½ minutes on each side. You don’t want to over-cook them, but simultaneously you want to achieve grill marks and that beautiful caramelised Maillard reaction. Serve the grilled prawns on the naan, pouring all those gorgeous excess juices over the prawns. Top with lettuce, the chutney and the pickled onions. Afghan naan Makes 10 warm water 350ml dry yeast 7g caster sugar 1 tbsp plain flour 1kg salt 1 tbsp corn oil 60ml egg yolk 1 mixed with 1 tbsp water nigella seeds a sprinkling To make the dough, mix the warm water, yeast and sugar in a jug, and let it sit for 10 minutes. When you see a froth, add ½ tablespoon of flour, then let it sit for 5 more minutes. Put the rest of the flour in a large mixing bowl and sprinkle the salt over it. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the oil, then the egg water mix, then slowly add small amounts of the water, yeast and sugar mixture until you have produced a soft, moist dough that can be handled. Knead well for 5 minutes. Put the dough ball back in the bowl, cover with a towel, and let it rise. After 1½ hours, punch down the risen dough, divide into 8 equal parts and roll each into a ball. Roll each ball into an oval shape 15-17cm long and 1-1.5cm thick. Use a fork to draw 3 lines along the length of each naan for design. Sprinkle each naan with the nigella seeds. To cook on the barbecue Preheat the barbecue. When cooking the naans, we want some actual fire – not smoking or grilling – so add more charcoal or logs. You will be using the grill, so make sure the rack is clean, as your naans will go straight onto it. Place each naan on the grill, and cook over the fire and charcoal on each side for a few minutes; as they get darker, turn them so they cook evenly. Each naan should take 5-7 minutes in total. The naan can also be grilled in a suitable frying or cast-iron pan over a hot barbecue grill, in 1 teaspoon of oil. To cook in the oven Preheat the oven to 190-200C fan/gas mark 7-8. Place the naan on a baking tray, or put them straight on the oven rack, and bake for 8-10 minutes or until golden brown. Chapli kabab Chapli kababs (or “slipper” burgers) are the street food of Kabul, where you’ll find merchants with mobile fryers walking around the streets preparing burgers to go. We’ve adjusted the recipe to include fattier elements. Serves 4-6 pitta 2, crushed (you can use naan) beef mince 500g gram flour 3 tbsp ground turmeric 1 tbsp ground allspice 1 tbsp paprika 1 tsp herb salt 1 tbsp cayenne 1 tsp tomatoes 2, finely chopped white onions 2, finely chopped jalapeños 3, finely chopped garlic 3 cloves, crushed coriander leaves ¼ bunch, finely chopped egg yolk 1 unsalted butter or ghee 2 tbsp, melted olive oil 120ml (you may not need all 120ml for the barbecue method) To serve Afghan naan or pitta 8 (see recipe above) tomatoes 2 large, thinly sliced red onion 1, thinly sliced sauces Afghan chutney (see recipe above), hummus, sour cream Preheat the oven to 180C fan/gas mark 6. Toast the pitta on a tray in the oven – don’t burn it but make sure it is crisp to the touch. Place your bread in a food processor or blender and make sure it is well processed. In a large bowl mix together the mince, gram flour, turmeric, allspice, paprika, herb salt and cayenne. Then add the tomatoes, onion, jalapeños, garlic and coriander, and mix in. Add your breadcrumbs to the mince mixture, then the egg yolk and butter. Mix it all together very well. To form the mince into large, flat patties, take about 1¼ tbsp of the mixture in your hand, and create a small ball, then flatten this ball with the palm of your hand. To cook on the barbecue Preheat the barbecue according to the previous instructions. Brush some oil on each side of the patty and place them on the grill. You want to achieve a golden-brown colour on both sides. A burger scraper helps, as these can get sticky. Once there is decent heat and caramelisation occurring, cover with the barbecue lid for 20-30 minutes. These patties are thin, so it’s easy to decide if they are cooked by the colour of the meat – you can serve them medium or medium-well if you want. To cook on the stove Put a large frying pan on a high-medium heat and heat the oil. Lightly fry each side of the chapli kabab each until golden-brown.

Yes, I know it’s just dinner. But dinner is my job, and some evenings remind me I could be running a cat orphanage in Udaipur, or something useful. Rather than, say, visiting a restaurant that serves tiny tastes of “bitter herbs, parmesan, anchovy”. Plus, exactly 15 other teensy dishes such as “halibut with elderflower” or “squid with sandalwood”. Each concoction offputting, but hewn to test boundaries. Each reminiscent of something an antihero in a Bret Easton Ellis novel would order. Gazelle in Mayfair is a very, very cool new restaurant and bar over two floors, where the vibe is experimental and gastronomically challenging. And also luxurious. The room is accessed by a private lift. The banquettes are red and gold velvets. It is a collision between Tony Conigliaro, one of London’s most venerated bar owners, and a Ferran Adrià-linked chef called, rather majestically, Rob Roy Cameron. Conigliaro and Cameron’s last endeavour was the pioneering, ever-puzzling, beyond-parody cocktail bar in Hackney called – or not called – Untitled. It’s a bar where a cocktail such as the “Violin” contains dark oak, pine, beeswax and the tree bark resin benzoin. Yes, this does sound like a glass of Mr Sheen Multi-Surface Dust and Shine. Do not say this in Untitled. Do not make jokes at all. Your drab, pedestrian tastebuds and gag reflex mean nothing here. You are in the presence of great vision. Gazelle sits on Albemarle Street close to Green Park in the midst of a growing Bermuda Triangle of scene-setting restaurants such as Hide, Indian Accent and Novikov, where punters flock in trancelike states and expense accounts are lost in a vortex. The lighthouse in these perilous waters is Gymkhana, the high-end Raj-era-themed Indian restaurant, serving blissful biryanis, chat, methi keema, paneer tikka kebabs and Chettinad duck dosa. If you’re offered dinner in this area on someone else’s tab, I implore you to become forceful about a reservation there, even potentially repeating the word “Gymkhana” time and again like a malfunctioning robot until the point is made. For god’s sake, don’t make all these bizarre dinners I’ve eaten be in vain. We arrive at Gazelle and the lift is broken. I order a Twinkle – one of my favourite cocktails. Icy champagne, vodka and elderflower. Invented by Conigliaro himself, back in a more orthodox era before chalk, ylang ylang and white clay became his schtick. Hungry, I order six dishes. First the mushroom, pine nut and white garlic. It’s a delicious bowl of enoki strands, pruned to look like spaghetti in a rich, wild garlic sauce. I say “bowl”: the portion would struggle to cover the floor of a Barbie paddling pool. All dishes are made to share, the waiter had told us without even slightly corpsing. Next along is leek hearts in chicken vinaigrette: six thin, lightly cooked leek innards in a clear puddle. I eat my three very small pieces of leek and order a glass of Maximin Riesling, to drown out the rumblings of inner dissent. Next along is “turbot with sea herbs”. It is roughly a fishfinger’s worth of doubtlessly premium-grade turbot, served with a pretty green hat. At this point I notice a liferaft of “fennel and spelt bread” lurking at the bottom of the menu, as if it’s ashamed of its carby stomach-filling abilities. It arrives. My guest and I divvy it up and eat it rapidly. “Would you like more bread?” the waiter asks. “No,” I say, because lining our stomachs in this covert manner feels faintly ridiculous. Two more dishes appear: a bowl featuring two small pieces of monkfish in a pretty emerald pistachio gloop, plus two pieces of Iberico pork “presa” with a small puddle of pureed carrot. “Bugger this – I am going to Gymkhana,” I say. This has been on the cards for six months. Right through my trip to Indian Accent and for the duration of my dinner at Rüya in Grosvenor House. “We’re going to another restaurant?” my guest says. “Yes, I’m getting the bill. I’ve had seven dishes and I’ve not eaten.” I pay the £150 bill as we make polite noises at the “chocolate, passionfruit summer savoury”, which is indeed savoury. I pitch up at the bar in Gymkhana and order the potato chat, chana masala with tamarind, a plate of dosa mysore sabsi and a glass of Rolly Gassman Sylvaner. A Gazelle is a swift animal that pronks from place to place avoiding predators, ever in search of sustenance. I am similarly expedient and resourceful. So far, it’s served me very well.

Five-course set menu £38; daily plate £9; wines from £24 When I first heard about Angelina, I suffered acute flashbacks. All of a sudden it was November 2003, and I was back in a sun-drenched white box of a room in London’s St James’s, feeling unkempt and nowhere near cool enough for the walls. A waiter was offering to explain the concept behind the menu. I was trying not to flinch. London’s nasty, brutish critics pointed and laughed at the place and I pointed and laughed with them. After it closed, one of the owners, Jamie Barber, gave a spirited defence: “Some people say Shumi wasn’t a successful restaurant, but I disagree. I say it was an unmitigated disaster. I think we got everything right except for the design, the service, the menu, the pricing and the execution. It was an extremely difficult period.” Shumi’s revolutionary idea was to fuse the food of Italy and Japan. There was a “paccio bar” where you got to eat “Italian sushi”. The risotto came with chopsticks. And so on. Barber, who has gone on to greater things, has already said what needs to be said, so I won’t add to it. Still, I did shiver involuntarily when I heard that a bunch of chefs with experience at good places like Bocca di Lupo, Bevis Marks and Enoteca Turi were coming together in London’s Dalston to undertake “a surreal exploration of Japanese and Italian cuisines, cultures and influences”. To which Karl Marx’s line about history repeating itself, first as tragedy then as farce, came to mind. Had we not suffered enough? We can all relax, because Angelina is very much a disaster avoided – and by a long mark. Shumi’s undoing was its jaw-jutting swagger. God, but it loved itself. (I suppose somebody had to.) Angelina feels like a beautifully intentioned, low-key experiment. It’s like being invited round for dinner by your mate; the nerdy one who can really cook, and who has just gone into his Japanese phase. The most overtly Japanese elements are in the decor: the paper lanterns shading lightbulbs, for example, or the noren curtain over the doorway to the back kitchen from the open kitchen out front. The food, meanwhile, is a gentle treatise on what Japanese and Italian cooking have in common. For surely tempura and fritto misto are two preparations with the same intent? They both want to preserve the integrity of the main ingredient courtesy of a crisp batter overcoat. Aren’t sashimi and crudo close relatives that really ought to get to know each other better? What’s key here is that the kitchen is not attempting to pretend they have completely nailed the intricacies of Japanese food. At base they are serving Italian food, with intriguing Japanese grace notes. This time round I give thanks that there appears to be space in the market for something so curious and thoughtful. It’s also good value, as long as you are prepared for the works. They serve a five-stage set menu for £38, plus a single daily changing plate at £9. It starts with a fritto misto. There is a plate piled with cime di rape or winter greens, in a crisp, lacy batter overcoat which snaps easily. With them is a sweet soy-based sauce for dipping. On another plate there are artichokes deep-fried in what the Romans refer to as the “Jewish style”, the outer leaves crisped and fragile, alongside thick discs of long-braised pig that has been breaded and deep fried. These come with a dark Japanese-style, sweet-and-sour sauce so that you are now thinking about tonkatsu, that encouraging slab of deep-fried breaded pork loin which is one of the minor miracles of Japanese cooking. Served alongside this, so that the table fills with dainty pieces of Japanese porcelain, is the raw course. There are candy-pink Sicilian prawns dressed only in a little olive oil and lemon, lined up on the plate like commas. They are sweet and lightly sticky. Another plate brings thin slices of marinated sea bream, the translucence of mother of pearl. A third has a heap of tuna tartare. Call these dishes crudo and they’re Italian. Call them sashimi and they’re Japanese. Your call. Next, a risotto studded with dense, oily pieces of unagi – barbecued eel – the rice flavoured with soy butter. If I was being really picky, I would niggle over the risotto’s wobble; over whether it had been cooked out quite long enough. Then again, the pleasure of this dish trumps the technical stuff every time. It reminded me of the end stage of a bowl of unagi chirashi, in which the eel is laid over a heaped bowl of warm sushi rice. The oils from the fish mingle with the grains, and dribbles of soy lubricate the whole intense, comforting business. It may not quite be a bowl of risotto, but it is a plate of loveliness. For the meat course it is the jaw workout that is onglet, given a serious char over the hibachi, but still very much a deep offal pink inside and thoroughly beefy. Alongside is a piece of griddled radicchio, to bring an edge of the bitter to the night. We also get the daily plate which today is hunks of their own coarse-cut sausages, with a rugged back note of the duodenal and the farmyard. It does it for me, but may not do it for others. The pieces of sausage are threaded through sweet heaps of yellow and red cherry tomatoes. It is a fair old plateful for £9. We finish with a bit of a shrug: a panna cotta, with a chocolate mousse and black sesame. All parts are lick-the-bowl-clean good. But there’s no point pretending: both Japan and Italy have compelling dessert traditions. This is from the softer end of both, literally and figuratively. No matter. It’s still a fun ride. As if to emphasise that this is an Italian restaurant looking east, rather than a Japanese place looking west, the wine list is entirely Italian. There is also a bar which, slightly oddly, is off the bogs, though it may be the other way around. It’s such a sweet venture, so cheerfully fanboyish in its devotion to the subtleties of both cooking traditions, that I worry it will gain only niche novelty status. I’d love them to succeed and expand their explorations. To do that the menu will have to change regularly. I’ll assume it will. Oh, and you lot will have to book to eat there. You really should. News bites Gaijin Sushi in Birmingham is another place born out of a non-Japanese cook’s fascination with the food of Japan. In this case, however, it’s all in. Polish-born chef Michal Kubiak has spent years learning his craft, both in Poland and here, and we are the beneficiaries. He brings grace, wit and serious enthusiasm to a mostly classic sushi and sashimi menu, and all at a very fair price (gaijinsushi.co.uk). D&amp;D Restaurants is to close the once iconic Kensington Place restaurant, after 30 years. Under Rowley Leigh for its first 20 years, Kensington Place in west London was regarded as a beacon of modern British cookery. If you’ve ever eaten scallops with pea purée, then you have Leigh and KP to thank. The entire site will be redeveloped. Edinburgh chef Mark Greenaway, who recently closed his eponymous restaurant in the city, has announced his next move. In the middle of April, he is taking over the space in the Waldorf Astoria hotel currently occupied by the Galvin Brothers, to open Grazing by Mark Greenaway (markgreenaway.com).

Sharing plates £6-£26. Desserts £7-£9. Wines from £28 If the past is a foreign country, its embassy is currently located at the corner of Maddox and Mill Streets in London’s Mayfair. This, I think, is intentional. Pucci is presenting itself as the direct descendant of a place on the King’s Road in Chelsea called Pucci Pizza, which was once the haunt of famous people with terrifying haircuts. Rod Stewart, Brian Ferry and Diana Ross went there, as did George Best if he could ever drag himself away from the pub. Or as one review put it in the 90s, eating there meant there was always a danger “that you will share the basement with minor celebs from other decades who will be trying rather sadly to attract attention to themselves”. You get the idea. Owner Pucci Albanese closed the original restaurant in 2010, and now here it is again in Mayfair under the direction of his son Rufus. He’s a pleasingly broad-shouldered man who will make sure you have a good time, or bloody well die trying. “Everybody happy?” he demands of a party of eight next to us, as their food arrives. “Ecstatic, darling,” one replies, on cue. He comes direct from a time when restaurant managers were referred to unironically as “mein host”. I’ve missed mein host. Happily, he’s back. The walls are of bare red brick and hung with 70s pop art paintings of Audrey Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe. The button-back banquettes are in olive green velour. It’s like sitting on a sofa in a front room in Penge, circa 1973. The ceiling has gnarled, thin wooden beams. It’s a wealthy person’s version of a humble farmhouse. The calamari is served in rings, like they always were in that taverna on Mykonos run by that nice English couple called Beryl and Graham who decided to escape the rat race. The music thumps, but it’s good music so we don’t care: Dean Martin bellowing Volare; a winsome Chet Baker sighing out Body and Soul. We even get Louis Armstrong’s Wonderful World, because it’s required under a retro restaurant by-law. When the menu arrives at our table, so does Rufus. He wants to know if we understand the “concept”. I shudder. I can’t help it. I’m a very low-concept kind of chap. Happily, so is this place. They have a list of ultra-thin, Roman-style pizzas of the sort they used to do on the King’s Road. Apparently, they’ve been famous since 1977, though this is the first I’ve heard of them. There are also some small sharing plates cooked up by Rufus’s other half, Tilly Turbett. You can have a pizza and then some small plates or the other way round. That’s the concept. I grasp it fully. The website describes Turbett as an ex-Noma and Gordon Ramsay chef, which is obviously impressive. Tilly’s LinkedIn profile says she did an unpaid stint for a few weeks at Noma in Copenhagen, and was a chef de partie at Maze, which is indeed owned by Gordon Ramsay. You have to sweat your assets. So far, I’ve managed to make Pucci Mayfair sound faintly ludicrous, which it is. But it’s ludicrous in an extremely appealing way. It’s the kind of room in which you can have a very good time, though ideally with someone else’s money. You really might need to be a Chelsea refusenik to swallow some of the pricing: £18 for a pizza is enthusiastic; £45 for one under drifts of shaved black truffle looks like a menu item designed for a man who is going to have to overcompensate big time to impress his date (simpler pizzas are just £8). Happily, the essentials of those pizzas are very good indeed. The crisp base is what I dream of being: remarkably thin. The crust is bubbled and singed. We have one with generous amounts of nose-tickling nduja and snowy burrata and a dribble of honey to soften the chilli hit. It’s a fine piece of work. Other things are as well. Beef brisket is long-braised then pulled into tangles and slicked with lip-sticking jus. It is heaped up on a silky mound of hummus with additional chickpeas that have been roasted. It’s good value at £12. A sizable duck breast is crisp-skinned and pink, dribbled with a pomegranate molasses sauce and dropped languorously on a heap of finely mashed sweet potatoes. A salad of baby gem and Treviso with parmesan and anchovy is bitter and salty in all the right places. Not everything is right. The calamari rings really are baffling. I claimed a couple of months ago that salt and pepper squid was now so ubiquitous it had acquired the rank of British classic, and with good reason. Flat pieces of squid, carefully scored, so that they curl in on each other alongside tentacles, are cheery tender items, and a quiet reminder that the big thick rings of our youth died out for a reason. They are just so many elastic bands. The only reason I can imagine for doing them that way now is because you have an elastic band fetish, you accidentally bought a job lot of geriatric squid or are trying to plug into a nostalgia market. Given the banquettes, the art and Rufus, let’s go with the latter. The other duff note is advertised as courgette fritti. These are turning up on menus all over these days and demand courgettes, sliced into the thinnest of matchsticks, battered and deep fried so that they stop tasting of courgette. It is the perfect way to hide a vegetable’s true nature. Not here. Pucci do them in big beermat-sized slabs. Flick one of these across a room and you could take off a toupee at 20 paces. Order and calm are restored by £9 worth of a truly magnificent Rubensesque pavlova designed for sharing, piled with slices of cardamom-poached pear and lemon verbena. The meringue is crisp and chewy as it should be, the cream a soothing, cooling presence. It’s what come-hither desserts should look like, and a reminder that classic dishes are always such for a good reason. We drink something chilled, white and Italian, fight with the determined waiters to be able to fill our own glasses, sing along to some 1950s bangers and accidentally run up the kind of ton-and-a-half bill that will drive certain people completely nuts. But what can I say? We had a very good time, visiting the past. We revelled in Pucci’s unconscious act of nostalgia. I liked it a lot back there. News bites Pucci’s £45 black truffle pizza manages to make the offering at Jean-Georges at the Connaught, the London outpost of Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s empire, look good value, an achievement of sorts. When I reviewed their black truffle pizza in 2017, it was £29. It was absurd, but I admitted that, were I drunk, I could imagine eating it again, by accident. Currently it’s £35. Inflation, eh? (the-connaught.co.uk) The management of the Carluccio’s chain has offered to pay the settled-status application fees for its 1,550 employees from the EU. Chief executive Mark Jones said the group would not exist were it not for the journey from Italy that Antonio Carluccio originally made. ‘We are passionate about the value they bring to our business and it is something that we are keen to protect. It’s what Antonio would have wanted,’ he said. Both Cantor’s Food Store in Chorlton, Manchester and Restaurant 92 in Harrogate, which were reviewed on these pages immediately before Christmas, have closed.

Small plates £6-£12.50; larger dishes £11-£54.50; wines from £19 Olle Korean barbecue on London’s Shaftesbury Avenue has a shop window which puts the gorgeous displays of diamanté alligators and glass slippers over at Fortnum &amp; Mason on Piccadilly to shame. I’ve walked past Olle’s brightly lit picture windows countless times over the past year, and the view has always been intoxicating: diners at broad communal tables, hunched over electric grill plates, tending to sizzling pieces of meat, fish and vegetables as if they were holy relics. It’s dinner with a floor show. I knew it was only a matter of time before I would become one of those diners. And now, here I am, blinking furiously, because I’ve worked out how this enticing shop window display thing works. Bloody hell, it’s bright in here. I feel like I could get a tan just sitting at the table. Not only do the diners look like they are on display from the outside. It feels as if you’re on display when you become one of them on the inside. And so, to my first tip: there’s a downstairs dining room, which I only discovered when I went to the loo. It’s still bright down there, but it’s not encased in glass. You get used to it in the end, thankfully, because this restaurant is worth the effort. “Olle” is apparently the word for a path, in the dialect of an island off the coast of South Korea, though there doesn’t seem to be anything particularly regional or niche about the offering here. If you’ve been to a Korean restaurant before, the menu will be broadly familiar. They just do it very well and, most importantly, with an uncommon grace and charm. A decade ago, during an extended stay in Los Angeles, I found my way to Soot Bull Jeep, one of the last barbecue places in Korea Town still to use red-hot guttering coals rather than an electric hot plate. It was dark in there – and smoky – and buckets were strategically placed to deal with plumbing leaks. It gave the whole thing a pleasingly raffish, Blade Runner vibe. Most memorably, the dining room was overseen by furrow-browed Korean women who seemed furious with me for coming at all. They huffed every time they tended my grill. I’m sure the fact I kept returning for dinner didn’t help. The staff at Olle seem genuinely pleased to see us. They want to help, which is good because, as I’ve observed before, there can be an awful lot of admin with Korean food. It’s literally high maintenance. The one bit of help they don’t give is a warning that we should order what we want when we want it, rather than at the start. Because if you order it, they will bring it. All at once. We have the corner of an eight-seater communal table and it quickly fills with bowls and dishes of sauce, with salads and servings of rice. I find myself apologising for the lack of space when actually it’s their fault. Alongside the ingredients for barbecuing, which we’ll come to, there are many standards. Their Korean fried chicken is everything I want it to be, with a double fried crunch that creates ricocheting echoes in every cranial hollow and cavity, followed by the confectionery-shop slap of the sweet-savoury sauce. Korean fried chicken is the food world’s undercover agent. Because it represents a culture about which many of us feel we know relatively little, it gets a free pass on to our plates for being gently exotic. Health concerns do not figure. In truth, nutritionally, this KFC is on a par with something you’d pick up at 2am from a south London branch of Morley’s chicken shop when you’re off your head on Diamond White. I mean all this in a very, very good way. A seafood pajeon, a cross between a pancake and an omelette, is full of the crunch of still pert spring onions, the softness of mollusc and crustacean, and lots of crispy frilly bits. From the thoroughly virtuous side of the ledger comes a stew of seafood and ivory white cubes of tofu in a soybean paste broth. It’s a steamy and encouraging bowlful that feels as if it is determined to mother you, one spoonful at a time. At £11.90, including rice, it’s a substantial meal for one. And then there is the grilling, on a round metal electric hot plate, sunk into the corner of the table. All the usual suspects are here: the bulgogi, or thinly sliced curls of rib eye, to be unfurled once on the heat; galbi, or slivers of short rib, served bone in; the thick slabs of fatty pork belly, and the well-marbled chunks of rib eye. They also have a list of wagyu cuts, at punishing prices: 100gm of Grade 5 rib eye costs £27.25. (Weirdly, this is very good value; at Restaurant 34 it’s £45 for the same weight, and at Cut it’s £70). Instead, go for one of the selections. Ours costs £54.50, includes various meats plus prawns the length of my hand, a pokey salad of shredded spring onions, slabs of onion and king oyster mushroom, plus soya bean paste and sesame oil dips. There is easily enough for three. Now the fun begins. We sizzle and we sear. Occasionally a waiter leans over to cut up pieces of meat that are otherwise too big for the metal chopsticks with which we have been supplied. The pork is for those with a taste for caramelised fat. I have that taste. We gnaw on beef rib bones, band-sawed when it was frozen. It is the slabs of rib-eye, charred outside and pink within, that are the stars. We are our own floor show. For those passing by outside we are also now the window display. A little smoke gets in our eyes and we like it like that. We drink a serviceable sauvignon, and hunker down. We don’t even ask about dessert, because this isn’t the place. Instead we cross the road to somewhere I had also walked past repeatedly. I thought it was a bog-standard café knocking out boulders of dense and dispiriting cake. It turns out to be a franchised branch of Pompi, the tiramisu specialists from Rome. I have the classic tiramisu for £5.80. It is light and fluffy and creamy and spongy and utterly compelling. There is a heartening coffee kick and shortly after, an empty plate scraped to the glaze. Both Pompi and Olle are proof, if it were needed, that sometimes you really shouldn’t just walk on by. News bites Seoul Kimchi, a tiny restaurant by Manchester’s Royal Infirmary, was originally a place where Korean students could buy the foods of home, but eventually started cooking and serving it as well. It is basic but good: there are hearty seafood stews, fully stacked bibimbaps and, of course, lots of kimchi. Get booze from the nearby Tesco Express. Search for their page on Facebook. The Cook Book Club, originally founded by food writer Thane Prince at the Drapers Arms pub in Islington, as a forum in which to meet cookery writers and share recipes, relaunches on 13 February. The guest speaker is Niki Segnit, author of The Flavour Thesaurus and Lateral Cooking. Entry is £10, including a glass of wine. Follow @DrapersCookClub on Twitter for event details and more information. It’s all change at the Swan Inn, Esher, which has been run for the past three years by chef Claude Bosi and his brother Cedric. It has been taken over by chef José Pizarro and will re-open in early March with an all-Spanish menu.

Full disclosure: my father is a Scouser. Some of my earliest food memories are of funeral teas in Toxteth, Lion bars from a push-along mobile shop with no engine and, in later years, a whirl around Huyton’s glamorous, two-storey Asda. Truffled celeriac, crayfish emulsions and tonka beans were not regular features in Merseyside dining back then, although the collective psyche has, to me at least, always felt aspirational. As a child, I was more inspired by Margi Clarke than by Madonna, and Liverpool’s food scene – from The Art School to Mowgli and throughout the Baltic Triangle – has flourished on its own terms, not London’s. And now this all-day “neo-bistro” on the Smithdown Road is doing pork collar yakitori and scallops with mango and masala, and it all feels wholly natural. There are raw juices, shakshuka and matcha lattes in the morning, croque-madames and Corpse Bride cocktails at lunchtime, and a dinner menu of seasonal, often local produce that’s just brimming with Scouse swagger and European as well as Japanese splashes. Plentiful shareable plates of butter beans in beef dashi sit alongside barbecued savoy cabbage with chilli, ginger and soy, and mushrooms with ponzu custard. Belzan pulls off a rare thing that many restaurants try and fail to do: being relaxed as hell, but also a little challenging, too. Calves’ liver fried in Pedro Ximénez sherry isn’t for everyone, and while Claudja Barry’s Love For the Sake of Love playing dreamily is my idea of heaven, maybe you’d prefer silence. Likewise, the unisex loo, which, with irony, is indeed for everyone but won’t be everyone’s cup of tea. The place also welcomes well-behaved dogs, of which I am 100% supportive. In fact, I’d prefer if the clientele in most restaurants was mainly affable collies, rottweilers and terriers. I love anywhere that serves dogs, because it roots out the non-dog people, who can starve for all I care. One Belzan reviewer on PrickAdvisor reports a horrific experience where the “reviewer” (lol) met a doggy guest and had to flounce out over hygiene concerns. “Oh, go and eat chips in the car then, Brenda,” I thought, and made a reservation. Sadly, only one dog turned up on our visit, and then only briefly, during my second bourbon peach ice tea: a plump labrador that was a contender for the World’s Goodest Girl championship. “This place feels like Berlin,” my guest said at least four times over dinner, as if they’d ever put food in their mouth during a weekend in Berlin. I can’t say that everything I ate at Belzan was perfect, or daintily plated or life-changing, but I certainly left fed and happy. In a busy room with bright service, we picked at slightly flabby gnocchi with wild mushrooms strewn with pumpkin seed. A whole Cornish squid, in all its cephalopodic majesty, arrived barbecued on a plate dotted with nursery-painting smears of gordal olive, lemon and thyme. Buttermilk-drenched rabbit came in a confident, crisp breadcrumb and piled prettily with fresh apple and pickled fennel. I adored those shamelessly al dente butter beans with parsley and a few charred savoy leaves. There’s a lot here for vegetarians and, if you ask nicely, and with a few tweaks, for vegans, too. The truffled celeriac turned out to be a pile of thick, rather clumsy, but satisfying chips embossed with melted Tunworth (aka British camembert), while roast broccoli with garlic and lemon continues to win my heart as a meat-free option. Sometimes people really do just want beautifully cooked, non-fussed-with veg. But my strongest memory of Liverpool on this visit – and it’s always the least expected thing when reviewing – was a plate (not a bowl, nor a ramekin) of lukewarm, decidedly unbeautiful rice pudding topped with pear steeped in Lillet vermouth. The rice was flavoured with tonka bean, an ugly-looking, raisin-like lump that enhances all food with a vanilla-y, liquoricey, caramelly and clove-esque aroma. Sure, it has been banned in the US since 1954 because large quantities of it can kill you and, yes, two 5g teaspoons of the stuff can reportedly see off a sheep, but, look, we’re all going to die some time. And I can think of no better eulogy than: “Grace passed away in Liverpool. She was quite tipsy. She had no shoes on, had just made friends with a labrador and was halfway through eating a tonka bean rice pudding. She died happy.” • Belzan, 371 Smithdown Road, Liverpool L15, 0151-733 8595.

All restaurants in 2018 must have a dish to provoke Instagram users. I don’t make these rules; I am but a conduit. You may recall Red Farm’s Pac-Man dumplings or Kerridge’s Bar &amp; Grill’s lobster omelette. And it is reported that at new Notting Hill mega-opening Caractere, Emily Roux is agitating – excuse me, enticing – diners with a Bourbon biscuit filled with mushed sardine butter. This, let’s be frank, sounds like something one might have been tricked to eat while blindfolded at an 1990s children’s birthday party. Hence, at Two Lights, a small, breaded sardine lies between two slices of purposefully bog-standard white bread, with its wispy tail draping out à la Tom &amp; Jerry’s supper. It’s a sardine katsu sandwich for £4.50, a play on Japanese junk food. In the maze of morality that is food-scene cultural appropriation, a loophole allows the Japanese to play with the drab 70s British way of making a sandwich and flog it back to us via Shoreditch. You eat this sardine sandwich in a rather noisy room with white brick walls and delightful service, as part of a menu of modern American sharing plates, hewn of intriguing, deeply pre-trend foodstuffs: hen-of-the-woods mushrooms, fennel pollen, bottarga butter, mussels served on a flatbread with brussels sprouts. Two Lights is an important London opening because Chase Lovecky is a young, earnest, imaginative chef known for his work at The Clove Club in Shoreditch, Momofuku-ko in New York and with Jean-Georges Vongerichten. Expect askew slants on seafood, Japanese influences, relaxed shack vibes and high-end American swagger. You may laugh at his dressed crab balanced precariously on two beef-fat chips or his spindly carrots draped beside duck, but these are dishes that other chefs will riff on, rip off or simply bitch about who invented them first. Maitake mushroom – a feathery, meaty, satisfying ’shroom that, as its nickname suggests, could be mistaken for chicken – is served with egg yolk and dulse, a seaweed that tastes a little of bacon. The dish costs £18.50, it is complex and elegant, yet at the same time, it is also the world’s most expensive quiche filling. This is a dinner that educates me, rather than one that makes me drool, but, marvellously, there will always be a place for this kind of thing in Shoreditch. We whip through dish after dish from the single-sheet, A5 menu printed on Farrow &amp; Ball Elephant Breath-coloured card. Soft potato rolls appear with a small pot of fishy bottarga butter, then the obligatory sardine sandwich – which is largely forgettable, but did its job of luring us through the doors. A whole roast artichoke arrives prettily with a sweet, sunflower-seed miso dip. We pull and dip, and pull and dip, then cut the soft innards, enjoying the ceremony possibly more than the vegetable itself. A wobbly, bulging burrata sits, ready to erupt, in a vibrant green, delicious puddle of creamed kale and seaweed. A highlight is delicate, lightly flamed slices of bonito topped with a splodge of American mustard and a suggestion of pickled onion. Still, the more I ate, the less convinced I became. Carbs are thin on the ground at Two Lights; their nods to “sides” are a lettuce wedge with a pale and interesting tarragon dressing or chunks of roast celeriac smeared with a walnut butter that is either revolting or revolutionary, which neither myself or my friend Lyndsay could decide on, despite clearing the plate. The grilled shortrib with sweet beetroots is gorgeous and a reassuring crowd-pleaser for guests not quite down with the whole WTF-ness of Lovecky’s vision. They may be a little more irked by his guinea fowl, which arrives in sausage form, cuddling into a bed of sausagemeat stuffing and a citrus yuzu sauce. Two Lights’ custard tart has also became Insta-famous, although it left me a little cold, much like its icy muscat grape granita and the pumpkin ice-cream with persimmon and popcorn. As Chas Hodge might have said if he’d seen me eating these puddings, “Oh darling, there ain’t no pleasing you.” But I’m still glad I went to Two Lights, and I’ll enjoy watching Chase Lovecky’s work filter through the country’s kitchens. I wasn’t sated, but I was educated, and that’s absolutely the next best thing. • Two Lights 28 Kingsland Road, London E2, 020-3976 0076. Open Weds-Sat, noon-2.30pm, 5.30-10.30pm, Sun noon-9.30pm.

She indicated that it would be a place of romantic bliss, orbiting like a “love satellite”. For me, though, heaven would look and feel a lot like one neverending overnight stay at Coombeshead Farm in north Cornwall: a self-sufficient, gaspingly tasteful, food-forward, wunderkind-chef-led passion project set in 60 acres of rolling, remote British rural splendour. For me, it’s our answer to Fäviken in northern Sweden or Dan Barber’s Blue Hill Farm in the Pocantico Hills, New York. This five-bedroom B&amp;B is a place to pull out of the bag when you need to save your marriage, because not only is it exclusive and exquisite, but both of you will have to be so much on your best behaviour in the communal drawing rooms, while eating ornate, wafer-thin Stithians cheese tart amuses bouches with the other eight guests, that you’ll remember why you fell in love in the first place. My heaven, where I will go for my good deeds in keeping your hearts alive with mirth and joy, will be waking eternally in pristine, quality bed-linen, with no phone signal – ergo no deadlines – to the smell of fresh, plump, Aga-hewn sticky lardy cakes and exemplary sourdough served with homemade rhubarb compote. A place where I can float through the working farmyard like a rested Sleeping Beauty, festooned in birdsong and sunlight. But this is not agriculture as I know it from my northern childhood, full of shit, death, afterbirth and inbred young men on quad bikes looking for a fox den to dig up. No, in my heaven – as it is at Coombeshead – all the unseemly bits of land management will take place out of my eyeline, and I will instead snack on polytunnel sunflowers dipped in fresh curds, be at one with the piglets, geese and bees, and my soul will feel as if it’s just had a bloody good jetwash, much like Coombeshead’s yard. I felt all of these emotions, and even weirder ones, for every breathing moment of my 17 hours as an inmate ... sorry, guest. I certainly remember shedding a bizarre and quite unexpected involuntary tear when I left. In fact, the more I think about it, I’m not entirely sure that Tom Adams hasn’t started a cult. You arrive around 4pm, but there is no reception desk. Tom, or someone else lovely, will wander over to your car, lure you into the kitchen, fix you a drink and show you your room, which will make Babington House feel gauche. Tom will waft an arm across the vast honesty bar, then tell you that pre-dinner snacks will begin around 6.30pm. On the May evening we ate there, dinner, served in an adjoining barn, and no longer communally and B&amp;Bers-only, as it was in the operation’s early days, started with said sourdough with Guernsey butter, a robust, no-holds-barred porky “country” terrine, a skewered lamb kidney with paprika and a plate of faultless green asparagus made devilish with brown butter. A whopping Looe diver scallop appeared in a seafaring, kelp-laden broth. We ate alongside Californians who had made a 600-mile detour from Europe, bankers and bespoke furniture makers. If the night had been written by Agatha Christie, one of us would have disappeared after every plate of fermented vegetables, puffed breads, cured pork belly or paper-thin fennel, each time leaving one foodie fewer to muse over Noma’s new summer vegetarian menu, until there were none. The main event was Waterloo Farm lamb with spring onion and wild garlic, or ramsons, as they call it at Coombeshead. Or weeds, as some readers would probably call it while wondering where the potatoes to go with the lamb were, or the carrots, red cabbage or mint sauce for that matter. But Coombeshead is not for that type of person. Even so, those people would adore the breakfast here. Yes, it is served communally. And yes, you do have to talk to other people about your day’s plans. But while the cooked breakfast of the freshest eggs, griddled home-cured pork belly bacon and sausage is prepared, the table just off the kitchen heaves with homemade bircher muesli, hazelnut granola, warm breads, and an embarrassment of gut-healing kombuchas and fruit smoothies. After breakfast, you will wander the farm’s many acres in a jocund manner, pointing at pleasant views, snuffling pigs and bumptious cockerels. You will pay your bill, hug people goodbye and go back to the real world. Your hire car will smell a little of sick and old Costa cups. The real world will feel cold, unkempt and distinctly non-heavenly. • Coombeshead Farm Lewannick, Launceston, Cornwall; 01566 782 009. Open dinner 7pm Thurs-Sun; 1pm Sun lunch.

Something often goes awry when a public house begins catering for mixed groups of toddlers, tweens, grans and friends with four legs. One size rarely fits all. “Pulled pork? Pghgh. Noooo! This place is your type of thing,” my octogenarian mother will groan, in tones heaving with Tony Soprano’s matriarch, Livia, whenever we tempt her to dinner. Likewise, only a sadist would by choice eat mozzarella sticks beside a slippery slide at a Brewers Fayre Fun Factory. So I love it when places, such as this pub I stumbled upon in Cornwall last half-term, find that precarious “family” balance. I was slightly late to the game, because The Mexico Inn has lived on Long Rock’s high street for 200 years, though the village itself is now circumnavigated by a fast, shiny bypass. Reportedly, its first landlord was a man called Bill who had spent time mining silver in Mexico. The locals’ nickname for the joint has clearly stood the test of time, but is perhaps unhelpful if you stop by hoping for enchiladas and tequila. Relax, students, there’s not a culturally inflammatory sombrero to be found here. In recent years, Tom and Amy Symons have taken The Mexico’s reins, after cooking in several of Cornwall’s more lauded spots, including The Gurnard’s Head in Zennor, The Old Coastguard in Mousehole and The Scarlet in Newquay. To me, The Mexico feels like what occurs when two people who are well acquainted with fancy and first-class dining shift gears to create the type of intensely relaxed, gastro-ish pub they’d like to hang out in themselves. The Mexico’s shelves heave with well-thumbed cookbooks, making the place pleasantly cluttered. Service is lovely: warm and knowledgeable. It’s as if they’re actually happy to see you. They serve viognier, picpoul de pinet and sticky, more-ish pedro ximénez by the glass. There are small nooks by the wood-burner for a solo pint with a newspaper, if you need refuge. Posters on the walls offer Tom’s fish and chips on “Chippy Tuesday”, and to takeaway if you can’t be bothered to be there at all. There’s a large table in a back room if you need to cater for a family rabble. They lure in punters with twists on pub classics made with produce sourced from local Penwith suppliers – burgers, pork loin, crumbles – and then wow them when the kitchen spits out little lovely extras such as freshly baked bread, crisp whitebait with a rich harissa mayo, sweetcorn fritters with runner-bean chutney or plates of ham hock flecked with tarragon. We began with some baskets of large tempura prawns sitting on the most wondrous beds of Asian-style slaw – sweet, nutty, fishy, sour, crunchy, healthy and whore-ish all at the same time. God’s own garnish. If I lived closer by, I’d consume this stuff by the bucket. Slow-cooked lamb shoulder came with a fragrant, Moroccan-influenced stew laden with apricot, almonds and squash and served with a freshly grilled flatbread. Music was Brit-pop classics to please the forty-somethings and the dishes that emerged from the kitchen were pretty enough to impress our tween’s Instagram followers, which was a huge relief to all the rest of us. My mother ate her brisket in a brioche roll avidly. It arrived dripping with Swiss cheese and onion relish, with a generous of bowl of fresh, skin-on chips on the side. I have not been so quietly ecstatic since I surreptitiously got her to try, and enjoy, ’nduja at Foxborough in Carlisle, for which I think the place should get a blue plaque. Fresh, crisp battered Newlyn Market hake arrived with mushy peas whiffing of malted vinegar and good, zingy tartare. These little things mean so much. Places like this are why I love Cornwall. This pub helped me get over the trauma of returning to Land’s End earlier that day for the first time in four decades, only to find that they’ve tarmac’d it over, built a shopping mall that sells personalised tat and Chicago Town pizzas – yes, really – and has a 3D cinema, playing, inexplicably, a Wallace and Gromit film. No, I don’t understand, either. But I do understand The Mexico Inn. It’s close to Long Rock beach and the coastal path. It serves thick chunks of fresh treacle sponge with clotted cream and custard, and its warm spiced apple crumble comes with a mascarpone ice-cream. It has Tia Maria and Kahlúa if your aunty fancies Irish coffee. This is isn’t a family fun-pub, but it’s definitely a fun pub for families. I know which I prefer. • The Mexico Inn 4 Riverside, Penzance Cornwall, 01736 710625. Open all week, lunch noon-2pm, dinner 6-9pm (5-8pm Sun).

Salad, main course and a side £17. Desserts £6. Wines (500ml) from £15 One summer, on holiday near Cahors on the Lot river, we found a red wine which we were convinced was the essence of the French good life with a cork in its neck. It reeked by turns of blackcurrant and paraffin, of the deep earth below and the blue sky above. It was a languid afternoon, bottled. We downed loads of it, until the collection of empties by the front door of our gîte looked like cause for a friendly intervention. The tiny winery responsible was close by and so naturally, hugging ourselves with joy at our good taste and sophistication, we bought a case and drove it all the way home to south London. Our little flat might have backed on to the dirty rumble and clatter of train tracks, but with the cork pulled on a bottle of this we would, for a few glasses at least, be back on our stone-flagged terrace, the southern French sun on our cheeks. Do I need to finish this story? Because you already know, don’t you? We did indeed pull the cork and fill our glasses. What we found was not an expression of the landscape. It was a mediocre, rather blunt red wine which, drunk in the arse end of Clapham, tasted not of sunshine but delusion. It took a long time to get through those bottles. Monsieur Le Duck, a new pop-up which will be in its present location near London’s Liverpool Street station until May, risks being the restaurant equivalent of that case of wine. Richard Humphreys worked amid the blinking computer terminals and paper drifts of the City but dreamed only of Gascony. He went there a lot. He loved their tiny restaurants. He loved what they did with ducks and red-and-white check. Why could there not be one of those places around the corner from his office? He decided to open one, which had the added advantage of requiring him to stop working in the office. The result could have been a disaster, an expression of one man’s doubts about his life choices, and who wants to go there for dinner? That it isn’t a disaster, that it’s delightful in a low-key, sweetly romantic way, should be attributed to the narrow frame they’ve set for themselves. It’s called Monsieur Le Duck because that’s what they do: a small number of duck dishes, a bit of salad and a couple of desserts to finish. I’ve admitted in the past that I’ve found the idea of going en vacances in rural France rather more engaging than the reality. You sit down in the charming local restaurant, and thrill to the menu of confit de canard and steak frites, salade aux lardons and crème brûlée. Night two is good, too, and night three OK. By night four what you wouldn’t do for a bit of bloody ramen or a rogan josh. It’s the downside to a robust culinary culture, these grinding menus of the same old. Think of Monsieur Le Duck as the first night of your French holiday to which you won’t return, perhaps for months. The modern space, a glass-walled addition to a pre-existing building, is floored in wood block. There are dainty red-and-white check curtains running along the length of the original building’s windows on the back wall, which don’t need to be there, but are nice to look at. There’s one long communal table down the middle, plus a bunch of two tops, a wine rack and tiny open kitchen with space for one cook and one bottle washer. They play Edith Piaf at you, as if it were part of the order of service. And no, I don’t regret anything either, Edith. Monsieur Le Duck is begging to be packed on Valentine’s night and most other nights, too. The menu is short. For £17 you get a mixed salad full of butch, hefty leaves and a light dressing to start, followed by one of the mains, plus a side. There are nutty puy lentils or green beans fried in garlic butter, seasonal greens with lardons or thin frites, a little potato skin clinging to their ends. All are exactly as you would wish them to be. And so, to the duck. Spoiler alert. If you don’t like duck, don’t come here. Likewise, if you do like ducks, but not dead, cooked ones, also don’t come here. This may seem obvious, but you can never underestimate the boundless stupidity of some people. It is offered four ways, three if you can’t quite tell the difference between the two ways with breast. All of them need a sprinkle of extra salt but it’s there on the table so I’m not whining. The breast, either grilled over coals or gently pan-roasted, is the deep purple inside of rare calf’s liver, as it damn well should be, with crisp skin, the fat almost fully rendered, as it also damn well should be. There’s a burger of minced duck, which is a couple of inches thick, pleasingly dense, and constantly on point to leak juices down your chin. Stand by with a napkin. All of this would be wasted effort if the duck confit wasn’t up to scratch, but it really is: crisp and bronzed and salty and rich. I imagine I’m meant to niggle that they don’t confit it themselves; they bring it from France. Then again if they’ve found the good stuff, why overcomplicate matters, especially at these prices? The real bargain is Le Grand Jeu, for two to share: a leg of confit, 100g of each way with the breast, a burger, two salads and two sides for £42. The non-meat option is described as a grilled winter vegetable tart, but could just as easily be listed under “will this do?”. It is a dense platform of just undercooked puff pastry, ungenerously hidden under some flaccidly roasted vegetable. In the sense that it represents perfectly a Gallic shrug of disdain for non-meat eaters, it is just as authentic as everything else here. Look, I am merely the reporter. As well as listing some of Gascony’s finest, they have a sturdy white, rose and red, at £15 for a 500ml carafe (equivalent to £22.50 for a standard bottle) which lubricates all of this. We finish with an exceedingly well-made crème brûlée, and a slice of apple tart with a scoop of crème fraîche which is all kinds of encouraging loveliness. Monsieur Le Duck could have been a terrible idea. It could have been one man’s mistake. Instead it’s a delightful night out. News bites If you like dinner with a French accent, try the Hero of Maida in west London, where the menu – like those at the group’s other pubs – is overseen by chef Henry Harris. It’s all here: celeriac remoulade with Bayonne ham, steak tartare, rabbit in a mustard sauce, chocolate mousse to finish. Harris ran the much-loved Racine and it’s a delight to see his menu return (theheromaidavale.co.uk). Chef Tommy Heaney, who competed recently in Great British Menu, has opened Heaney’s Restaurant in Pontcanna, Cardiff. Because it’s 2019, the menu offers plates for sharing including sea bass with celeriac and a sourdough broth, lamb with anchovy and sea vegetables, and fish beignets with curry and pomegranate (heaneyscardiff.co.uk). The very first Ed’s Easy Diner, which occupied a wedge-shaped corner site at the end of Old Compton Street in London’s Soho, has closed. It’s easy to forget just how radical and exciting Ed’s was when the late Barry Margolis opened it in 1987 – 24 other sites remain (edseasydiner.com).

Several times recently, as I’ve traversed Britain sprinkling happiness, the journey to the restaurant has been much more fun than dinner. The Severn &amp; Wye Smokery in Gloucestershire sits between two of these islands’ most celebrated, salmon-abundant rivers, and details of the fishery here can be found in the Domesday book. As I sat in the upstairs restaurant, picking at fried salmon skin and smoked sprats while surrounded by men in red trousers and blazers dining with their genteel elderly aunts, I thought to myself: “This is a pleasant place to motor towards from Hereford or Chipping Norton. If you, well, need something to do.” I’m not sure this was anyone’s mission statement when the smokery’s ambitious recent renovation began. Upstairs is a vast, semi-formal seafood restaurant and downstairs a cafe. There’s a large farmshop, too, complete with an impressive, glass-fronted fish shop. The smokery supplies Harrods, Fortnum &amp; Mason and the Royal Chelsea Flower Show; it exports to Bahrain, Singapore and the Sudan. They chip their own oakwood for smoking. They release their own elvers back to wetlands, to nurture eel stocks. On paper, then, everything about the place screams all-new Petersham Nurseries meets a charming Countryfile segment on British freshwater fishing meets the type of place Lynda Snell off the Archers takes you for a scone in a bid to bribe you into playing Suzuki in a culturally insensitive Ambridge take on Madame Butterfly. We start with forgettable “King’s cured smoked salmon” that comes tossed on to a plate with a handful of capers, and lukewarm salmon skin crackling that’s spongy and tastes of oil. Instantly, I feel somewhat worried. But the intensely smoked sprats are fantastic. Our request to try some of their famous eel in a dish that isn’t a creamy stew containing pork is met with a puzzled: “No, the pork is all mixed in.” This is a venue with huge potential that’s going completely to waste. If this multimillion-pound project were in London, you’d be met at the door by half a dozen keen things with hospitality management diplomas. You’d be rattled through the basic tenets of historical smoking methods, then offered a menu featuring six different ways with eel and elver. It would be a single sheet, but it would trumpet the fact that they have crevettes, sea bass, gilt-head bream, south coast squid, yellowfin tuna and a dozen other fresh fish on site, alongside proper fishmongers and enthusiastic chefs. The eel turns up masked by lardons, field mushrooms, cream and croutons that taste like butter-embossed Hobnobs. Oh, and a runny poached egg. You could hide a chopped-up flip-flop in this concoction and not notice it. The rock oysters are exquisitely sourced, which shows. We ask for them without accompaniments, but are ignored. A generous main of kedgeree comes brimming with smoked haddock, but still gives me no compulsion to eat much of it, not least because there is no sane place for chickpeas in a kedgeree, or wet spinach leaves, for that matter, or too much tomato, if, indeed, any at all. This is experimental jazz fusion kedgeree. We order turbot, too, because we’re from London and turbot is incredibly hip, so we just like saying the word. Thankfully, it’s exemplary: roasted on the bone, crisp-skinned, moist and alluring. The best things at Severn &amp; Wye are those they’ve had little to do with. A side of samphire comes thick with butter and salt, and sits forlornly alongside a ramekin of dauphinoise potato that should have been removed from the oven at around the same time as those Domesday inspectors came to town. Pudding is one of those deconstructed foams, sponges and smears, riffing around the theme of rhubarb, that I like making MasterChef contestants cry about. As is the case with this type of gubbins, the sum of its parts doesn’t add up to one decent pudding, plus it comes out of the kitchen within minutes of ordering. There is so much potentially to adore about this venture, but right now it feels like a gargantuan, directionless space that will please passers-by and locals, but won’t lure the foodie hordes from Bristol, Cardiff and London. They’ve spent a ton of money, yes, but right now it’s a fish out of water. • Severn &amp; Wye Smokery Chaxhill, Westbury-on-Severn, Gloucestershire, 01452 760191.

This is possibly the most pertinent question about chef Tom Kerridge’s glitzy new dining room in the 283-room, five-star Corinthia Hotel near Whitehall in London. So let’s just cut to the chase. What if I told you the fish is the finest, freshest, most ethical brill cocooned in a batter so crisp, it feels like a masterclass in whipping and dipping. Oh, and you eat the fish while Kerridge himself, the man off the telly, ambles jovially around his 90-cover fiefdom in chef’s whites. Plus, this fish arrives with a little pot of chips. Say, around 12 chips in all, but triple-cooked with an ethereal, golden shimmer, so that each one feels like a little earnest task at hand. A delicious task, yes, but these are not flippantly scoffed chips like the gargantuan, soft, soggy and fragrant pile you unwrap from the local chippy, stinking gloriously of malt, newsprint and Friday night. No, these are special, once-in-a-lifetime chips flanked by three delicate schooners of chunky tartare, pease pudding and the Matson spiced sauce previously seen at Kerridge’s two Michelin-starred Buckinghamshire pub, The Hand and Flowers, and which I’ll be so bold as to identify as a prim riff on the slightly radioactive but entirely delicious chip-shop curry sauce that the British, myself included, so love. Matson sauce, however, is a gentle tickle of your tastebuds, rather than a full-on, tonsil-jiggling snog. So, these are very good fish and chips – they were certainly intensely enjoyable – but are they worth just short of £33? I’ll leave that conclusion for you, the reader, because I know that many of you have a terrific sense of fun and goodwill over such matters. But if I was being very mischievous, I’d drop in a note, oh, about here, about the “starter” of glazed omelette lobster thermidor, which is as big as a coaster and costs £29.50. But I shan’t be antagonistic. My more reasonably priced starter, “Claude’s mushroom risotto with Daniel’s crispy egg and aged parmesan”, was a less eye-watering £12.50. The two men namechecked are Claude Bosi of Bibendum and Daniel Clifford of Midsummer House, and the dish is a nod to their influences. Or, perhaps, a copyright lawsuit-avoidance plan. It’s most definitely a rice-free “risotto” of finely chopped oyster and button mushrooms, laced with chives and a lot of cream, and topped with a soft-yolked egg encased in a crisp, battered skin. The truth is, I was delighted with everything I ate, from the black treacle soda bread to the tiny spoons of malted milk ice-cream I stole off my friend Will’s plate while he wasn’t looking. If Kerridge, as a diet guru, wishes us as a nation to shed pounds, he fails miserably here, because this is a menu that lends itself to letting go. Kerridge’s Bar &amp; Grill is a big, broad and brassy birthday treat-type of restaurant. There’s a grand, but decidedly jolly, David Collins-designed dining room, with a rotisserie to gawp at and art to admire, and a short, alluring menu of big British crowd-pleasers. Aside from the punchy prices, which might test the limits of Uncle Brian’s beta blocker prescription so much he’ll need a stent, Cornish crab vol-au-vents and a coronation chicken terrine sit beside pig’s cheek pie and, Will’s choice, a masterful beef rib with bone marrow sauce and gherkin ketchup. Nine starters, 10 mains and a short dessert list featuring a soft, yielding, sky-high blackcurrant souffle with a ginger parkin crumb crust and a scoop of sharp, lemon sherbet-sprinkled blackcurrant leaf ice-cream that was as joyful as it was aggressive. We drank Limney Horsmonden Davenport from East Sussex by the glass and listened to Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds on the stereo. This is a British restaurant that celebrates British things in a charming and non-laboured manner. Perhaps Kerridge’s Bar &amp; Grill is the best possible example of restaurantland after Brexit: a paradise of well-off folk blowing large amounts of spare cash on our small island’s bounteous and most celebrated produce – on its Loch Duart salmon, its Creedy Carver duck and its Ramsbury Estate venison. In a post-Europe landscape, we’ll drink only Denbies red wine from the vineyards of Dorking and eat fish and chips off fancy plates while listening to vintage Arctic Monkeys. That all sounds rather pleasant, but on the off-chance it doesn’t come to fruition, I am still stockpiling Heinz spaghetti hoops. • Kerridge’s Bar &amp; Grill The Corinthia, 10a Northumberland Avenue, London WC2, 0207 321 3244.

Small plates £4.80-£7.50, big plates £7.90-£11.20, wine from £16.50 a bottle These are complex times for Britain’s Chinese restaurants. I know this because recently I sat on a panel about their future at Asia House in London. For the most part I was listening to my fellow panellists, Andy Kwok of the Good Earth group, and the uber-restaurateur Alan Yau, who set up Hakkasan, Yauatcha and Park Chinois among others. I contributed memories of the Chinese restaurants along Queensway in the early 1970s, where chefs stood in the windows pulling noodles as a kind of come-hither culinary theatre; they talked brutal economic and business realities. On the one hand the opening up of China has resulted in a glorious flowering in the variety of Chinese food available in Britain’s cities. We have gone from the days of the orange and the sticky, a disfigured approximation of Cantonese food, to the fiery hit of Sichuan and Hunan, through to the soupy dumplings of Shanghai and the cumin-crusted meat skewers and ribbon noodles of northern China. If you’re a bit handy with a pair of chopsticks these are great times to be alive. That is the frothy excitement. The bed rock of the sector, those original Cantonese restaurants, are in peril. While there have been Chinese eateries in Britain since the 18th century, they expanded after the Second World War with an influx of immigrants from China. Most went into the restaurant business because few other options were available. Those original Cantonese chefs are now retired or deceased, and they wanted more for their kids, who in any case probably didn’t fancy the long hours. As Asian economies have boomed chefs from China no longer feel the need to make their living here. In any case British immigration rules are hardly hospitable. Alan Yau was blunt. These days when he launches restaurants they’re in Asia – he described it as “a hobby” – and said it was impossible to find the staff here in the UK. Andy Kwok said the solution was simple: non-Chinese chefs had to be trained up in the techniques and skills. That, however, is a long game. Looking for reassurance that all was OK, at least for the moment, I went direct from the event to Wentworth Street in London’s Spitalfields, home to the extravagantly named Xi’an Biang Biang Noodles, a sibling to the nearby Sichuan Folk. It takes its name and most of its food from the capital of Shaanxi Province in northwestern China, where wheat fields win out over rice fields, leading to a noodle culture. I say most of its food, because at the back of the menu, under the heading “others” is sweet and sour chicken, an Essex tan shade of orange, alongside egg fried rice and veg spring rolls. Those are specifically targeted at people who don’t really want to be here. The rest of it is a brilliant slap around the chops. It’s a nine-napkin job: for the splashes of chilli oil-boosted sauces that could take out a white shirt at 10 paces, and for the dribbles of sweat. These are all good things. Fittingly, for such noisy, fighty food, the space is a big, brightly lit canteen, with wipe-down tables and blown-up Chinese picture-book illustrations on the walls. While the main plates can be for sharing they also work well for one and there was a pleasing number of solo diners with a book and a beer. I always think better of restaurants where people feel comfortable eating alone. The menu comes with gloriously garish pictures which should be my guide. Then again, we have our waiter, who has a point of view. I point at a chicken dish. He shakes his head. “Have the beef.” I ask why. He tells me it’s better. I can’t quite muster an argument. I move on to a bowl of seafood. He points at a violently shimmering image of noodles in vegetable broth instead. It seems he is in charge. He allows me to choose between spicy and sour and just spicy. I choose the former. He says I should have the latter, but oh well. We start with cold dishes. There’s a plate of slippery black fungus with chilli, coriander and vinegar which is an alarm clock for the tongue. The menu description includes the word “refreshing”, and I can do no better. Next to it is a plate of something altogether darker and more intense: long-braised beef served cold, in chilli oil with numbing peppercorns and pieces of cucumber and spring onion. It is luscious and compelling. We also get a light chicken broth with pork and vegetable wonton. When your next cold hits you will want to be eating this. It’s your mum’s hug in a bowl. The beef and noodle dish our man ordered us to have is a great call. Piled on the plate like this, ribbon noodles have a tangled, bleached offal look, as if they were innards. Don’t let me put you off. These ribbon noodles are absurdly satisfying: broad, slightly misshapen, slicked in fragrant oils and flakes of chilli. They are the very definition of joyous slurp. The second dish comes with thinner hand-pulled noodles, in a dark and powerful hot and sour broth, bobbing with chickpeas and brassic greens. There is no way to eat this food elegantly so don’t bother trying. Just get your mouth over the bowl, lift the noodles and suck. Festoon yourself in napkins tucked into every crevice of your clothing as if you are trying to mitigate the impact of a blast zone, which in a way you are. We finish with a plate of crunchy steamed greens in garlic sauce, and the sense that our waiter has done us proud. The drinks list is short, mostly beers and a couple of sturdy serviceable wines. Ignore the dessert list. It’s a laminated card of things which look like they might have been unloaded from one frozen environment to another. Just wander up the road to the increasingly glossy Spitalfields covered market, and satisfy your sweet tooth there. Xi’ian Biang Biang Noodles – it ought to be a song lyric –feels like it has been engineered for the current economic circumstances. It’s a utilitarian, great value enterprise posited on high-volume trade. What matters is the uncompromising punch of the cooking. I left thinking all really was well in the world of London’s Chinese restaurants. At least for now. Jay’s news bites Laksamania recently opened on London’s Newman Street and is getting attention for all the right reasons: their Singapore laksa, just one of six on offer, is deep and rich, made with two types of noodles, fully garnished and exactly the thing as we head into autumn. I also adored their crisp chicken wings and their bao, stuffed with slow cooked, glazed pork belly (laksamania.co.uk).

So, while Jamaicans have been audibly irked by Jamie Oliver’s jerk rice, and the Japanese take umbrage over our cackhanded tribute to katsu, the Spanish have stayed shtum about the piles of oily patatas bravas and pil pil prawns presented along Britain’s high streets as “a real taste of Catalonia”. It’s almost as if they’ve enjoyed the 40-year self-own. “Let them eat their king edward patatas doused in ketchup and chilli flakes!” they seem to have laughed since the 70s. “Give them their chor-it-so boiled in red wine with garlic bread to dip!” All this, however, makes it trickier for delicate, thoughtful, educational places such as Tast to tempt in large crowds in 2018. And this it will need to keep bums on seats across its capacious three floors. Tast is a high-end, imaginative, occasionally edgy “taste of the Catalan kitchen” by Paco Pérez, a chef of two Michelin-star calibre. In the “pinya” level, on the ground floor, we sit along Scandi benches and order a couple of tramuntanades – small-bite dishes from Pérez’s restaurant Miramar in Girona: “Duck’in Donut” and “sandwich de formatge trufat”. The former is an Instagram bear trap: a small doughnut filled with foie gras mousse, dipped lightly in white chocolate and dusted with vivid powdered raspberry. It costs £3.80 and tastes like a satanic Quality Street. The trufat, a cheese and truffle sandwich, is two tiny pieces of geometrically askew, prawn crackery-style meringue sandwiched together with an inner layer of tou de til-lers cheese and confit truffle. The innards are a feisty slap of cheesy, feety funkiness. The whole thing tastes, I imagine, like a Tuc sandwich cracker would if you’d been on Bear Grylls’ island for four weeks. Whether I would want to eat either of these things again is debatable, but if Pérez’s intention was to bring elements of Catalonian molecular gastronomy to King Street in Manchester, well, he can consider that a job boxed off. In the pinya level, guests are invited to range freely over the single-sheet menu of plates divided into sea, land, garden and bakery. Upstairs, there’s a more formal dining room, and a private dining area that promises to take guests “on a culinary adventure across Catalonia, on a journey for the senses”, which to me reads as “similar dishes but with more waiter chat, served with bigger gaps” – a sentence that, after years in this job, I find, as the kids say, deeply triggering. On safer ground, namely the ground floor, we range through half a dozen or so plates. A long, sweet slice of tomato-topped coca bread comes doused with olive oil that’s poured theatrically from a glass teapot: warm, fresh and crunchy, it’s devoured and we order another. Aubergine chips, for want of a closer description, arrive on a bowl that looks like an emoji. They’re drizzled with a dud anchovy mayo, molasses and sesame, and are oddly moreish while not being entirely delicious. Red pepper croquetas, however, are fantastic: fluffy, crunchy and with heavenly, sweet innards. They’re a true work of art. Still, we are now 50 minutes into lunch and Tast has never quite stopped being dainty and somewhat muted. A larger bowl of shredded king crab appears in a pink, wobbly, marie-rose-flavoured blancmange, to be eaten, I supposed, with a spoon, just like Angel Delight. A plate of monkfish appears. Or, rather, four small pieces of cold monkfish and three prawns on chilled, rather anonymous, beige sauce flecked with a saffron mayo that is saffron only in colour. It is one of those lunches I call time on – we have eaten and eaten and not really eaten – so I go straight to puddings, which are where glory lies. Xuixo de crema is showstopping: a warm, plentiful wodge of fresh puff pastry filled with custard, and lying in a slovenly manner in a puddle of dark chocolate. We order crema catalana, too – a rather humble-sounding vanilla custard with a smattering of berries – and end up talking about it for days. We eat in the window, where tourists pose for pictures beside Pep’s “new signing”. I leave feeling that Tast is important, uncompromising, at times lost in translation and possibly not all that much fun. And perhaps, like many wonderful, authentic foods from other cultures, we probably don’t quite deserve it. • Tast 20-22 King Street, Manchester M2, 0161-806 0547.

Snacks and starters £2.50-£6.50. Mains £8.50-£13.95. Wines from £16.50 Marcel Proust had his madeleine. For me, it’s the BBQ ribs at the Wok Inn Seaside Noodle Bar, Blackpool. They are long and slender and drenched in a glossy sauce the colour of the varnish on an expensive hotel lobby coffee table; it’s all shiny mahogany with a touch of gold and orange. They seem to come with their own internal stage lighting system. These are Cantonese spare ribs as they used to look when I was a kid, before fashion intervened and insisted that the dark sticky version of Chinese food with which we were familiar was somehow unsophisticated and unwanted. They are very much still wanted, mostly by me. The meat pulls from the bone with a gentle tug. The sauce coats my lips and cheeks. Sugar surges through my veins. All of a sudden, I am seven years old again. This makes a kind of sense for its full name is Michael Wan’s Wok Inn Seaside Noodle Bar, referencing one of Britain’s most venerable Cantonese restaurants, established in the centre of Blackpool in 1961 and still trading to this day. This new venture, from the next generation of the family, is located on the seafront opposite the entrance to the North Pier. It’s a boon to the city. Blackpool is an extraordinary and compelling place in so many ways, with a rich history. I’ve had fabulous nights there. I will not quickly forget my encounter with a 6ft 8in drag queen called Miss Zoe at the nightclub Funny Girls, who took to the PA to thank me publicly for coming and for all my “wonderful stock cube recipes”. But nobody has ever described Blackpool as a beacon of gastronomy. It has other things on its mind, most of them filthy. In the words of a friend who once worked in the mass catering trade, in Blackpool if it floats, it’s done. There’s toothsome rock, marvellous Italian ice cream and a veritable plethora of fine deep-fried items. It gives the air along the front a distinctive tang. And now there’s this place, which the owners describe as a cross between a Budapest ruin bar and a Penang hawker centre. I’ve never been to either, but I appreciate the garishly decorated corrugated iron on the walls, the customised beer bottles on the shelves, the vintage Asian posters and the shrine to the phallus in the loos. Because obviously all restaurant loos need one of those. When the women in our group come back from theirs, thrilling to the glass-fronted case containing a mighty erection, alongside posters detailing phallus worship the world over, I become curious as to what I would find in the men’s. More of the same, I’m afraid. It’s a riot of phalli. Smash the patriarchy, and all that. The menu back upstairs is of a sort that I have often raged about. It wanders Asia, like a backpacker on the run. Few kitchens can really manage all these varied traditions and to a small extent, that is still true here. The ramen is merely fine. If you wanted to soothe a raging cold, it would be an option. But the things they do well are so very good and in places so utterly beguiling that it makes up for the duff notes. Plus, it’s all so joyous and enthusiastic and brave. They are being self-consciously different, down here on the promenade where the last of the illuminations sway in the breeze. I am lost in admiration for a restaurant in such a location which would put a dish of salt and chilli duck tongues on the menu so brazenly. For the uninitiated, duck tongues have a piece of cartilage right down the middle, requiring you to drag the tender meat off with your teeth. They come spiced and lightly battered; it is Blackpool after all. They are the meaty equivalent of the pistachio nut, with its meditative process of deshelling. Clench your teeth and drag, clench and drag. Oh, stop squirming. The duck has died; far better to eat all of it. Alongside those spare ribs, there are plump, crisp-bottomed pork gyoza, impeccably pleated at their edges, and crisply fried chicken wings with sesame seeds and a sweet chilli glaze. There are pert and bouncy Thai fishcakes with a seriously zippy dipping sauce, and florets of bang bang cauliflower with yet more chilli. In an act of culinary wanderlust, they make their own fragrant and punchy cabbage kimchi. They roast monkey nuts in the shell. But these are only the curtain raisers. The stars of the piece are the main courses listed under “Around Asia”, many of which are served in brightly painted stacked tiffin boxes. I’d say “take the beef rendang”, but I don’t want you to take it, because it’s mine. All mine. You lift the lid on the first layer and are hit by a massive blast of freshly roasted spices. It’s not just the tiffin tins that are multi-layered. It is one of those deep savoury curries which goes on and on. The gravy is so intense that you crave something to mop it up with to the very last stain against the shiny metal. That’s all right because in the next layer there’s a flaky multi-leaved roti canai. It is a true wonder of flat bread baking: buttery, a little singed, lacy and layered and an utter delight. (You can have one as a starter, with a dish of curry sauce for dipping in.) The third layer contains a generous dome of steamed rice and below that is a sweetly dressed crunchy salad. For £12.90 it’s both an awful lot of dinner and an awful lot of fun. You pick here, spoon there, fork away and combine. A massaman chicken curry, which they describe as “old skool Asian fusion”, courtesy of its Persian, Malay and Indian roots, is no less thrilling or stacked. It is ripe with coconut and peanut and more roasted spice; with the soothing starch of potato and lip-smacking gelatine which only comes with the long cooking of meat on the bone. With this we drink both chilled bottles of Tiger beer and warmed sake, a combination which seems to make sense. It comes as little surprise to learn they don’t do desserts. It’s just not a big part of whichever culture they happen to be representing. No matter. We just order a second portion of the spare ribs, and reminisce about the Cantonese restaurants of our childhood. And we are happy. News bites Over on the east coast at Cromer is Galton Blackiston’s Upstairs at No 1, which is equally eclectic. The menu is absurdly varied and yet it works. Their ramen is a monster of a thing, with every possible bell and whistle. Try their Baja fish tacos with pea mole, the flatbreads with lamb shawarma, and don’t miss the mushy pea croquettes (no1cromer.com). Our thoughts are with chef Andrew Fairlie, who is stepping away from the two Michelin star restaurant at Gleneagles that carries his name, following a terminal diagnosis. Fairlie, the first ever winner of the Roux scholarship in 1984, was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2005. Ennismore, owners of Gleneagles, has renewed the restaurant’s contract under head chef Stevie McLaughlin (andrewfairlie.co.uk). Consistency is a virtue, but perhaps not for Brittania Hotels which has been named the worst UK hotel chain for the sixth year running in a Which? survey.

Ynyshir is a country house set in 11 acres just south of the Snowdonia National Park, and outwardly it offers a cacophony of reasons to stay at home. It’s a Welsh/Japanese-influenced, Michelin-starred restaurant that focuses on fatty meat, fermentation and pickling. It required me to take a 400-mile round trip and offered only a 19-course tasting menu. Dinner, I was told, would last a minimum of four hours. No menu was available to preview; it would be a surprise. And only the unhinged enjoy surprises. Now, I’m not saying that chef Gareth Ward is unhinged, but he’s certainly a one-off. His website gives a lacklustre nod to “dietary requirements”, but you need to telephone to ask. But I’d read an interview with Ward in which not only did he resemble a Game of Thrones-style titan who’d squeeze a rival’s eyes out of their head just for sport, but also had deeply non-PR-friendly opinions: “People say you should cook for your customers. I say fuck that. I cook for myself.” I decided against calling ahead to suggest my tips for braising tofu. Ynyshir is a “restaurant with rooms”, and very beautiful ones they are, too, but it’s not a hotel (you may stay only one night), they don’t do room service, or burgers in the bar, or any bar menu at all, for that matter. Breakfast, rather heroically, is served at 9am the next morning, and not until 9am. Gareth will cook eggs and bacon at 9am, and you’re either in or you’re out. The sheer obstreperousness of it all made me hellbent on visiting Planet Gareth, and I’m so very glad I did. Because there’s a good reason that, in just 18 months, Ynyshir has found a place on every restaurant list worth its salt. Actually, salt is another tricky subject with Gareth Ward. He hasn’t spent all that time vibing on miso, wagyu, pickled elderflowers, pata negra or Welsh seaweed for you to start hurling about handfuls of Saxa. He has not shifted an entire kitchen away from traditional demi-glaces and stocks, and instead steamed full force into a culinary landscape flavoured with pickled leaves, rotting roots, fruit stocks or mackerel bones, only for you to show up asking for the big black pepper grinder. Our opening course, named “Not French Onion Soup”, is a silken rabbit punch of miso, fermented fruit, seaweed and shiso-pickled vegetables. It’s sublime and unforgettable, albeit so rich, it couldn’t be consumed in a quantity larger than a child’s teacup. It is very much a taste of things to come. Although, admittedly, by the time that soup was served, I’d already fallen madly in love with the place. It takes a brass neck to convert an ancient, remote country house into a stripped-back modern space that plays MC5 and Arctic Monkeys on vinyl and serves tiny mouthfuls of crab claw with katsu ketchup, followed by cured mackerel with eel on nori seaweed alongside rhubarb anointed with cultured butter. But there’s something so totally righteous about all this incongruousness. Indeed, at times, this feels like a physical assault of a menu. Nothing over the first 14 or so courses is creamy or soothing: lamb saddle is flavoured with kombucha, while a riff on Welsh cawl features fermented mussels, raw asparagus and dashi. An Isle of Wight tomato salad offers no refuge: the fruits are dehydrated, then laced with rapeseed oil. A barbecued prawn is cooked three ways, then infused with wild garlic and yet more pickles. A slice of wagyu with fermented lettuce gives way to a plate of duck mousse with birch sap and smoked eel. Still, one feels like a bigger person afterwards for enduring all this boldness. Ynyshir’s small team are a hugely lovable bunch, too: earnest, sparkly-eyed and clearly very excited to work here and talk animatedly about draining local birch trees of their sap, gathering nettles or the current age of the kitchen’s wagyu supply (a clock on the wall marks this to the nearest second). All wines are available by the glass, and there’s no sommelier at all, because every single one of the floor staff knows their stuff. A fire pit smoulders outside the front porch, and guests drift there from time to time to take stock of the madness. Each of the six puddings was a triumph. A bedazzling take on tiramisu made of frozen mascarpone and marsala was simply glorious; a riff on sticky toffee pudding that featured medjool dates was even better. What Ward is doing down in the Dyfi Valley is unique. It will surprise me if he stays with only one star. Gareth Ward cooks for himself, not the customers, and long may his delicious pigheadedness continue. • Ynyshir Eglwys Fach, Machynlleth, Powys, 01654 781209. Open Tues-Sat, lunch and dinner.

Small dishes £7-£10.50. Large dishes £10-£14. Dessert £4. Wines from £18 Once upon a time the Urchin was called the Bell and before that, the Belfast after its street address in Hove, which is definitely not Brighton, even if you can’t see the join. You only need look at the architecture to see the role it once played: it’s a block of a building on a corner site, surrounded by terraces of simple, flat-fronted houses. This pub was once the classic extension to the domestic; the living space outside the home in which everybody congregated. If you lived here and your dad went AWOL, it was probably worth looking in the Bell first. These past three years the Urchin has been a seafood gastropub, selling shelves of craft beers and things that once swam. Some will find this infuriating. I’ve been doing this so-called job for almost two decades and in all that time the narrative has been a constant: how dare they take our pubs? The identity of “they” being unclear, but almost certainly including me. How dare they bring in interior designers and menus of edible food that didn’t arrive frozen in the back of a truck? How dare they sell beers with names that only people who are too young to remember Margaret Thatcher as prime minister would find funny? Young people. With their beards and rising hormone levels. Smell my sarcasm. And yet I do get it. Restaurants, and eating out in general, have become part of a culture war. I can argue that the very people who criticise those of us who spend sizable sums on dinner will not think twice about spending the same dosh on tickets to a football game. That only emphasises the gulf. And don’t even think about arguing that old pubs have died because of economic imperatives or supply and demand. People like me, making those arguments, are still so far up ourselves we can see daylight through our open, greedy, sauce-slicked mouths. It’s about tribes (though yes, of course, the Venn diagram overlaps; you can both like eating out and buying tickets to Premiership matches). There is a tribe that will hate the idea of the Urchin. I’m not a member of that tribe. Partly this is because I was never interested in pub culture or, to be more exact, pre-1990s pub culture. Rip out the sticky carpets, sand down the floorboards and scribble up a blackboard menu full of sexy buzz words like “’nduja” and “salsify” and I’m there, dribbling. But please don’t ask me to nurse a pint. It’s not part of my skill set, this whole pint-nursing business. Mine’s a rosé and I won’t apologise for it, even as that culture war rages around me. I’m also not part of the tribe, because a) I love seafood and b) the Urchin does its thing with gusto. The cooking, like its decor, is rough-hewn and self-consciously so. Filament lightbulbs dangle from hefty ropes of the sort that boats tie up with. None of those ropes have ever seen a boat. The front room has high counters for eating at and in the back room, a few sea-green leather banquettes. There is a short paper menu, supplemented by a changing blackboard menu. The food walks a jagged line between standard British coastal seafood cookery – oysters, potted crab – and something with its eye fixed firmly on southeast Asia. This can lead to what looks like repetition but might just be regarded as experimentation by the kitchen. The main menu offers salt-and-pepper squid, because it’s become a British classic. Very good it is, too: crisp, greaseless, punchy on the seasoning without being overwhelming. There are tentacles as there must always be. The blackboard offers squid karaage, the Japanese preparation usually involving chicken thigh which is first marinated in soy, garlic and mirin before being dredged in cornflour and deep fried. Chicken is easy to marinate; squid less so. It’s the wipe-clean kitchen surface of food. Everything slides off it. And yet somehow it works. The squid is darker, more savoury, more intense. A similar duplication comes with the offer of both kung pao or Malaysian prawns. With both you get a serious portion of meaty crevettes in deep wells of thick sauce for £14. They are served in handsome, beaten copper-coloured bowls, with domed lids which double as receptacles for the emptied shells. I think it’s meant to be an either/or choice, rather than a “both please” situation. The kung pao prawns in a strident sweet-sour concoction are fine, but the Malaysian prawns, in a deep curry-spiced version with a ballast of soft nutty lentils at the bottom, are all swoon and ahh. When we have worked our way through the seafood bit of the dish, we take to dredging our perfectly crisp chips through the remaining sauce. Lo, we have done to chips with curry sauce what has already been done to the pub itself. We have upgraded it, and given it a glossy finish, which some might find equally irritating. Shup up. I’m eating. For £8 there is a heap of clams in a forceful broth of tomato and chorizo, with the sweet, briny kick from the liquor the molluscs release as they open. Mussels the colour of tangerines come in a beer broth with chunks of bacon and strands of crisped onions. There are crab cakes spiced with fresh chilli which are heavy on the meat. A jar of potted crab is a little underseasoned, but still disappears quickly enough. The only misstep is the one dessert, a vanilla panna cotta with a blackberry compote, it has been made with so much gelatine, you could scoop it out and play squash with it. Our spoon bounces off the surface. Their beer selection, arranged on a set of shelves next to the bar, complete with brown labels for inspection, is a fine thing. The labels carry legends like “Wild Beer Epic Saison”, “Crate Citra Sour” and “Burning Sky” as if it’s a game of word dissociation. They also make their own beer, Larrikin, on site. I do love a sub-culture, but it’s also worth knowing they have a well-priced wine list. They have an outside terrace, and you could come here and nurse that pint. Despite appearances it really is still a pub. But if you didn’t have the Malaysian prawns, with a side of chips, you’d be missing out. Just whisper the words “chips with curry sauce” to yourself. News bites The Old Passage is an inn on the banks of the River Severn specialising in seafood cookery. Go there for fritto misto or a classic fish soup, followed by lemon sole with brown butter and Jersey royals, or a whole lobster from their own seawater tank. The £65-a-head fruits de mer includes lobster, crab, oysters and a selection of prawns many and various (theoldpassage.com). In the summer I wrote positively about Tozi in London’s Victoria, though I did note the hard acoustics. A couple of months before I had written about a company called Tile Acoustics which was installing noise-reducing panels in restaurants. Tozi has now employed Tile Acoustics to deal with their sound issues. I love it when two stories come together. It’s a restaurant merry-go-round in Manchester. Following the news that chef Aiden Byrne had left 20 Stories, he’s now returning to the recently closed Manchester House, which was where he was when he was hired by 20 Stories.

In Ealing, west London, the folk behind the recently re-loved walled kitchen garden within Pitzhanger Manor, built circa 1800, have aimed much higher than this. Soane’s Kitchen is an elegant, bright, airy, beautifully situated space promising breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner, all of which, the menu promises, are so seasonally sensitive and ethically sourced that one ascends spiritually to a higher plane merely by eating its beans on toast. Sorry – its homemade, bloody mary-flavoured beans on Hedone sourdough, topped with a Breckland Brown egg squeezed from the hind portions of an ecstatic Norfolk free-range chicken. In the evening, there’s the likes of tempura shrimp burger served on a squid ink-coloured bun, and gluten-free rump of Paley Farm lamb with aubergine puree for £17.50, while your new potatoes to go with that will cost an extra £3.50. The menu, filled with labneh, focaccia crisps, beef tartare and zero-waste chimichurri, reminds me of that great Victoria Wood sketch where she takes her ancient mum to a trendy organic vegetarian cafe and the pair attempt laboriously to place their order. Wood, with her usual wit, nails just how non-inclusive these supposedly all-inclusive spaces actually are for the old, the uncool and the moderately waged. And, in Soane’s Kitchen’s case, non-inclusive to those without a booking, because on the Sunday lunch I went there at 1pm, the place was deserted and, at the same time, under heavy demand for tables. Locals ambled in every five minutes, casting hopefully around the empty tables, looking for sustenance, only to be told that the joint was fully booked. Predictably, the room then remained relatively quiet over lunch, because essentially human beings are awful and make bookings they can be bothered to neither honour nor cancel, ruining the vibe and decimating the profits of new openings such as this across the land. I ask for a lunch menu, and I’m delivered a tiny brunch menu. It’s 1.15pm and I’m told that lunch is off due to a mysterious power problem. I accept this as fact, inform my guest when she appears, and we pick from an A5 menu of eggs, granola and sandwiches on which the “Soane’s full English” and the fishfinger sandwich with pea puree seem the best options. As we wait, we notice other tables receiving plates from the lunch menu, at which point I realise that my guest and I have been in possession of different brunch menus anyway. Mayhem such as this, which I experience very, very often, is tricky for the critic: it comes across as petty and unsympathetic and, at worst, it loses people jobs. But here I am, nevertheless, at lunch, without lunch. I make the best of things by ordering a bloody mary from their advertised “bloody mary counter”, which I cannot see and may or may not exist, because by this stage I am very confused. The fishfinger sandwich arrives. It is untoasted, rather dry sourdough concealing three soggy cod goujons swamped in unseasoned pea puree. Not mushy peas. No, these are garden peas shoved in a blender without seasoning. The tartare sauce tastes of very little. The full English is, of course, beautifully sourced, but a drab, sterile affair to look at, with everything placed centimetres apart. We ask for salt and pepper. Twice. My bloody mary appears: it contains a single, quill-like leaf of fried kale. Some pleading and wrangling gets us puddings: a Celebrity MasterChef-style dense chocolate tart with soggy pastry and a roasted peach with an abrasive thyme yoghurt. “Are you enjoying the puddings?” I’m asked by two different people. I can stay silent no longer. “No, this yoghurt is completely awful,” I say as the server retracts like a threatened sea anemone. “It has much, much too much thyme in it. It needs to be subtle, almost neutral, because the peach is steeped in honey.” “Thank you for your feedback. I will pass this on to the kitchen,” she says, sounding winded. There are no winners in the complaining game. Stay shtum, and you’re complicit; speak up, and you’re that choppy-bobbed woman in the internet meme asking to “see the manager”. I smoothed things over by ordering a glass of cloudy, orange Baglio Bianco Ciello 2016 and drinking it enthusiastically, although, in truth, it tasted a little gravelly. The main thing is, I showed willing. I’ll go back once everything gets better. • Soane’s Kitchen Walpole Park, Mattock Lane, London W5, 020-8579 2685.

A la carte (three courses) £55. Limited lunch menu (three courses) £24. Tasting menu £65. Wines from £23 A brutally cold winter’s day in Harrogate or, as it’s known in Yorkshire at this time of year, a Friday. My train has been delayed. We have called ahead to explain why we will be 30 minutes late but no matter, we are here now. We are ready for lunch. The question is, when will it begin? And will I ever thaw out? I look around the brightly lit dining room of Restaurant 92 and spot a couple of electric heaters pointed at two of the three occupied tables, their LEDs flashing prettily. Ours is not one of the tables to be so blessed. We are cold and we are hungry. For a long while, it appears we will stay that way. I ask politely whether we might get some bread, just to see us through the wait for the starters. The waiter tells us, equally politely, that there will be bread. He says it in a manner that indicates they have a plan which they are sticking to. All anybody wants to know when they enter a restaurant is that, in return for their money, everything will be OK. We want to know this very quickly. But quick, along with warm, does not appear to be on the agenda today. It takes 20 minutes from our arrival for that bread to turn up and another 15 after that to see the canapés. These are long waits in a chilly room. Did I mention the temperature? For now, I will stop being distracted by these things, at least here in print if not back there in the room. Head chef Michael Carr is a talented cook. He is only 24, but has already worked in some serious kitchens. He does not prioritise prissy visuals over flavour, and he has some fun ideas. There is a largesse and enthusiasm to his food. He takes admirable risks. The problem is that he’s charging £55 for three courses, which is a slab of anybody’s money, especially in a room like this where the big light is on and the radiators are off. It does not leave space for mistakes. Three courses at Röski in Liverpool a few weeks ago was £45. That was faultless. This really isn’t. The issue is unevenness. Here, the bread is to be taken seriously. It isn’t just something to get you through. It is a moment. It must be explained, which it is, in detail. On one side of the platter is a “chicken fat” brioche with a scoop of whipped butter, flavoured with beef dripping and dusted with onion powder. It’s animal fat-tastic. If you like your bread to have once had legs, feathers, fur and a pulse, it’s the bread course for you. It is luscious: there’s a light buttery brioche and a whipped butter that could be used as a seasoning or, alternatively, a massage oil. But then there’s the other side of the plate that carries triangular crackers crusted with rosemary and a ramekin of taramasalata to dredge them through. It’s all wrongness. The tarama is so acidic it tastes like tomato ketchup, and the cracker doesn’t. It bends. There are similar issues with canapés. Truffled arancini are delightful, comforting spheres of waft and soothe and loveliness. Then there’s the “crispy, salt and vinegar lamb skin”. Again, I love the idea. Why should pork get all the scratching action? Lamb fat can get in on the act, too. But it has to be served damn hot and damn crisp. This isn’t. You can taste the overly long wait it had on the pass. It was great, but perhaps 10 minutes ago. Eventually, 45 minutes after our arrival, we get to the starters. A platter of Yorkshire rabbit and carrots is Carr’s cooking at its prettiest and best. It’s whimsical, but also unembarrassed about huge flavours. There is shredded confited leg between discs of purple carrot. There’s a teeny-weeny rabbit rack, a cylinder of loin, dollops of acidulated carrot purée and what is announced as a “KFC lamb sweetbread” which does indeed come in the crispiest of coatings. It’s a plate of food you can explore. In another starter, fat scallops from Orkney are joined by a wedge of charred and buttery pumpkin, crunchy pieces of boned chicken wing and a transparent glass-like crisp flavoured with sriracha sauce. It is a bold and dramatic dish and would be thrilling, were it not for the extra 45 seconds the scallops have spent in the hot pan. There is a similar problem with a turbot dish. Admirably, the fish has been cooked on the bone. Unfortunately, it’s also just overcooked which is a crying shame for such a fine piece of fish. But again, there are elements on this plate to wallow in: a cep purée with the lightest dice of tomato, and sweet salty clams alongside braised cabbage leaves. Perched on top of those leaves are bright yellow balls of saffron potato. They are completely undercooked. They slide away from my fork. More consistent is a piece of crisp-skinned roasted guinea fowl, with fronds of roasted mushroom, a paunchy truffled potato terrine and pieces of charred sweetcorn, over which is poured a meaty, creamy old-school sauce, the good kind of brown. It could have done without the granola. I understand the desire to provide texture, but sweetened breakfast cereal is not the way to go. I do however acknowledge that a dislike of granola on savoury dishes is a long-held prejudice of mine. Others might approve. They’d be wrong, but they might. Desserts feel like initial sketches, in need of further thought. In the case of something called “Fallen Autumnal Leaves”, modelled on the forest floor, the main thought should be that it’s a terrible idea. Jerusalem artichoke sponge cake is a promise, completely broken. Tuber does not bellow dessert at me. Caramelised and salted pieces of artichoke don’t improve things. A plate of British cherries with fragments of frangipane and candyfloss is much better, though a thin disc of crumbly, cherry jelly wouldn’t be missed if it was mislaid. To get warm we order coffee. We begin one of those cheery “we’re all in it together” conversations about the chill, with the other tables. I tell them I have heater envy, one of Freud’s lesser known diagnoses. Finally, the otherwise efficient waiters acknowledge there might be a temperature issue. Mostly, there is the feeling here of an ambitious restaurant which could be great, but which right now isn’t quite sure how to become so. I do hope they work it out. News bites The tiny Restaurant No 5, in Winchcombe – like 92, named for its street address – has come a long way since I purred over it at opening in 2004. It has awards, many and various. Go there for a casserole of mussels in cider, followed by rack and belly of pork with sage, onion and grilled fig. Finish with ‘Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate’, so good they named it thrice (5north streetrestaurant.co.uk). Nottingham Trent University and the School of Artisan Food in nearby Welbeck have joined forces to offer Britain’s first degree in artisan food production, with teaching across both institutions. Year one includes modules on bread, patisserie, dairy production and both food chemistry and entrepreneurship and marketing. The first intake is September 2019 (ntu.ac.uk). Exhausted by the prospect of cooking Christmas lunch? You’re not alone. A survey of 20,000 AA members shows that the number of people set to eat in a restaurant or pub on Christmas day has trebled from 3% to 10%. In London and the southeast that figure rises to 25%.

Dishes £5-£17. Desserts £10. Wines from £35 Great restaurants are rarely born. They are made. They are the accretion of details done right over time. They have to find their feet, and their hands and all the other bits of their metaphorical anatomy. Cornerstone, in east London’s Hackney Wick, does not feel like it went through any of this. It seems to have arrived in the world fully formed, which is all the more remarkable given the weight of expectation upon its shoulders. Until very recently Tom Brown was the new best chef you had never heard of. I first clocked his name in the summer of 2017 when Nathan Outlaw put him forward for the OFM young chef of the year award. As well he might: Brown was his head chef at the Capital Hotel in London’s Knightsbridge, after a training which had taken him through some very serious kitchens at very great speed. He didn’t win that year, but it was clear from what Outlaw said that he would soon have his own restaurant and that it would be worth our time and our appetite. So it has proved. A few weeks ago, Brown finally helped win an OFM award, when Cornerstone was named Newcomer in Food and Drink, a category voted on by our expert panel. I wasn’t there for the final judging. I had a braised otter dish to road test, or some festering, overpriced gastro-cataclysm to eviscerate. Something like that. In any case, I’d have had to place my vote elsewhere simply because I hadn’t been there. Now I have been and it’s all very simple: blimey, Cornerstone is good. Fish cookery is tricky. There are hordes of people who worship at the altar of the raw ingredients; who argue that the less you do to them the better. They have a point. Seafood is delicate; best leave well alone and all that. Then again, if you know what you’re doing, how much better is it to take the good stuff and make it shine through wit, technique and good taste? Take the “pickled” oyster. The inverted commas are mine, for while there is a lot of brisk acidity here, it is not so much pickled as dressed. That’s dressed as in haute couture. It is impeccably tailored. Yes, there is a bright, fresh and crisp, cooling herby liquor. But there is also a horseradish cream and the tiniest dice of celery, and finally a frond or two of dill. There is an astonishing amount going on inside such a small half shell. But the truly astonishing thing is that it does not overwhelm the oyster, which still speaks for itself. Give one of those a go and you know you are in safe hands. So it continues. Raw gurnard is sliced thinly, laid out across a plate and dressed with sherry vinegar and the crunch of almonds and a little cream. It’s one of those dishes which is all about judgment. How much is enough and how much is too much? Brown understands the word “enough”. These two dishes make it all sound like a delicate pinkie-raised affair, but it really isn’t. A big fat homemade crumpet, sitting proud on the plate, comes stacked with a generous pile of nutty potted shrimps, dripping with spiced molten butter. There is a dice of gherkins to help you pretend this isn’t a total heart-stopper and, on the top, a tangle of kohlrabi in ribbons. It’s the thinking person’s crumpet. It’s what high tea would look like if it was served in a bordello. A little closer to the nursery is a ripe, foamy pillow of cod brandade, speckled with fresh green herbs. It is piled with wild mushrooms sautéed in butter. In the middle, sitting pert and golden, just waiting to run, is an egg yolk, its surface dusted with salt and pepper. It is a dish so handsome it almost feels like vandalism to slip in the knife. But only almost: the yolk runs, the mushrooms meet the brandade and all is right in the world. What underpins the cooking is a clear understanding of the essentials. A pristine piece of hake, all pearly flesh and golden skin and utter delight, is perfectly cooked. A beautiful fish has been shown respect. In the circumstances the lightly spiced pumpkin purée and the thyme dressing feel like the gorgeous velvet box in which a diamond ring is presented. And now I’ve gone off on one, which is what happens when the food is this good. Not that all the ingredients need to be such huge marquee names. A lowly wedge of celeriac is chargrilled and partnered with silky cod’s roe and hazelnuts. At the end we are presented with a skate wing, cooked to the point when it practically removes itself from the cartilage. It comes with a deeply savoury and luscious roast chicken butter sauce. Whisper those words to yourself: Roast. Chicken. Butter. Sauce. If you’re not sighing happily, then you are dead inside. Brown recently appeared on Great British Menu, where his fish cookery made an impact. On his first outing in 2017 it was his desserts which got the attention and, having tried two of those here, I understand why. A mille feuille of pear with whorls of cream flavoured with Earl Grey tea, sandwiched between delicate circular tuile, is a seriously classy piece of work. It is bettered only by a blackberry and quince pavlova, starring a bulging meringue which manages the crunchy-chewy thing. Is Cornerstone without blemish? Not entirely. Infuriatingly, the wine list has nothing below £35 a bottle which, frankly, is crass, the more so given this is Hackney Wick. The area may be undergoing major redevelopment. The building it occupies is a part of that. But this is still an economically mixed part of town. There are some who feel a restaurant of this ambition is completely out of place. I would argue it fits a mixed economy and that the food pricing is fair. The wine pricing is not (although I am told they are rethinking it). Then there is the space. With its polished concrete flooring, industrial ceiling ducting and gunmetal-grey bar fringing an open kitchen, it can be bright and spacious on a sunny day. By night it could lean towards the hard-edged. Then again, what matters here is the cooking. In truth you should mostly be looking at your plate. If you’re staring round the room, you have completely missed the point. Jay’s news bites Riley’s Fish Shack, housed in a shipping container on the beach in Tynemouth, is a favourite of mine but has never had a mention in News Bites, so it’s time. The dedication to fish cookery matches that at Cornerstone, but the aesthetic is more rugged: mackerel wraps, lobsters, chargrilled squid, served in cardboard boxes. It’s open through the winter, storms allowing (rileysfishshack.com). And a big hello to new mail order subscription service Books + Beer, which does what its name suggests. For £10 (plus P&amp;P) they will send you a box containing a paperback in a genre of your choice, plus two craft beers. 50p per box will go to the male mental health charity Calm (booksplusbeer.com).

It sells cakes and tea and hearty lunches. It sells Cornish steak pasties, clotted cream ice-cream and fragments of bygone, possibly misremembered British summers. An era where, for a lot of us, abroad seemed very far away, and a summer holiday meant one week in a static caravan in Filey and sleeping on a pull-out hammock dangling over a chip pan. For me, the Hidden Hut reminds me of Dent days out circa 1983, driving in an Austin Maxi to a beachside tea hut in Kirkcudbrightshire with my grandmother and her Jimmy Shand and His Band cassette. A 200-mile round trip in order to eat pork luncheon meat and Stork on Mother’s Pride medium-sliced. It was a time when SPF was only for the precious and sun-stroke a small badge of honour. Everyone will get a different Proustian bombardment from a visit to the Hidden Hut, which is lovely, although it is memories like this that helped win Brexit. This much-loved Cornish dining spot, I must underline, would never stoop to serving luncheon meat sandwiches, melted Wagon Wheels, teeth-staining blue Slush Puppies or any other crap things from bygone high days. No, this is British summer filtered through a Jamie and Jimmy’s Friday Night Big Lads’ Beezer-type lens. The food is recognisable and reassuring, but with dashes of pizazz and minor weirdness for the tourists and trendies. On the day I stopped by, there was a chipotle beef chilli – all good so far – but with added feta and served with herb-speckled bulgur wheat. This culinary brouhaha flies in Stoke Newington, but in Porthcurnick it is positively raffish, and I love them for it. The smoked haddock and mussel chowder was served with local samphire and oven-fresh focaccia. It could have done with being warmer, but I was eating it outdoors in a gale. The soup of the day was watercress and gorgonzola, which sounds like something Roald Dahl would have The Twits choose. Fresh from the Hidden Hut’s in-house oven there was a brioche bread pudding, a salted-caramel flapjack, a gluten-free orange and lemon slice, plus – my choice – a very, very good, moist vegan banana bread. The Hidden Hut’s gluten- and dairy-free stuff is acquired from a specialist kitchen called, wonderfully, The Exploding Bakery, but this is largely a family team who stand smiling at the window of a kiosk and serve things they are pulling more or less straight from their hearts. It is impossible not to adore the place. There’s a reason the Hidden Hut’s much-talked-about “feast nights” – where locals bring their own plates, cutlery and booze to settle in for a night of dining and joy – sell out in mere minutes. “Dress for the weather! We go ahead whatever the forecast says,” the website warns, which I find joyful. Because what is Britain without people stoicly eating mackerel in sideways drizzle? Yet on an everyday Hidden Hut lunchtime, one can grab a carton of very lightly fragranced lentil and cauliflower dal, a slab of salted caramel shortbread and a bottle of Luscombe Organic’s Sicilian lemonade and head to the sharing tables overlooking the dreamy, uncluttered cove. Or one can retreat down to the beach, or even gravitate farther up the hill and perch on the grass. I lunched with many, many sixtysomething couples on touring or walking holidays. They were those types who, after many, many years of partnership, would much rather eat silently, and some were communicating only via their dogs, which seems to me a perfect set-up. “Hercules likes it here!” one woman said on behalf of a rotund golden retriever. “Hercules would like us to stay for another tea!” I adore this type of day out now, sweating slightly in a foldaway cagoule and Caudalie Soin Solaire SPF 50 while perusing a National Trust brochure. Back in the 1980s, however, I would have been tantrumming at my mother for the car keys so I could go and listen to Dave Lee Travis. I wish I could have my grandmother back for just one day to take her to the Hidden Hut. We would listen to the Bluebell Polka on the way and, most of all, I’d enjoy her unbridled spite over the concept of gluten-free vegan banana loaf. The past is another country. They eat cakes differently there. • The Hidden Hut Porthcurnick Beach, near Portscatho and St Mawes, Cornwall; no phone.

Breakfast dishes £1.50-£8.50, starters £3-£8, mains £10-£14, all wine £20 I travel this country so much, some of my friends call me the train whisperer. They claim I have electrified rails for bones. I know the differences between the unreserved carriages on the East Coast and West Coast lines. I know where best to stand on random station platforms – York, Cardiff – to have the best chance of getting a table seat, and what time past the hour the trains depart from Manchester for London. When my work on The One Show took me to Wales regularly, the guards at Paddington would allow me through the gates early because we were on first-name terms. I’m a trainspotter with benefits, the benefits being that I actually get on the trains. To be honest, these past three months when I have been completely off the rails have been a blessed relief. For one, it has spared me the eccentricities of the great British travelling public: the woman sitting opposite me one morning who, as we chuffed past Slough en route to Bristol, took out wet wipes and swabbed her armpits; the man who started watching the football on his iPad without headphones on the way back from Newcastle and when challenged on the noise pointed out indignantly that it wasn’t a quiet carriage; the myriad dog owners who think their animals are so damn lovable that I should feel privileged that they choose to wander unhindered down the carriage and stick their noses in my crotch while I’m trying to work. This is my way of acknowledging that my reviews have been London-centric for the past three months. I like to think of myself as the critic who reaches the parts other critics don’t reach – Oban, Llandudno, Woking – but sometimes circumstances do not allow. In a couple of weeks, I will once more be the wandering (non-observant) Jew. As Steve Coogan’s character in The Trip – the character called Steve Coogan, who was standing in for the Observer’s regular restaurant critic, ie me – once pointed out, I will once again be the man who travels hours to sit in front of a bowl of orange soup. That said, being able to get deeper under the skin of the hungry city I call home has been fun. You don’t just have to go to Sowerby Bridge to be intrepid. Take this week, for example: I went to Deptford. Yes, really. I’ve lived in south London for 30 years this month, and yet to me this is the undiscovered country. It turns out all you have to do is head towards New Cross and turn left. Here, in an undulating park built on the site of a massive second world war bombing that was meant for Rotherhithe just a mile to the north, you’ll find a former 1970s public toilet block, built from bricks the colour of dried mud. It is that thing all cities should be good at: a brownfield site turned into a delightful place for lunch. What’s more, it’s on all the marked cycle routes from New Cross to the banks of the Thames. For this, all credit should go to Martin Hoenle, from southern Germany. He’s a veteran of the hotel business who has lived in London for years and spotted that the disused building had been given an A3 licence. Weirdly, Lewisham Council were reluctant to let Martin follow through with his plans; they muttered about noise in a residential area. It’s bizarre, because Festa sul Prato – which roughly means party on the lawn or in the park – is the kind of use for abandoned buildings that any community should want. It’s whitewashed and airy inside with a large open kitchen, a bar stacked with whole cakes, a high-pressure coffee machine knocking out killer espressos, and, on the back wall, a blackboard drawn up with enough options to get you from first thing to last. This being London 2018, they will, of course, crush avocado on to toast for you in the morning. They will knock up a huge full English, with pork products of impeccable provenance – all their suppliers have their photographs on the walls – for £8.50. Lunch is through the week with dinner on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. All wines are £20 a bottle. Occasionally they house supper clubs here, and so on. The temptation with a place so utterly cheery and fun and good-hearted is to rave and dribble, in a way which raises the food on to some culinary pedestal. Festa sul Prato does not need to be worshipped in that way, because it offers that thing we all crave: the good, the solid and reliable, at a fair price. For Sunday lunch we start with a plate of their antipasti, piled with pink folds of Parma ham and peppercorn salami, pieces of marinated artichoke heart, olives, and handfuls of rocket. A cheese plate brings scoops of runny gorgonzola, lumps of mild toma and pearly leaves of mozzarella. There’s a big plate of oil-dribbled, still-warm toast. That makes the cherry tomato toast we order slightly redundant, except it’s lovely, the tomatoes roasted to a sweet squidge. There’s a meat and a non-meat pasta dish each day at £6 or £10. A tenner gets you enough to take some home in a box. Our penne with a long-simmered sauce of ground-down Italian sausages is the star. All other mains come with the same sides: crisp, nutty rosemary-roasted new potatoes, a handful of properly sautéed mushrooms that are golden and brown in all the right places, a bit of salad. Roasted beetroots of many colours are vegetables taken seriously. A steak tagliata doesn’t quite match its description. The dish requires the steak to be sliced up – tagliata means to cut – but here it’s served as one flat, minute steak. Still, it’s well cooked and pelted generously with cracked pepper, which always makes me happy. We have a hefty slice of lemon drizzle cake from the local Blackbird Bakery, because the job demands it, not because we are hungry. When I first heard about Festa sul Prato, via email, it was described to me as an exemplar of “how to navigate the choppy gentrification-by-food water with grace and aplomb”, and I think that’s right. Good parks should come complete with cafés priced within reach for as many as possible, which is what this is. It also happens to be a hell of a lot more. News bites Buon Apps in Otley, West Yorkshire, serves a similar purpose to Festa Sul Prato. It’s a sturdy, reliable Italian, which can both feed those looking to linger and those needing a quick lunch. Plus, being by a river, there’s a pleasing outdoor area. Nothing about the menu – pasta, pizzas, some big-fisted mains – will prove hugely surprising, but they do it all very well (buonappsotley.co.uk). Wolseley owners Corbin &amp; King have launched an initiative to increase the number of people aged over 50 employed by their expanding group of restaurants. ‘Around 30% of the UK workforce is now aged 50 or over, yet this is not reflected in hotels and catering,’ says co-founder Jeremy King, describing it as a ‘missed opportunity’. Currently just 65 of their 900 employees are over 50. More details have emerged about ex-Noma chef Simon Martin’s forthcoming restaurant Mana, in Manchester’s Ancoats. He’s planning to serve a 16-course tasting menu in 1 hour and 45 minutes. That’s one course every six and half minutes. Gulp.

A la carte £45 for three courses. Tasting menu £75. Wines from £23 Do you have a birthday coming up that needs celebrating? No? How about a wedding anniversary? Or your parents’ wedding anniversary? Doesn’t matter if they’re dead. An anniversary is an anniversary. It needs marking. You don’t have one of those? Perhaps a pet’s birthday? Or, I dunno, it’s happy Thursday. Just find something worth celebrating, even if it’s merely the gruelling business of being alive, and use it as the excuse to go and eat at Röski in Liverpool. You’ll thank me. More to the point, you’ll thank chef Anton Piotrowski. I first came across him when he competed on MasterChef: The Professionals in 2012. The dessert he served us was listed as a carrot cake with chocolate soil. We read the description to each other and rolled our eyes: chocolate soil? Oh pur-leaze. This is because we are appalling people who shouldn’t be allowed on television. When it turned up, served in a plant pot, we huffed some more because, really, what’s wrong with bowls and stop trying so bloody hard. Except it was a total joy: yes, whimsical, but also cleverly thought out and executed. Which proves you can do anything you like as long as you’re smart enough. I was not surprised when Piotrowski was named (joint) winner that year. He’s been on what reality TV shows refer to as a journey since then, literally so, from a pub in rural Devon where he was fully garlanded, through Plymouth to this spot amid the redbrick splendour of Liverpool’s Rodney Street. Röski is a combination of his name and that of Rose, his other half, plus an umlaut because who doesn’t love one of those. Care has been taken with the room: there are the deepening shades of grey on the striped banquettes, the wild flower arrangements from dining room to the loo downstairs, the spindly lighting and the covetable Japanese ceramics. As ever, though, what matters is what those gorgeous bowls contain. It is has become fashionable to sneer at the complex, and I am more than susceptible to fashion. We venerate simplicity, with good reason. Simple is terrific. If you’ve got great ingredients, offer them up to the best of their own advantage by not doing very much at all. That’s a lovely thing. But there is a place for complicated, if you know what you’re doing. In this case it starts deceptively simply, with a plate of open-crumbed sourdough from Baltic Bakehouse, with two butters. One is smoked. The other is pre-mixed Marmite butter. And now I am a little in love for here is a flavour of childhood, plonked down right in the heart of the adult experience. There are two menus, a full-on tasting job of a dozen or so small courses for £75 with gnomic titles such as “This little piggy went to Röski” or “Cajun goat”, or a short changing à la carte for £45, with a few bells and whistles. We go for the latter and start with a bell that rings pure and true: two discs of raw cod that have been marinated in a cool broth of green tea and ponzu. Plankton may have been mentioned, too. It’s then dotted with a wasabi mayo and fennel jam. It’s fresh and bright with a measured acidity, with the light waft of aniseed across the subtle fishiness of the best sashimi. Another small dish brings an impeccable langoustine, sautéed, under a drift of bread crumbs fried in wagyu beef fat, with splodges of garlic mayo. It’s no more than two mouthfuls, but you will recall both of them because they are pure gastronomic smut. A starter of a meatless red cabbage “bolognese” really doesn’t need the inverted commas, for here are all the flavours of your classic spag bol. And yet it’s as if they’ve been to a Swiss finishing school to learn a bit of refinement. The red cabbage has been diced to within an inch of its life and cooked down in a dizzily intense tomato sauce. There is a dollop of parmesan custard, another of tomato sauce, and a third of a green herb purée. And lo: it is also a tricolore. From the meatier side there’s a piece of boned-out guinea fowl with thick, crisp skin, a deep jus, slices of truffle, courgette and a courgette purée. I decide it’s now the Spinal Tap of restaurants with every flavour turned up to a welcome 11. It continues with the main courses. There are two pieces of aged sirloin, laid with a couple more rosy langoustines. There are seared leeks and a garlic jus, and on the side a pot of buttery smoked mash, which is so luscious I’m minded to use it on my cheeks as an anti-ageing cream. This is serious, bourgeois cooking, with no interest in the restrained. The kitchen wants you to know you’ve been fed. Likewise with the fish dish, which changes depending on what’s best available. Today it is sensitively cooked lemon sole which, like me, is both meaty but, at the same time, strangely delicate. Brown shrimps are heaped on top under one of those intense rust-coloured fish sauces, that speaks of roasted shell and claw and a lost night on the Marseilles docks. Alongside is a light, fluffy and crisp salt cod croquette. We finish with the same carrot cake in a plant pot with which he first made an impact. It’s smaller now, but just as compelling. There is the layer of cream cheese above the carrot and walnut sponge, and a serious hit of citrus popping candy. On the side is an eye-widening carrot and orange sorbet which picks up fragments of crumbed chocolate. Stuck in the middle is yer actual baby carrot. And all this is plated on half a tree trunk, but he can be forgiven because the plating isn’t there to make up for failings in the dish. Service, by one bright-eyed bearded chap, is effortlessly cool and charming. The nearest to a criticism is the bought-in mediocre chocolates offered as petit fours from a slightly dusty box. They should just make one perfect truffle themselves and leave it at that. Piotrowski and Röski have been through a few struggles to get to this point: a failed crowdfunder, an aborted and overly complicated pre-payment system. But it has now settled down, found its way and is singing. All I can say is: lucky Liverpool. News bites Not far away at Heswall on the Wirral is Burnt Truffle, the second restaurant from chef Gary Usher. It serves inspired bistro food in simple surroundings: think braised featherblade of beef with butternut squash purée, lemon sole with beurre noisette and a choux bun with salted caramel sauce to finish. His more recent restaurant Wreckfish is in Liverpool, but I’ve yet to eat there (burnttruffle.net). Honest Burgers, which became the first restaurant in Europe to serve the vegan Beyond Meat Plant burger, when it was put on the menu at its King’s Cross branch in July 2018, is to roll it out to all 29 of its outlets in London, Cambridge, Reading and Bristol. It will cost £11.50, including a side of its slightly addictive rosemary salted chips (honestburgers.co.uk). Urmston in Greater Manchester is to get what it’s claiming to be the UK’s first privately owned food market hall. Market 41, which will open in 2019, is expected to house around a dozen operators, focusing on independents and small restaurants, and will have space for 180 covers.

All dishes £6.50-£11.95. Wines from £16 Twenty-five years ago, when my time was cheap and work scarce, I spent three days as a reporter in the old Bull Ring Market in Birmingham. The built, scuffed, graffiti-strewn, urine-splashed environment was due for demolition to make way for the glossy city centre that now occupies the space. Few were prepared to mourn the grey concrete sprawl, with its shadowed underpasses, but it housed a unique retail culture that deserved to be recorded before it went. I was sent to do the recording. There were the lines of flower stalls run by ladies of a certain age. They were sisters but traded independently of each other, because of a decades-old row that they could not quite bring themselves to explain. There was the fruit trader with sparkling blues eyes and skin the colour of conker who told me the unusual combination was on account of his “pure Romany blood”. It seemed fair to take his word for it. There were the butchers, and the stands selling overstuffed roast pork sandwiches, and the barber with the switchblade who gave me a shave so close it felt like puberty had been reversed. Sentimentality for its own sake is foolish. There were, of course, dodgy goods being sold down there, and food items so beyond their safe date you wouldn’t foist them on an unloved pet. Buyer beware and so on. For all that obvious stuff, my love for a classic market remains undiminished. As a student in Leeds, I was sustained by the cheap deals offered within the Victorian glories of the Kirkgate Market and rewarded myself with baps full of thick cut, dry-cured bacon cooked on a black hot-plate in its own grease. For me a real market is one that sells both bacon baps and big knickers. Walking through Doncaster’s market, even on a quiet day when most of the big-knicker stands are shuttered, brings a sweet reminder of their joys; the sense that around the next corner might well be something you didn’t know you absolutely needed. In the section of the covered market dedicated to fish, that something is Clam &amp; Cork, a small seafood café doing lovely things with the catch that arrives here daily, mostly from Grimsby a few miles due east. It occupies a former wet fish stand, tucked in among many others. A stainless-steel counter has been attached to the entire rim. Pull up a bar stool. Have just a couple of shucked oysters if you like, or perhaps a little more. The sloping displays which once will have been filled with fish on ice, are now filled with bottles of prosecco on ice, alongside sturdy white wines at £16 a bottle. There is a short menu of small and big plates, supplemented by daily specials. It belongs to local chef and businessman Michael Price, who also runs a supper club in the city. With a venture like this, location is everything. If a wet fish stand in one of Brixton’s covered markets turned from selling seafood full time to cooking it, the least you’d get is a bit of championship standard eye-rolling. It would probably turn into a shouty row about the bloody middle classes coming in here with their hoity-toity bouillabaisse recipes. The moaning would be interminable. It would be justified, but interminable. In Doncaster, it’s still a kind of gentrification, but it has to be welcome – even if its fondest cheerleaders will vouch that Donnie is hardly overrun with great eating options, especially ones offering this level of value. We are won over straightaway by a plate of five fat crab claws in the lightest of lacy tempura batters, pockmarked with pieces of fresh red and green chilli. There’s a garlic and lime mayo to dredge them through and the instruction to hold the tip of the claw with a napkin because the shell will still be hot from the bubbling oil. It’s a lot of fresh crab for £9.50. About a quid more gets you a platter of fat scallops, fiercely seared on one side, with cubes of crisped pork belly, slivers of extra crackling, apple sauce and a few green leaves. I’ve seen plates like this served up in many a fancy restaurant of the sort where teenage waiters are employed solely to lead you to the toilets because, with your ability to spend stupid money on dinner, comes the assumption that you are also helpless. But it’s always been at double the price or more – and the kitchen had walls rather than being open to the elements. A south Indian fish curry, full of fillets of meaty white fish treated with tenderness and care, comes in a sweet and deep caramel-coloured sauce of the sort that makes me fear for my shirt. It is heavy with roasted spices and attention to detail. Even the timbale of rice in the middle of the plate is a beauty. Some kitchens just can’t do rice. It comes out in a soggy clag. This is a delightful dome that breaks apart into fluffy grains at the tap of a fork. That is what somewhere like Clam &amp; Cork does to you. It is so good-natured, such a joyous, simple find, that you end up sighing over well-cooked rice. To check out the basics, we get a crispy fish burger and chips. The fillet is properly crispy, the batter setting in all the tight crevices, and the chips are exemplary. The toddler to my right, out of his pushchair, is very happy indeed. As he should be. The best I can do for a gripe is, the squid rings hadn’t been entirely freed of membrane before being deep-fried in their salt and pepper batter. But that’s just me trying to look all butch and critic-like. There are no desserts yet, but they say they’re thinking about it. The service is cheery, when it makes sense for it to happen; most of the time dishes just get handed straight out of the kitchen to the diner by the nearest chef. Otherwise our Slovakian waitress, who tells us she’s here in Doncaster “because life happened”, does the heavy lifting. Right now, it is open only until 4pm, unless the horses are running over at Doncaster Races and then it closes at 8pm. But don’t spend your money on the gee-gees. Spend it on lunch at the Clam &amp; Cork. You’ll thank both me, and them. News bites Much closer to (my) home inside the covered market known as Brixton Village is Beijing street food café Mamalan. They offer a menu of dumpling and noodle dishes. I’ve become utterly addicted to their crispy chicken wings with chili oil. London is overrun with wing options – the Sichuan wings at Chik’n on Baker Street also deserve an honourable mention – but these are the best (mamalan.co.uk). Investor Luke Johnson, who recently had to put together a personal £20m package of loans to rescue Patisserie Valerie from closure, is facing another challenge. The sale of the 40-strong Gail’s Bakery group, which Johnson is also a major investor in, has been delayed, probably until after Brexit. Another sign of just how competitive the market for good cooks has become: Paul Kitching’s Edinburgh restaurant 21212 has moved to a four-day working week. The brigade will stay on the same wages, but he hopes the change will ‘fuel their creative flair’, in a move which will doubtless improve work life balance (21212restaurant.co.uk).

But life’s flotsam prevented me. Also, if I’m honest, it’s trickier to find someone to accompany you on an experimental tasting odyssey in south Birmingham. San Sebastián? Now that’s easy. Modena? They’ll be queuing up. Goal hangers, the lot of them. Moseley, on the other hand, about three miles south of the Bullring, is a harder sell, which is shortsighted, because Brum is a lot of fun. There’s a lot of joy to be found at Digbeth Dining Club, the city centre’s weekly street-food shindig, and of course in a balti on Ladypool Road. And if fancy is what you’re after, the star men at Michelin love the West Midlands. They certainly seem impressed by chef Brad Carter, the young, bearded, intense-looking proprietor of Carters, who puts me in mind of someone you’ve seen in a sepia photo of Victorian strongmen. There’s a large dose of maverick in this rather unassuming single-room joint, between a pharmacy and a firm of solicitors in a mock Tudor parade of shops in Moseley. It does not feel a typical place to tout tasting menus of girolles with cereal, shimmering kohlrabi slices with tiny pine leaves or his signature Porthilly oysters cooked in beef fat. Carter and his team will take a small, luscious handful of ripe, Evesham tomatoes, skin them, then puddle them with smoked curd and a suggestion of basil. Or whip up an earthy porridge of pine mushrooms and grate Manjimup truffle on top. But despite the odds – and many, many chefs have crashed and burned offering tasting menus to a suburban clientele – Carters has been a huge success. Perhaps this is because Carter conducts the sort of tasting menus that restore your faith in fine dining, should you have been burned in the past by 12 courses of titivated fresh air and a begrudging Burger King drive-thru en route home. Carter, on the other hand, means for you to be sated, over 13 or so incremental steps – involving sourdough, cultured butter, cream, barley, Cornish lamb figs, Orkney scallop and so on. Joyously, they can do the whole thing vegetarian – backwards in heels, if you will – without so much as turning a hair, and I love them for this. So while Charles ate lamb topped with a vivid green mess of English peas and shredded sea lettuce, I was brought an entire, prettily roasted tiny cauliflower, browned on all sides, served with a tiny pan of buttery, elderflowery, lemony hollandaise. Too often when Michelin-star places ditch meat, one is left with several courses of petals floating in a spring garden consommé. Perhaps as a nod towards this, one course for the vegetarians is cress in a pot like a bonsai tree, with a pair of ornate clippers delivered to the table so you can, well, trim your own bush. There’s a nub of Maida Vale soft, washed-rind Guernsey milk cheese on maltloaf. Later, Lichfield raspberries on fermented rice, creating a Michelin-starred Müller rice. Carter’s menu is a meaningful dance involving sharp umami thrusts and creamy, fruity bursts. And it’s all peculiarly down to earth. Service is drilled and absurdly knowledgeable, but also warm and twinkly. On a Friday night, the room is a jolly, chatty, upbeat place with, yes, some serious gourmands snapping pics and ruminating over fermentation technique, but just as many Moseley locals picking their way through the biodynamic wine list. I drank a glass of Grafin by Sepp Muster, which was the type of cloudy orange, funky-tasting affair that makes some wine-lovers quite apopleptic. I shan’t lie: 13 courses does go on a bit. This is always the way. During chef Gareth Ward’s 20-course tasting opus at Ynyshir Restaurant and Rooms, I left the table after 15 courses, went to my room, changed into lounge pyjamas, took my contact lenses out, listened to Black Sabbath to wake myself up and returned to the table with a second wind for the final five-course push. All restaurants should offer this option. At Carters we sat down at nine and left around midnight. As we left, diners were loitering around the pass, hoping to chat to the maestro. Carters is my favourite type of discovery. It is wonkily, weirdly, pretty much perfect. It is challenging and a tiny touch gruelling, but I’d go back for seconds.

Small plates £6-£14.50, big plates £12.50-£20.50, desserts £6-£9, wines from £30 I remember the betrayal as if it were yesterday when, in truth, it was a Thursday evening in July 1981: Top of the Pops night. I had taken up position in front of the television, the loyal sentry, ready for the most important event since, well, whatever the last one was: the new Spandau Ballet single. I had thought To Cut a Long Story Short not merely a cracking electro dance tune, but a cultural artefact of great importance. It involved tartan worn unironically, raging drums and huge declarative vocals. Listening to it made me feel serious. Musclebound was even better. Grease me up and send me out on to the Mongolian plain. I had seen the future and its name was Spandau Ballet. Now, here it was: Chant No 1 and… what the actual? What in God’s name had they done? This wasn’t a New Romantic, tartan-clad, floppy-fringed piece of post-industrial electro pop. This was, oh God, funk! I watched for about 90 seconds then turned off the telly and walked away in disgust. After all I’d done for Spandau. After all that loyalty, all that arguing with Charlie Lewis about why they were better than Teardrop Explodes, actually. In time I got over it. I learned to love the shiny pop of True. But the lesson remains: if you’ve made your name by driving down the middle of one lane, you’d better think hard before swerving out of it. Rovi, the new restaurant from Israeli-born chef Yotam Ottolenghi, is a lane swerve. It’s a subtle one, but a swerve all the same. For a start it is modish, in a way Ottolenghi has never been. Of course he’s been new before, but it’s always been his newness. It’s a mark of his brilliance that, through his delis, cookbooks and Guardian columns, he has created his own space full of charred vegetables and big-shouldered salads that somehow manage never to collapse under the weight of their myriad ingredients. He showed us how to use sumac. He was his own trend. Rovi takes hungrily from others. It’s a live fire restaurant, because this year gas rings are simply regarded as one long bored eye roll. The kitchen here ferments with gay abandon; at Rovi, Lacto Bacillus isn’t the new Lithuanian chef de partie, but a major part of the process, because Skandi flavours are in. There are Japanese references, too – dashi, tempura – which feel very un-Ottolenghi. There’s also an uncluttered simplicity to the food. Prior to this his food has always been about piles of things heaped in bowls. His was the unmade bed of cooking. This is cleaner and tidier. From the very first the food makes an argument for itself. It’s a Chinese restaurant-style prawn toast, but one that’s been completely re-engineered by someone greedy enough to get their hands dirty. Instead of toast it’s a crisp-shelled, buttery crumpet. Instead of prawns it’s roughly chopped lobster, under a crust of black and white sesame seeds. On the side is a chilli dipping sauce, which is sour and salty and hot and fresh and flecked with the bright red of a new knife cut. This is a snack in Dr Martens. Another dish from the same list brings slices of bolshie, heavily spiced duck pastrami, surrounded by hunks of pickled and fermented vegetables: candy pink radishes, ravishing carrots the colour of a sunset, the darker funk of Swiss chard stems. The one clear marker that this is an Ottolenghi venture is the vegetable-led menu. There are full-on meat dishes, but so far down menu you’ll be challenged to leave space given the lure of what precedes it. Sweetheart cabbage has been slow roasted until it has collapsed into louche, buttery petals. It is smeared with a little salted anchovy and dressed with a dashi broth (there’s a fully vegetarian version, too). Various alliums – onions, spring onions and the like – are grilled until the sugars have started singing, and dressed with seeds and crisp sage leaves. To one side there is a bright sour green “gazpacho”, held back by ramparts of whipped salty feta. But the show-stopper is the celeriac shawarma. It’s a killer idea, brilliantly executed. Who knew that if you took celeriac and gently roasted it for an age, it would turn into something deep and sticky and rich? Clearly, Ottolenghi did. It is served under drifts of crisped onions inside their own gnarly pita bread with, on the side, more fermented chilli. It’s a total eye widener. It is a late-night kebab with a PhD. Yes, the £14.50 price tag feels enthusiastic, but then look at this damn room with its polished marble, plum-coloured, club-class-lounge banquettes and back-lit panels. We’re in Fitzrovia, my loves. All that isn’t going to pay for itself. Onglet skewers are pleasing enough. Much better is the Jerusalem mixed grill: a dark, seared pile of lamb sweetbreads, chicken livers and hearts and a few other things besides. It’s the meaty innards others scorn. I’ve had other versions of this where, courtesy of a tahini dressing, it’s been heavy and dull. This is light and brisk, the whole thing helped along by more dainty piles of ferments and pickles in children’s picture book colours. This is vivid, thrilling stuff. Yes, if you go for the works you will build up a big bill. But this is cooking that stays with you. A couple of dishes will set you up very nicely. Indeed, at the end we have space for only one dessert which oddly, given Ottolenghi’s skill at pastry, is a letdown. It’s an apricot clafoutis, baked inside fig leaves. The problem is that it appears to have been pre-baked before service and then reheated, so the sweet batter is heavy and thudding. It’s a bit clumsy. I’m told you should go for the chocolate and beetroot fondant instead. One other negative. Historically, us Jews don’t drink very much which may explain why Ottolenghi has come up with a wine list designed to discourage you from doing so. Between courses you can play “hunt something affordable”. Why would anyone write a wine list without at least a few bottles below £30? It’s unnecessarily exclusive. I suppose the only alternative is to get drunk on the terrific lane swerve of a food menu. News bites Husband and wife team Itamar Srulovich and Sarit Packer worked for Ottolenghi before setting up the much-loved Honey and Co on London’s Warren Street and its larger sibling Honey and Smoke on Great Portland Street. It too has an open grill. There are grilled lamb chops with spiced plum sauce, smokey aubergine with a chilli and garlic marinade and flat bread parcels filled with spiced roast chicken (honeyandco.co.uk). Kerb, the umbrella group for street food operators, has just launched its first meatless market, in London’s Devonshire Square development, at lunchtimes from Wednesday to Friday. Traders will include the vegetarian Korean BBQ stand Hanok and vegan pizza makers Little Leaf (kerbfood.com). In more meatless news, Pret A Manger is to open its first veggie branch outside London next month, in Manchester’s Deansgate. It follows the success of the original in Soho, which opened in 2016, followed by two more in east London.

Starters and sides £4-£10, chicken £9, desserts £3-£5, wine from £20 a bottle In the summer of 1978, while my family was on holiday at an all-inclusive hotel in the Algarve, the Portuguese government fell and a day’s general strike was declared. The hotel staff walked out, leaving the family who owned the place in charge. This had no impact, apart from on the food. It improved hugely. Usually we got some weird version of Anglo-continental. There really was something on the menu called Brown Windsor soup. You looked into its depths and saw your depraved soul reflected back at you. Grapefruit came grilled with brown sugar, and meats were tortured by coagulating mushroom sauces. Not on the day of the general strike. The aged matriarch had taken over the kitchen. Waiter service was abandoned and we were invited to help ourselves from a buffet. And oh, what a buffet. There were huge bowls of sweet-salty clams that left our hands smelling of the sea. There were crisp green salads and piles of a charred sausage the deep reddy-brown of a blood clot. I had never before met this thing called chorizo, but I quickly decided we would be friends forever. Best of all was the grilled chicken with its crisp, lightly charred, fiery skin, marinated in piri piri, the sauce made from African chillies and garlic and salt and oil, and all the good stuff. I wanted every day to be general strike day, but like the coma patients in Awakenings, we soon sunk back into the dark, morbid slough of Brown Windsor and grilled grapefruit. Years later, when I moved to Brixton, I found my way to a piri piri grill house on the road to Streatham. I had driven by it for a couple of years and sniffed the heady mix of charcoal and flamed chicken fat on the air before stopping to find out whether what they were cooking tasted as good as it smelled. It did. For years, when asked what my favourite restaurant was I regularly named that place, based on how often I ate their food. I got a takeaway from there once or twice a month. I loved the knobbly promise of the charred and smoky chicken felt through its foil-paper bag, where it rested on the journey home. I knew I could get the same thing on nearby South Lambeth Road, the focus of London’s Portuguese community. But this was my place. They knew me. They knew I liked the medium piri piri sauce and a little extra flame. Eventually one owner died, the other retired, and standards fell. I tried to stay loyal, but loyalty didn’t make it taste good. It was no longer the same. I tried Nando’s. Of course I did. I have a lot of time for Nando’s. If it wasn’t for their bottomless soft drinks policy they’d be the healthiest of the high street chains, and they reach demographics others simply do not reach. I just find their chicken unreliable. Too often it’s terribly dry. Dry piri piri chicken is a sad thing, in need of mourning. Even so I was doubtful about the need for a restaurant like Casa do Frango, which apparently would bring the best of the Algarve kitchen in general and of piri piri chicken in particular to London. Do we really need another piri piri chicken joint here? Surely we’re overrun with them. The answer is, yes, we do. We need this one. It’s delightful. Casa do Frango – it means chicken house – occupies a huge, airy space hard by Borough Market (incidentally, above the new home to the also admirable Native). It is effortless shabby chic, of the sort set designers strain to create: there are brick walls, distressed here and there with scraped paint, a big, airy vault of a glass-ceilinged roof, tendrils of foliage as if nature were trying to reclaim it, and massive open windows lending it an inside-out feel. I have no idea what it will be like in winter, but on a summer’s evening it is just the thing. The menu is split between small plates to start and mains which are anything you like, as long as it’s chicken. Of the small plates the star is the gazpacho, which is what the version at the Painswick was aiming for and missed. It’s less a cold soup than a thick, rustic stew roughly blitzed and full of garlic astringency and sunshine. You will want to share it and your garlic breath with a close friend. The right kind of grilled chorizo comes with vinegary pickled peppers and a black olive mayo. Grilled prawns are substantial specimens with lots of good head-suckage potential. And then there’s the main event. On the website they say the chickens are “sourced locally” which I’m going to take literally to mean they bought them in the next-door market. A chicken actually raised in Bermondsey doesn’t bear thinking about. They are small, meaty, very flavourful and, at £9 a half, good value. There are three marinade options, though if you don’t want the piri piri I’m not sure why you’d come. It’s salty and spicy in all the right places. The chips are good, the tomato salad fresh and well dressed and for fun there’s the African rice, planted with shards of crisp chicken skin. Rice with crispy chicken skin sounds to me like a great night out. Miraculously, they even make their own nata, or custard tarts. Almost nobody in London does that. They just get them in from Madeira Patisserie. To be fair to Madeira the ones here, while great, that perfect mix of flaky caramelised pastry and deep eggy custard, are no better than theirs. From an entirely Portuguese list we drink a bright, grassy Vinho Verde which fizzes away delicately on our chilli-singed tongues. They don’t take bookings for small groups, and you may end up on a communal table, but that rather suits Casa do Frango. This is an elbows-out, face-down job, which gently wafted me back to the summer of ’78. A quick note on pricing. For years I’ve listed the full cost of a three-course meal with wine and service for two, so you’d know how much you’d have to spend on the works. But going by comments on these reviews, some people seem incapable of grasping that it’s the full whack and that it could easily cost less. Oh, how they whine. From now on, therefore, I’m giving the general span of pricing across various courses, and you can all work it out for yourselves. Let’s see how that goes. Jay’s news bites El Gato Negro, which moved from Ripponden to Manchester not long ago, gets the nod here, because it’s shortly to open Canto, a new Portuguese restaurant. The mothership is an avowedly Spanish tapas place, and a very good one: alongside the standards – Padrón peppers, chorizo in cider - there’s morcilla Scotch eggs and pork ribs glazed with Pedro Ximénez (elgatonegrotapas.com). Meanwhile, Manchester is about to welcome its expanding food and drink festival, from 27 September to 8 October. The free-to-enter festival hub on Albert Square, a focus for talks and demos, will be supplemented by events across the city including a jazz gig from some big-haired Observer food critic. But that’s sold out (foodanddrinkfestival.com). To make up the shortfall in skilled Chinese chefs in the UK a consortium led by the Chichester College Group here and the Tianjin Second School of Cuisine in China, has launched Britain’s first Chinese food diploma. The course will include online webinars and practical assessments.

Meal for two, including drinks and service: £60 I think I’m in love, in that sweaty-palmed, unhealthy way; the sort that makes you think you’re going down with the flu. The object of my desire: Ugly Delicious on Netflix, which I have binge watched until images of bronzed and shiny Peking duck, golden-carapaced fried chicken and plump, taut-skinned soupy dumplings were flashing through my tortured mind each night as I drifted off to sleep. American-Korean chef David Chang and the food writer Peter Meehan had already disrupted the cosy, hugging-and-learning school of food media with their magazine Lucky Peach. Chang has never cooked anything with love; it has always been with filthy lust. Now, across a set of themed episodes – fried chicken or pizza, tacos or fried rice or crayfish – they have done the same for television. They travel the world, with suitable guides – our own Fuchsia Dunlop makes repeated, bemused appearances – in what feels like a gloriously haphazard set of jump cuts, interrogating issues of cultural identity. Deftly, they put to death notions of authenticity in food. Chang compares the latter to a nation state run by a dictator. All that matters, they say, is whether the food tastes good. Sometimes they make grandstanding statements; Chang has always been a champion provocateur. (He once gave me a kicking over what was essentially a positive review; God knows what he’d have done if I’d hated his restaurant.) But he does it with a clear-eyed sense of self and the ridiculous. What and how we eat is such a part of who we feel we are, that inevitably it leads us to emotional outbursts. Chang is reliably emotional. If he didn’t seem to hate me, I’m sure we’d be friends. I thought a lot about Ugly Delicious as I booked in to Birmingham’s Gaijin Sushi, which appears to be getting its apology in first. Depending on who is using the word, Gaijin is either an aggressively offensive word for non-Japanese people, or a self-mocking term used by non-Japanese people to signify their otherness. Either way it applies here, because this is a sushi joint run by a tall Polish chap with a shapely beard called Michal Kubiak. Previously he cooked at Sushi Passion in the city, where he developed a following among the city’s chefs. Before that, he cooked in a Japanese restaurant in Poland. So no, he has not laboured with some ancient Japanese sushi master for decades before being allowed to even wash the rice. He has not been forced to stand outside by the bins practising his knife skills until he can turn a whole turnip into an unbroken single ribbon. He’s a Polish guy who loves Japanese food. And if any of that bothers you, because you just adore a cultural stereotype, then please go somewhere else. Gaijin Sushi is an utter delight. Is it the very best sushi in the world? No. It probably isn’t even the best sushi in the Midlands. (There’s a place on a back street in Derby called Ebi that people mutter about in hushed tones.) But it’s very solid and does its thing with grace, humour and enthusiasm. Gaijin opened in March. It’s a tiny space, on a slightly brutal shopping parade next to the A38. The room is dominated by an L-shaped blonde wood counter seating just 12. Currently they are unlicensed, but they’ll let you bring your own booze for a small corkage fee. (Note to Birmingham locals: they are also on Deliveroo. Please support. It’s not like most of the food will get cold.) Hot steamy bowls of fragrant miso soup – is that sesame oil I smell or something else? – come with pieces of salmon bobbing in their depths. There are two tempura options, salmon and prawn, though as both are panko breadcrumbed rather than battered and lacy, I’m not sure they quite qualify as tempura. But as with the arguments on authenticity, I’m really not that inclined to give a toss. They can call them new wave tempura, or Japanese fritters or Keith for all I care. Let’s just describe them as very fine deep-fried things. Discs of salmon are soft beneath their crisp overcoat as if they have steamed in just seconds (the steaming of breadcrumbed foods being the whole point of most deep frying). These are also both extremely good value. Just £8 brings you six big prawns, each longer than my middle finger and trust me, I have big hands. It’s a steal. The same applies to the nigiri sushi, which are about £4 for two pieces. Slices of sticky, grilled eel are blowtorched until the oils are just starting to run, then dribbled with a little more teriyaki sauce. There are sweet, glossy translucent prawns, and surf clams, running from a deep crimson to white, like the petals of a variegated rose. There is the deep purple of tuna, and salmon with the lines of fat ribboning it in white. (A perfect example of the pointless debate over authenticity. Up until the 1970s, Japan imported very little fish, which meant salmon was not a part of the sushi repertoire. It took an enterprising Norwegian trade delegation, looking for new markets, to change that.) We have spicy tuna rolls, with a proper late-blooming kick of heat, and seaweed-wrapped rolls of crispy prawn and eel, an endlessly pleasing call and response of soft and crunch. They’re the Baptist church of uramaki rolls. Crab rolls come topped with bright orange beads of tobiko, the roe of the flying fish, like a comedy nod to Donald Trump’s combover. The eggs burst satisfyingly beneath our teeth. There are tight prawn maki rolls and, most outrageous of all, a tempura roll, tightly filled with prawn, salmon, tuna and avocado, then lightly battered and deep fried before being sliced up. The rice in all of these is perfectly fine: very lightly vinegared, a degree or so above room temperature as it should be. We have run up a bill just shy of £90, but much more out of a sense of professional duty than appetite. I’ve always been one to take one for the team. At Gaijin you can feed yourself properly for £30 a head. One thing to be aware of: they don’t open for lunch until 2pm, which may be a way of controlling trade in such a small space or may just be because it’s their place and they can run it how the hell they like. I’d like to think it’s the latter. Jay’s news bites Andy Oliver and Mark Dobbie are British cooks who, like Michal Kubiak at Gaijin Sushi, became fascinated by a culinary tradition a long way from them, in their case that of Thailand. The resulting restaurant, Som Saa in Spitalfields, is an antidote to over-sweetened green curries. Go for a black-pepper stir fry with lamb sweetbreads and oyster sauce, soy braised pork belly, or grilled aubergine salad with egg and prawn floss (somsaa.com). This year’s National Festival of Making, held in Blackburn on 12-13 May, will reveal the results of the Reg Johnson Young Chef Schools Competition, held in memory of the vastly influential Goosnargh poultry farmer who died in 2015. Finalists have been challenged to make a dish using duck. The winning dish will be available at the festival. Great news for fans of xiao long bao, the soupy dumplings of Shanghai.

Starters £8-£16. Mains £14-£29. Desserts £4.50-£8. Wines from £23 Just after our waitress had finished taking our order at Tish I looked up and said, “Is there any question you’d like to ask me?” It sounds terribly passive-aggressive doesn’t it, this interrogation, but don’t worry. Tish is a kosher restaurant in Belsize Park, north London. The room was full of Jews and if there’s one thing my people have nailed it’s passive-aggressive. Our waitress shrugged at her notepad and said: “Meh, I don’t think so.” Then she went, “Actually… Who’s having the soup and who’s having the salt beef sandwich?” Ah, the salt beef sandwich. The question I was waiting for her to ask was, “Fat on or fat off?” You can have lean salt beef. Of course you can. But it’s a bit like unsalted chips or clean, sanitary sex. I mean, what’s the point? Back in the day when Russell Norman of the Polpo Group announced he was opening a New York-style deli called Mishkin’s, serving salt beef, I forced him to have lunch with me. I lectured him on how the waiters had to ask whether you wanted the salt beef with fat on or fat off. He took notes. When they opened his waiters asked the question. So anyway, Mishkin’s closed, and now here’s Tish, by Belsize Park Tube with one of those big outside eating areas at the front, under a plastic-walled marquee, like you get at cheap weddings. Inside the restaurant proper is brightly lit with a central bar, an open kitchen and soft furnishings. There’s a toilet area with lots of floral prints on the walls, because they’re very forgiving when there’s a risk of staining. It is filled with real Jews, not part-timers like me. There are many yarmulkes on display, and middle-aged women I may well have tried to snog when we were all 14. You only need look at this crowd, at the way they interrogate their plates and eat while talking to each other, to know they do not regard this as some fancy dinner in a restaurant. It’s evening and they have to eat, so what the hell, why not eat here instead of in their own kitchens? Saves on the washing up. Most of them know each other. There is a lot of waving across the dining room and stopping by tables. It’s delightful and also, awful. The menu is trying to be all things to all (of these) people. It’s pretending to be a normal restaurant just like the non-Jews have. So there’s seared tuna and a duck breast dish and a lamb pie with truffle mash. But, well, you need to know your market so, of course, there’s chicken soup with lokshen (noodles) and there’s schnitzel and there’s ox tongue and there’s a salt beef sandwich. Look, here it comes, with a bowl of crisps on the side as if it’s a weekend lunchtime around your great aunt’s house. Or maybe round my great aunt’s house. She was called Muriel and she liked to feed. I liked to eat. We were well matched. I miss her. I conduct a forensic examination of the sandwich. There’s much lifting and poking. Now I understand why they didn’t ask the question. Because, of course, it comes with fat on. Who would want salt beef without the fat? There’s a sliced gherkin in there and sauce, and some green stuff which my colon will thank me for. It’s a very good salt beef sandwich, which it really ought to be at £15.50. The chicken soup is also a beautiful thing. It is crystal clear but full of depth. Come here when you are on the edge of death or have a minor cold, one or the other. If you’re not kosher for God’s sake don’t come here for the steak or the dairy-free ice cream. Why do that when you can go to a restaurant where the steaks bleed and the ice cream involved a cow, like it should? I think my antipathy towards the picky-eating god of the Jews is well known. I’m fully expecting to hear soon that the Jewish Lord has discovered he’s gluten intolerant and, while we’re at it, that lactose brings him out in hives. For my main course I order the gentleman’s schnitzel. That’s a veal schnitzel with a fried egg and capers. It turns up without the egg or the capers or, as it happens, the veal. She’s brought me a chicken schnitzel. I express dismay. She says: “We’re out of veal.” I say: “You didn’t think to tell me?” She shrugs and offers to get me something else. I tell her not to. (It reminds me of the story of the Jewish wedding where the chopped chicken livers were served in the shape of a carp because they didn’t have a chicken mould. True story; I put it in a novel.) It’s actually a nice chicken schnitzel. A seabass fillet with artichokes and a vegetable casserole is a solid bit of Mediterranean cooking. There’s a red cabbage and beetroot coleslaw which could keep the dry cleaners in work for months, and chips which rustle. Dessert is a game of two halves. There’s a lokshen pudding, which is compressed, set noodles with sultanas. It is dense and claggy and possessed of its own gravitational field. So, basically, it’s perfect. A gooseberry strudel is an arrestable offence. The pastry is undercooked. The gooseberry filling is under sweetened. Haven’t my people suffered enough? The all-kosher wine list is peculiar. It has only a handful of Israeli bottles, despite the country’s wine sector having developed significantly in recent years, and most of the ones they do have aren’t mevushal (it’s hocus pocus involving boiling of wines so that non-Jews can handle them. I’m not sure why I’m telling you this. Like I care.) We drink a sauvignon blanc from France which is an awful lot better than the kiddush wines which gave me a headache when I was a kid. Some restaurant reviews are consumer journalism. They tell you whether a place is worth your money. Others, like this one, are pure observational journalism. They are a snapshot of life. Tish is a bustling, noisy restaurant, frequented by a particular community. It’s already full and will stay that way. They do a good salt beef sandwich and a good chicken soup and a fine schnitzel and a terrible strudel. But unless you actually do keep kosher all you really need to know is that it’s there. It’s one for the k’nossers. That’s Yiddish for connoisseur. News bites Any talk of salt beef sandwiches leads inexorably to thoughts of the Brass Rail inside Selfridge’s Food Hall on London’s Oxford Street. I last wrote about it to moan about a less than helpful change to the purchasing system. A few years on and they seem to have sorted the problems. The salt beef and pastrami are still as good as ever. I am also addicted to their pickles (selfridges.com). Since 2016 the community-based Orchard Project has been liberating tonnes of apples and pears from London’s private gardens and public parks which might otherwise go to waste. They are then turned into cider. Lottery funding is coming to an end, so they have launched a fund-raising drive. Visit crowdfunder.co.uk and search localfox. Online food delivery business Just Eat has announced it is to start displaying food hygiene ratings for the outlets it represents.

Meal for two, including drinks and service £25-£40 Having a long history is not the same as being good. Some things – jellied eels, say, or Norman Tebbit – have been around ages and have always been awful. And then there are things which have awfulness thrust upon them by virtue of having existed long enough for the world to have moved on without them. So it is with the curry puff from Old Chang Kee, which began life as a food item sold from a Singapore street-food cart in 1956. The cart became a restaurant, which in turn became a 100-strong chain across Asia and Australia. And now they’re in London’s Covent Garden. Obviously I had to. Apparently, they’re “iconic” and “legendary” and I do so love an iconic legend. Plus, the word “puff” makes me think fondly of both dandelion heads and smoking, which I miss dreadfully. (I was terrific at smoking back in the day.) Except, of course, they’re not puffs. They’re dense, stodgy, turmeric-yellow pasties with a filling of weird oversweetened generic chicken curry mush, which could possibly be used more successfully to grout the tiles in a dodgy-coloured bathroom. It stuck to the roof of my mouth, like my swollen tongue after a bad night’s sleep. The Singapore crab version had a crab stick down the centre. Greggs do a chicken curry bake and that contains solid pieces of chicken; so does the West Cornwall Pasty Company, and Ginsters does a spicy chicken slice. I’m not recommending the latter as a life choice, but what you get up to in the privacy of your own wretched hole of a crumb-strewn living room is up to you. I’m in no position to judge. Old Chang Kee itself recognises that their curry puff is probably an adaption of a Cornish pasty-like object brought across by British colonials to somehow suppress the locals. Now they’ve brought them back here, possibly as an act of revenge. I suspect the people who will want them most are homesick Singaporeans who crave their awfulness. All of which speaks to a wider point, the global ubiquity of the filled dough or pastry object or, to use its more encouraging name, the dumpling. From the curry puff to the empanada to the pierogi to the char siu bun, siu mai, gyoza and xiao long bao, every race and creed has found a way to use up scraps of food by shoving them inside a skin or shell of some kind. Which leads us inexorably to Ugly Dumpling, where they are yet to find an ingredient they couldn’t package. Ugly Dumpling started life as a street-food operation before moving into this corner site behind Carnaby Street, which in turn was once home to the original Pitt Cue fresh off the streets. The upstairs dining room is a tiny, rough-wood-lined space, where they cram you in so close together you can easily identify your neighbour’s brand of deodorant. Even so, best stay up here in the light; downstairs is a dungeon of a space. I can see how this whole dumpling notion worked when it was mobile. You’d wander up to the reconditioned ambulance-cum-camper van with its hatch, squint at the badly scrawled blackboard menu and mutter: “That sounds lovely, yes please.” Or you’d frown and mumble: “God, no” and shuffle over instead, to that converted Morris Minor spraying pork belly with Sriracha sauce and mashed peanuts and calling it Thai food. You had a choice. Here, you have to commit fully to the way of the dumpling. The results are profoundly mixed. On one side of the short menu are the “Street food classics” at £3 to £5 for three. The best of those we try is the satay chicken, the finely minced filling boosted by a fair dribble of forceful peanut sauce. The problem here is that much better versions of the rest – the pork belly, the aromatic duck, the prawn and chive – are available five minutes’ walk away in Chinatown. The skins will be lighter, the fillings plumper, the whole execution just so much better. The “New favourites” are much more fun. Steamed silky salmon dumplings come under a zesty coriander salsa; dumplings of wild mushrooms doused in truffle oil lie under a summer snowfall of parmesan and are an outbreak of the Italianate. The halloumi filling of another may be a touch salty, but I like the fire and sweet of the roast pepper sauce. Most pleasing is the one which really should encourage eye-rolling: the cheeseburger dumpling. There’s a bolus of beef and cheese inside, a bit of tomato ketchup outside and a flurry of tiny matchstick potatoes. It’s exceedingly silly, tastes just like a cheeseburger and shouldn’t work but does. What saves Ugly Dumpling from falling into the “What was all that about?” column is the pricing – even with a bottle of wine from the very short list you’d be hard pushed to build up a sizeable bill – and the side dishes. We loved the salad of seaweed and pickled cucumber with almond flakes and, better still, a deep dish of tempura aubergine, first cooked until so soft that the only thing keeping it together is the crisp batter shell. Dessert is equally hit and miss. The fillings in both the blueberry and strawberry dumplings are undersweetened and half-hearted. Hungary has a brilliant sweet fruit dumpling tradition from which they could have taken their lead; these tasted like they were made by someone who couldn’t be bothered to get out the cookbooks. However, a pecan pie dumpling was a perfect little thing: the golden-brown, cocoa-dusted dough baked until crisp, the blitzed syrup and pecan filling just the right side of cloying. I know you want a joke about ugly dumplings and the potential to transform into something fabulous, but I have my pride. In any case, the restaurant is obviously deeply imperfect. The thing is, restaurants exist in a context. If this was the only place to get dumplings in the capital, we’d all be in trouble. But it’s not. One night you can go to Chinatown, be treated with contempt by the waiters and be served fabulous plates of plump, gossamer-skinned dim sum. And on another night, you can come here for dinky cheeseburgers or pecan pies, refashioned as ludicrous dumplings and you could wonder endlessly at the weird overheated inventiveness of the world. News bites Chop Chop on Edinburgh’s Haymarket has a full Chinese menu, with an emphasis on northern China, but if you don’t go there for the boiled dumplings you are dead to me: the casings are silky and the fillings punchy. The full 16 dumplings are a snip at £8.85. It sounds like a lot, but you’ll be surprised how moreish they are and how easily they slip down. Must haves are the lamb and cumin and the chilli chicken (chop-chop.co.uk) Proof of the obvious: crowdfunding is a gamble. Last year Hummus Bros, which grew to six London outlets, raised £125,000 from crowdfunding for further expansion. Now the chain has gone into administration. Among the causes it has blamed a rise in the cost of imported raw materials – chick peas, olive oil – as a result of the fall in the pound due to Brexit. Meanwhile the troubled Jamie’s Italian brand, which announced a dozen UK branch closures earlier this year, is all at sea, literally. It has opened its sixth outpost aboard a Royal Caribbean cruise liner.

Meal for two, including drinks and service, £225 We were three forkfuls into what they called a Caesar salad when we started Googling “kale poisoning”. Turns out that, as with any foodstuff, you have to eat absurd amounts before you experience ill effects. That, however, doesn’t deal with the possibility of dying from boredom. The kale Caesar served by Laurent at Café Royal is vast. It didn’t matter how much we forked away; it was all still there. We peered at it. Was it actually increasing in volume? Were the fronds of chopped kale springing up the more we took away? It should also be said that the application of tiny croutons and a bit of anchovy does not a Caesar salad make. It was bitter and sour and relentless. It looked like a salad bowl designed for a ruminant with four stomachs. The other starter, described as a set savoury custard, looked like it had already been through a ruminant. I cut open the puck’s thin filo shell to reveal something akin to washed-out scrambled egg with bright pink bits of flabby prosciutto, as if someone had accidentally sliced their finger into it and decided not to say a word. It was not what I was hoping for; this sort of thing never is. The Laurent of the title is the French chef Laurent Tourondel, who made his reputation in New York by noting that if he put the word “Bistro” before his name and then just used his initials, he had “BLT”, a brilliant calling card in America. Because who doesn’t like a BLT? During the noughties he opened a series of restaurants – BLT Steak, BLT Prime, BLT Burger – which prospered and rightly so. They were exactly the kind of buzzy urban brasserie you want from New York. They elevated the basics – the steak, the burger – to a certain decadent greatness, and then accessorised them through sauces. He’s a French chef who knows how to do sauces. He did a lot of them. When people asked me for a mid-range restaurant recommendation in New York I sent them to a BLT. They always came back purring. Eventually he fell out with his business partner, apparently fearing he was turning too much into a brand. Better that, than turning into a laughing stock. The whole twisted, overworked, underthought proposition at the Café Royal is bizarre. First there’s the space. The main dining room has a back-lit bar, cold marble tables to freeze your forearms on and a mirrored ceiling so you can watch yourself spending ludicrous sums on a terrible night out. Outside the room, there’s another seating area around a first-floor gallery. It’s social Siberia, forever empty. It’s the sort of space arguing couples would slip away into for an uninterrupted row before deciding who gets custody of the cat. If you’re ever unlucky enough to be seated there, you’ll think it’s because they didn’t like the look of your shoes or they spotted that you live in Nuneaton. Wherever you end up, the weirdness of the menu will make you blink and gawp. On the far left is a list of sushi and sashimi. It reminds me of Moscow, circa 2006, when the oligarchs partied and every restaurant – Italian, French, Greek – had to have a sushi menu, because it meant class and bling. Perhaps that’s what London has become – a Poundland version of Moscow in its kleptocratic pomp. We try the “spicy and crispy” shrimp sushi, six pieces for £16. The battered shrimps, perched atop uramaki rolls of avocado and tuna, are soggy. After that what you really want is leek and potato soup. Yes, really. Imagine the brainstorming session which came up with that notion: “What we need is a menu proposition that’s part Lower East Side Manhattan Japanese canteen and part garden centre café in Weston-super-Mare.” Alternatively, there’s the pasture land of the kale Caesar or the weirdness of that split cheesy custard. Starters are all in the mid-teens. Head is mostly in hands. Most of the mains are grilled meat or fish. A 250g sirloin all the way from the American Pacific Northwest is priced at a dizzying £42. Trainspotter moment: that’s £16.80 per 100g, as against £13.33 per 100g for an equivalent USDA steak at the hardly cheap 34 Mayfair restaurant. At the Café Royal, 100g of A4 grade wagyu sirloin is £75. At 34 it’s £42.50 per 100g for the better-quality A5. If you’re going to put stupid prices on your menu, it’s always worth researching the competition. From the short list of mains comes a slow-cooked wagyu beef short rib for £42. Wagyu is prized for its fat marbling and I’ve always claimed a taste for fat. It’s where the flavour is. Rub me with dripping and call me Alice and so on. This, I could not even begin to finish. In the mouth, the strands of meat dissolved into hot, tongue-coating grease. If it was too much for me, it will be too much for you. Was anything good? Yes, because something always slips through, doesn’t it? The chips were good, as they should be for a fiver, and so was the spatchcocked poussin “diablo”. It wasn’t especially diabolical; there was no heat or spice but the skin was crisp and salty, and pleasingly sour. That tiny chicken is £26. We could have had much the same food at Nando’s, for less than half the price, and without the side order of self-disgust or the ache of endless eye-rolling. The most shameful pricing is the £14 for a square of soft meringue, with wild strawberries which are spectacularly ordinary. A milk chocolate and peanut dessert is better. They manage to deaden its pleasures by bringing with the bill chocolate caramel wafers that are spectacularly salty. It stops me looking at the damage for a moment. Laurent at Café Royal has a wine list that includes two pages of champagnes that no one in their right mind would ever order. The cheapest bottle of wine is £36. One of those and an £11 glass of rosé each and suddenly we’re looking at nearly £250. Once more I find myself scratching my head. What were they thinking? Who is this for? And what would spicy tuna followed by leek and potato soup taste like? Maybe it’s a taste sensation. Or perhaps not. I went because I have a long-term interest in the chef. I can’t for the life of me imagine why anyone else will ever go there. News bites The beautiful Art Deco sweep of the Midland Hotel on Morecambe’s seafront was lovingly restored a few years ago. It’s a grand space. Wisely, however, they’ve not overreached with the food offering. The Sun Terrace Restaurant serves a solid, reliable menu of brasserie classics: roast scallops with pea purée or Morecambe Bay shrimps with rye toast, followed by roast rump and braised belly of lamb with a marjoram sauce. Book early enough for the spectacular sunset (englishlakes.co.uk). It’s all about the chippies in Edinburgh. Roy Brett, chef of the very lovely Ondine on George IV Bridge, recently opened the Fishmarket at Newhaven, with a menu of oysters, chowder and ‘proper fish and chips’. Now the Italian restaurant group Vittoria has announced plans for a 270-cover fish and chip shop inside a former church on Edinburgh’s Victoria Street. Advance nerdery alert: 16 October sees the publication of the Noma Guide to Fermentation by René Redzepi and David Zilber. According to food science guru Harold McGee it’s a ‘superb introduction to the practicalities and pleasures of cooking with microbes’.

Meal for two, including drinks and service £70-£110 Some restaurants are the product of accident. Others feel like they are shaped in response to their environment. Brigadiers is very much the latter. A bunch of inputs has been evaluated. A checklist has been studied and completed, and then reshaped as somewhere good to eat. This is not much of a surprise, given that Brigadiers is the latest from the Sethi family’s company, JKS Restaurants, one of the slickest outfits in the business. The Sethis entered the food world through Karam, chef-proprietor of Trishna in Marylebone. Gymkhana, a more relaxed take on the Anglo-Indian repertoire, followed. It thrilled with its dish of minced kid goat curry with glossy nuggets of brain, and a bill which made the reverse snobs who think food from the Indian subcontinent should be dirt cheap howl into their crap lager. Sod them, the rest of us said, and ordered another bowl. Karam was joined in the business by his siblings and they set up their restaurant investment group. They helped launch the Taiwanese art-meets-food project Bao and later its big brother Xu. They worked with chef Nieves Barragán Mohacho on her fabulous Spanish restaurant Sabor. They are involved with the hotdog and champagne bar Bubbledogs, took Sri Lankan food mainstream at Hoppers and chucked money into the modern-English Lyle’s. If someone asked you to define London’s diverse restaurant sector, show them the JKS list. It would do the job. They are extremely professional. Brigadiers, which pulls on the Anglo-Indian sporting references of Gymkhana, is one of the first restaurants to open within the dead-eyed Bloomberg arcade in the City; even skateboarders couldn’t put this bit of gloomy built environment to good use. All the fun therefore has to be on the inside: it is a multi-chambered space of lacquered tables and red curtains. It feels like a direct response to the financial institutions surrounding it, filled with a certain kind of bloke: men, stinking of pheromones, ambition and status anxiety. Once they’ve finished pulling the lever on the global fruit machine, they’ll need a space in which to kick back. Hence, Brigadiers. Yes of course women work in all those banks, but this place feels overtly male. There are flat-screen TVs, some hidden by curtains or blinds, the better to show sports. There is a room with a pool table and, next to it, on the wall, a machine dispensing serious whiskies. In the back bar are cocktails on tap. Choose from the espresso martini or the Old Fashioned. A couple of pulls on the Old-Fashioned lever and I’d be anybody’s. Underlying all this is the clash, bash and bass drum thump of Indian food with hobnail boots on. The flavours are massive; it’s the culinary equivalent of the amplifier in Spinal Tap which goes up to 11, because who wants 10? Pork scratchings are thickly dusted in chaat masala spice and served with dollops of salty cod roe. Pieces of crisped chicken skin are layered with spiced ground masala chicken. The beer snacks include ox cheek vindaloo samosas and red chilli and lemon crisps. They want you to remember you’ve eaten here. It would be hard to forget. Chicken wings come blackened in a furious spice crust and then doused in a thick butter sauce. We have a serving between the two of us. I quickly imagine popping back alone and having two bowls to myself, hunkered down over the table so nobody will spot me. “Beef chuck bone marrow keema chilli cheese kulcha” is a fighty game of food word association in a stoneware bowl. It describes a hugely compelling mince curry with a lump of roasted bone marrow down the middle, plus cheesy bread to scoop it all up with. By this point your fingertips will be oily and you’ll smell richly of roasted spices, garlic and happiness. Against these two, a small naan, piled with a mess of wood-fired mushrooms roasted with fenugreek, feels almost delicate. It isn’t, but it feels that way. Main courses are huge and meaty. There’s a mushroom biryani and a dish of roasted aubergine but, really, it’s about things which once had a pulse. The meal becomes about dark brown things on plates, but they are very good, very intense dark brown things. Lamb ribs, that often overlooked cut which demands a firm hand, here gets one. They’re pelted with spices, before being left to loiter in a hot oven until they’ve started to fall apart, then dressed in a sauce the colour of a dark leather satchel. A similar treatment is given to goat chops. We try to pick them up by the bone, but the meat drops away into the sauce. Miraculously by this point I don’t appear to be wearing my dinner. I think it’s because I’m bent down over the table, inhaling. We have a steaming bowl of soft yellow dal to soothe the blow, and a bright green chilli chutney to punch it up again. The menu lists lots of things which would encourage me back through the door again: there’s the achari beef short-rib and the full rack of tandoori lamb chops, the wood-roasted curry leaf masala turbot and the crab seekh kebabs. If I can find five friends, they’ll even do me a wood-roasted Goan suckling pig for £70 a head, which sounds like a night out I’d enjoy very much. It also sounds like a lot of money, and of course it is, but only if you stick doggedly to the dismal canard that food representing India must always be cheap. Plus, of course, I have to refer back to that neighbourhood. A proposition like this can’t help but feel calculated, however flashily it’s done. This is a big-fisted Indian restaurant priced for those investment bankers looking for a crafty midweek meal which will repeat on them constantly between trades the next day. The pork scratchings are a fiver, the chicken wings are £8 a serving, and the goat chops, £20. I suppose you’ll just have to order three pints of their sweet-sour Tropical Cyclone Mango IPA. That will help you forget about the bill. All desserts are variants on kulfi. We share a banana and yogurt version which tastes like an Indian take on a banana split. Propelled by our sugar rush, we roll out into the hard-edged night-time city, belching a heady mix of fenugreek and garlic, cardamom, cumin and delight at the sodium-kissed sky. Jay’s news bites Amaya, in Belgravia, was an early entrant to the market for quality Indian food without too much mannered formality. The menu of small plates is lengthy but at its heart are the tandoor ovens and kebabs. Go for smoked chilli lamb chops, venison seekh kebabs, grilled duck breast with spiced toasted coconut and a range of biryanis. But beware: the bill can quickly mount (amaya.biz). Chris Staines made his name as chef at London’s Mandarin Oriental Hotel, where he won a Michelin star. He reappeared in the incongruous surroundings of what was a Best Western Hotel in Bath. Now he’s taken over the Bridge House Hotel in Beaminster, Dorset, and renamed it the Ollerod. Expect fish from the nearby coast and Asian flavours (theollerod.co.uk). Even those of us who have issues with McDonald’s have found it hard to hate their coffee ads, which skewer beautifully the pretensions of the artisanal coffee shop.

I wrote a fortnight ago about Neptune in Bloomsbury, a restaurant posited as the capital’s newest, coolest, prettiest place to be tagged on Instagram while picking at eel carpaccio. Bright, meanwhile, in London Fields, is also very cool, but a completely different subsection. Bright is chef-scene, actual “foodie” cool. It is a stripped-back, semi-industrial, chicken liver agnolotti and bull’s heart tomatoes with marjoram type of cool. It’s a place hewn by young men – Liam Kelleher, Phil Bracey and William Gleave – with the kind of hospitality pedigrees that cause earnest food bloggers to clutch their faces like rapt Victorian cherubs. I love scrutinising the murky world of London restaurant hype, because nothing is more likely to make a man called Brian from Congleton bash out: “I don’t bloody care what London people think is cool! I just want my dinner,” on his 14-inch Dell Latitude. But Brian, these things do matter. By this time next year, you’ll be knee-deep in replicants of Bright’s katsu sando – panko’d pork cutlet and shredded cabbage between slices of white bread with a dollop of hot mustard. Bright is the permanent fixture of the lauded P Franco, Hackney’s low-intervention wine bar and dining counter with a changeable chef rota that has hosted the likes of Tim Spedding (now at Coombeshead Farm) and Anna Tobias (formerly of the River Cafe). Instagram influenza cool sorts did not naturally flock to P Franco, and neither will they rush to Bright, particularly when spots like Feya opened this month just off Regent Street. Feya is a pink, frilly, très Instagrammable monstrosity of a wellness cafe where it costs £9.20 to drink a “pastel rainbow smoothie” in a room that resembles Barbara Cartland’s bloomer drawer. Bright, by contrast, has an ever-changing, single-sheet menu of painstakingly pondered-over snacks, shellfish and pasta, with a few more hearty fish and meat plates. Ideas are unfamiliar, challenging – and beautifully executed. It’s the sort of place Michelin must ruminate deeply over – future-facing, lovingly sourced and whip-smart – but still they’re serving pork cutlet between slices of what looks like Mother’s Pride, and the staff are Antipodean-chilled (hell, some are even in baseball caps and dungarees). Courgette with basil and burrata curds turns out to be a breathtaking, pond-like puddle of cold courgette soup with balm-like milky swirlings. Kermit-coloured gazpacho, if you will. Delicious, and I’m generally strictly against the concept of cold soup and have doubled down on this ever since Sid Owen from EastEnders served a gazpacho on Celebrity MasterChef that was cold plum tomatoes with chopped red onion served at the temperature of street vomit. At Bright, I found a new way of looking at things. The same went for the trenette with pesto Genovese. Pesto is the last refuge of the scoundrel, and this country’s palate has been stained by tiny supermarket jars of Satan’s snot. Bright’s pesto, however, is a sensuous body rub. The red scarlet prawns are presented so beautifully that it’s almost a pity to dismantle and eat them. Like almost all prawns ever, though, they offer little bang for your buck once all the faffing and shelling is done. Oddly, one of the most wondrous things I ate at Bright was a self-effacing pizza fritta: a tiny but mighty mass of plump, fried dough with a simple hat of fresh, sweet tomato, oregano and an abstemious smattering of mozzarella. So simple, but remarkable. Grilled Dexter beef arrives on a vivid, Bambi’s death pool of tartish preserved blackcurrant jus and horseradish. There are no carbs to accompany the larger dishes – Bright has decided you don’t need this bulk. Instead, there are Keat’s Farm salad leaves and the aforementioned showstopping bull’s heart tomatoes. Sometimes in cool East London, you will find yourself howling out for a humble potato. For dessert, I demolished a large square of crisp chocolate flecked with sea salt and coriander seeds. There is nothing about this as a pudding that is remotely normal, but Bright can get away with it, because it has the swagger, the sense that it is indeed normal, and they’re all so bloody affable. Your father might well grumble his way through the natural, low-intervention wine list, pooh-poohing orange wines like a man invited to try his own urine sample, but, overall, only a hard heart wouldn’t enjoy Bright. They made me enjoy things I thought I hated and gave me tastes I’d never imagined before. And that’s what’s really cool. • Bright 1 Westgate Street, London E8, 020-3095 9407.

Meal for two, including drinks and service: £50-£100 You will soon hear an awful lot about the Moorcock Inn. It will feature on “hot right now” lists. Your annoying friends, the ones who structure weekends away around a single dinner, will start talking frothily about mini-breaks in Halifax. Social media will fill with over-lit, porny shots of intriguing-looking food, plonked in rough-hewn tableware. And for once every single bit of this sweaty, over-heated clamour will be utterly deserved. The new incarnation of the Moorcock, high on the West Yorkshire moors at Sowerby Bridge, is by turns the most self-assured and self-possessed, poised and absurdly wistful launch in years. What in God’s name possessed them, apart from great taste, fearsome cooking skills and a “sod it, let’s do it” attitude? I first heard about it a few weeks back via a greedy friend on my personal Facebook page who lives nearby. Frankly, it was a revelation. I thought Facebook was now only good for personal data capture, the dissemination of fake news and edging us towards World War Three – not great restaurant recommendations. The pub had reopened with little fanfare, my friend said. The changing bar menu included things like trotters on toast, horseradish fritters with rose pickles, and platters of their own charcuterie. At weekends they were roasting whole pigs for Sunday lunch. What’s more, it was all as lip-smackingly, head-spinningly, “spank-me-twice-and-call-me-Alice” good as it sounds. Nobody in the neighbourhood knew anything about the people involved. There was, however, a good reason for this. Australian/British chef Alisdair Brooke-Taylor, and Aimee Turford, who runs front of house, spent years together at the highly regarded In De Wulf in Belgium. Before that, they were in Australia. They may be new to the nuanced business of running a British pub, but feeding people well is something they know all about. At first it doesn’t look promising. A white-knuckle drive up vertiginous lanes leads to a monolith of a pub built against the elements. (During the Beast from the East, no car could get within half a mile.) You enter round the back, where firewood is stacked high and a massive charcoal grill sends smoke pirouetting into the evening sky. Inside all is raw wood and beam. To one side is the restaurant space; to the other, the bar still occupied by the locals, who can’t stop themselves telling you just how bloody delighted they are that this pub has happened to them. There are two spaces and two menus: a restaurant “tasting” job of nine parts, which is cracking value at £35, and a pub menu with dishes from £3 to £7. As ever, we are committed to our labours – we sit in the bar and work our way through both. From the pub menu a venison Scotch egg is a shamelessly crisp boulder of a thing, with a runny yolk and an intense gamey overcoat. A plate of their charcuterie is a flag waver for the kitchen’s interest in aromatics. Gossamer-thin slices of pork shoulder, with a ribbon of translucent fat, are served the right side of room temperature, lifted by the grassy waft of chamomile. There are slices of pork neck with the push of juniper and strips of pancetta, the saltiness of which has been soothed by a treacle cure. Alongside are hunks of their own sourdough, with a crisp, dark crust and an equally treacly crumb to be smeared heavily with their salty cultured butter. Cream gives way to the cheesy tang of light fermentation. That bread comes in handy with the pork rillettes, spun through with smoked bone marrow. This makes it sound like balls-out macho food, but it really isn’t. For here are pearly fillets of hot smoked Torbay sole, with bright slices of pickled apple on one side and tangles of pickled onion on the other. Carrots, the colour of a moors sunset, are smoked and dressed with sunflower seeds, and a sweet-bitter porter glaze. Best of all are spring greens, given only a few moments in a hot pan, with what’s described as a pork and seafood sauce, but which Alisdair, who delivers all the dishes, says is closer to a Chinese XO sauce. It is a grand hit of umami. Potatoes have been long-smoked over that fire outside, until split, sweet and saggy, then dropped into the deep-fat fryer to crisp. Only someone with a grown-up appetite would do such an outrageous thing. The restaurant menu isn’t much more refined. It’s just about the creation of an order. There is the revelation of raw mackerel that has been “aged”, like beef, for three weeks, to become deep, dense and intense, served with the bitter hit of brassicas. Stumps of young leek have been braised in butter, then dressed with new-season garlic, pickled plum and the intense savouriness of miso. White and brown crab meat from Whitby is bound in the crisp green of fresh spinach and ground elder leaves. A dish called “dock pudding”, made with the soft bite of braised pearl barley, uses young dock leaves and then lifts them with the addition of an oyster cream. There is nothing overwrought about any of this. Each is just a couple of thoughtful ideas working together. There is only one meat dish: hogget, held over the grill until soft and pink and outrageously smoky, with a sweet, piquant ground-ivy jelly. After that we are given a pot of tea made with wild mint, gooseberry and birch leaf. I expect a subtle infusion. Instead it is sweet and sour, powerful and completely soothing. We finish with a “rowan shoot” ice cream, smothered with a berry compote. I have no idea what rowan shoots are meant to taste like, but this is fragrant and earthy, like the waft of the best perfume caught on the air. Finally, in a nod to locale, there is punchy ginger parkin with honeycomb. I suppose I could moan about the all-natural wine list, but Aimee recognises the need for something that doesn’t taste like it’s been filtered through a porcine duodenum. She finds us a crisp chardonnay. In any case, whatever the ambition, this is still a pub. They serve pork scratchings and beer. At weekends they have seafood barbecues. It’s a schlep up the hill to get there, but they don’t give the impression of wanting to be some place of sombre pilgrimage. They just want to do their thing. By God are they doing it well. Jay’s news bites I felt the same raging excitement at the Moorcock Inn as I did the first time I ate at the now internationally regarded Sportsman at Seasalter in Kent back in 2002. It’s still a knackered old pub down by the sea and Stephen Harris’s cooking is still as take-no-prisoners thrilling as ever. The current tasting menu includes roast partridge with celeriac ‘risotto’, turbot braised in vin jaune with smoked pork and a Bramley apple soufflé (thesportsmanseasalter.co.uk). New app 24hourLondon could offer a solution to the problem of restaurant no-shows. It provides info on bars and restaurants near you that are still serving if you don’t want to call it a night. They are now looking for investment to enable venues to send users offers or alerts if tables become available (24hourlondon.co.uk). Meanwhile, in Cardiff the owner of Bully’s, a former AA restaurant of the year, Wales, has apologised for tweeting the phone number and email of a no-show. ‘It was fuelled by emotion,’ Russell Bullimore later said.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(491,'2018-12-07T10:00:13Z','Folkestone Wine Company, Kent:  ''It''s imperfectly perfect'' – restaurant review','On the train home from The Folkestone Wine Company, I decided that one Christmas I will pen a niche toilet book (potential audience: me) that denotes the emotions of restaurant critics for which we do not have words. Think The Meaning of Liff, but written by a woman in danger of gout. A Boswell Glop, for example, is a restaurant that makes you angrier and hungrier in 11 incremental, foam-festooned courses. Findango’s Reach is a terrible, mega-hyped wonder-restaurant that exists only in the hyperbole of its marketing intern. And a Snuffly-Ligget is a place so imperfectly perfect – just like The Folkestone Wine Company – that I want to ditch the review to protect it from idiots. This is a small, 26-seat, independent labour of love up a pretty street near Folkestone harbour. It has a doorbell that bings as you enter to alert one of the two members of staff. David Hart, the chef, and front-of-house Polly Pleasence sell good European wines by the bottle and glass – robust, smooth and fizzy ones; they’ll knock you up a good negroni, too. There’s something for everyone, plus, to complement the boozing, a pleasing menu served on mismatched crockery. Hart has worked for Stephen Harris at The Sportsman and has run several places across Kent. Pleasence recently had a hand in The Goods Shed, a twinkly, Dickensian-feeling market-restaurant next to Canterbury West station, of which I’m a terrific fan. The duo describe themselves as “wine enthusiasts” rather than experts, which is a hugely valid stance. Polly sold me a bottle of silky appassimento Salento in the sort of misty-eyed way you’d hug a kitten before sending it off to a good home. A tiny bar hosts a small, Dansette-style record player that pipes out Grover Washington Jr and Hank Mobley. The blackboard on the wall heralds a scant five or six options, using locally sourced Kent produce that is bought in each day: Ottinge Court Farm dairy or seafood from Griggs in nearby Hythe. On the day we visit, starters are oysters Fines de Claire, mussels with garlic and parsley, and a plate of coppa ham with pear and hazelnuts. Mains are gnocchi, hake or pork. The chef likes to end each day with an empty cupboard, so he can start again the next from fresh, and it’s this type of homespun, glorious pig-headedness that I want to preserve and conserve. Not everyone will get it. After my visit, I looked at TripAdvisor, because I’m a masochist, and it’s either that or jam pencils into my eyeballs. And among the general rapturous adoration for The Folkestone Wine Company, I found moans that the menu is too brief, that some dishes are quickly sold out, that the position of some tables means you can see into the kitchen and, more awful than all of this, that the doorbell tinkles occasionally. This is why I err before discussing bijou, delicious, slightly eccentric, definitely raffish and louche British gems such as this. Doing so can only lure the demons who will seek to destroy it. They will not like the humble plates of plump, gigantic olives, the glasses of crisp vouvray and the fresh, sweet soda bread with salted butter, which one consumes while Folkestone locals wander in to book birthday meals and anniversary dinners with Polly. They will possibly complain that, at £17, a main course of perfectly pan-fried fresh hake fillet topped with squid and a vibrant, zesty gremolata is too pricey, without empathy for how hard it is for places such as this even to keep the lights on. Regardless, I liked the place a lot. I loved the wonderful, sating bowl of wobbly autumn gnocchi stirred through a mess of wilted, buttery leeks and generously smothered in truffle. The cheeseboard, which is a lot of fun to linger over, was a brie de meaux, a Lincolnshire poacher and a Barkham blue with a homemade chutney. If I have one resounding memory of my day in Folkestone, it is of the thick wodge of French toast served with fresh raspberries, raspberry coulis and fresh clotted cream. For me, this was less of a pudding, more a rumination on the brevity of the human existence and the farce of maintaining a small bottom. Someone I know liked this restaurant so much, they went three times and are now moving to Folkestone. There are many, many awful reasons you may have to pack up a van and start a new life, but eating oysters and drinking Baron Albert Brut in Folkestone isn’t one of them. • The Folkestone Wine Company 5 Church Street, Folkestone, Kent, 01303 249952.

Meal for two, including drinks and service £100 One train is cancelled. Another sits outside Swindon for an hour, unwilling to enter, as if it’s been there before and is in no hurry to repeat the experience. A sizeable cab ride will be required to reach my destination. And I am hungry; properly hungry in a way I haven’t been since 1986 and that incident in Athens at the end of a back-packing trip when I ran out of money and considered eating pages of Let’s Go Europe for the sheer bulk. I am a control freak with absolutely no control of my situation. None of this should matter. The effort it requires to reach a restaurant is not the restaurant’s fault. It was my own stupid idea to ignore the cruddy state of the railways and book a table. And yet I would be lying ferociously if I tried to pretend none of this impacted upon my mood, however much I tried to disperse the red mist. What’s more, where the Painswick is concerned, I was already battling my own prejudices. On the one hand, this boutique Cotswolds hotel boasts a chef, Jamie McCallum, who has worked with Gary Rhodes and once ran the kitchen at Anthony Demetre’s extremely pleasing and reliable restaurant Wild Honey in London. On the other, the website is home to some of the worst copywriting committed since Caxton first cracked open the ink. According to this website they “are all about breaking the rules, plating up a sort of ‘contemporary contradiction’ of fresh, punchy and accurate cooking, treated to a little bit of guilt free”. Somebody sat down, put fingers to keyboard, wrote that, punched the air and doubtless took the rest of the afternoon off. What is contradictory about accurate cooking? And what is so very now about that contradiction? And how the hell do you treat ingredients to a little bit of “guilt free”? Do you murder kittens in front of the walk-in fridge and then laugh manically while shouting: “Don’t worry about it”? And while we’re at it, which rules are they breaking? The Geneva Convention? The one about no heavy petting at the local baths? The offside thing in football? Apart from a brutal mangling of the English language, it’s also more bollocks than you’ll see on a prize ram at the Lambeth Country Show. McCallum’s cooking doesn’t contradict anything and it isn’t worryingly contemporary. It’s just really solid, extremely enjoyable stuff served in one of those honey-coloured sandstone hotels that make even the most hard-hearted of us dream of Bridget Jones mini-breaks. The dining room is designed by somebody with a serious line in muted tones, parquet flooring, dado rails and oatmeal-coloured banquettes. On a hot summer’s day after the journey from hell, it is exactly where you want to be, watching the butterflies fluttering by the open, mullioned windows and clutching a glass of Spanish rosé the colour of the latest Dita von Teese underwear collection. To anybody who has ever eaten at the London restaurants run by McCallum’s former boss, Anthony Demetre – Arbutus, Les Deux Salons and now just Wild Honey – the cooking will be familiar. It’s confident bistro food aimed at a grown-up crowd. You admire the good taste and technique without being distracted by it. Long-braised pork is finely shredded, spun through with fresh herbs, pressed, then seared in a hot pan until the surface is crisp. It’s served in an oblong so sharp you could use it as a ruler. There’s a dollop of a coarse salsa verde and one chargrilled spring onion. (A word on portion size: occasionally people study the pictures that accompany these reviews, and whine about the amount on the plate. Doubtless they’re looking at this starter right now and rolling their eyes. They can stop. Do I look like a man with a bird-like appetite? Do I look like someone who can be satisfied with a postage stamp of lunch delivered with a bow and a heel click? Of course I bloody don’t. If I don’t whinge about portion size, rest assured it was enough for me. Which means it’s enough for you. And if it isn’t, you are the one with the problem.) That pork dish is built on the classic restaurant trick of getting all the hard work in early – the slow cooking, the shredding, the pressing – so you spin it quickly into something very pleasing on service. The same method is used in a main course of slow-cooked lamb, with the brisk summery delights of peas, broad beans and fronds of shimeji mushroom. The lamb has been rolled and bound, slow-cooked, chilled and sliced up before being seared. You could argue it’s exactly the same as the pork preparation and I would argue back that I really like it. A thick fillet of sea bream comes with roasted Jersey Royals, roasted beetroots and a deep, thick, languid beetroot purée. Hiding underneath is a seared baby courgette. It’s a plate of care and attention, colour coordinated with the blue porcelain. We finish with a very dark chocolate delice with soused cherries and a sour cherry sorbet, and another dish of strawberries and meringue laid over an avocado purée. I’m probably meant to roll my eyes at the latter, in some desperate attempt to put a bit of space between me and soya-mocha-drinking hipsters, but it’s more than inoffensive. It’s creamy and a little grassy, as though it were an edible form of the lawn you might sit on for a bowl of those summer strawberries. Not everything is perfect. A deep bowl of gazpacho, while refreshing on this hot day, is just a little underpowered. The good ones deliver a powerful whack. This one is just a little too polite. The bread we are served has seen better days, those days probably being the ones before we arrived. The main course pricing, mostly at north of £20 a dish, is enthusiastic. Then again, there is a good-value £25 set lunch menu, from which the gazpacho, bream and strawberries came. What matters most though – more than the terrible copywriting or quibbles over chilled Spanish soups – is the mood with which lunch at the Painswick leaves you. We slip out to the gardens where, in the mid-afternoon heat, the butterflies continue to flutter and England settles in its soporific haze. And we conclude that a day which started so very badly has, courtesy of the civilising powers of a good lunch, turned out all right in the end. News bites Nearby in Northleach is the Wheatsheaf, part of the Lucky Onion group. I spent most of my review raving about what was then called the Marathon pudding, but which now, presumably for legal reasons, they call a chocolate and peanut pudding. It’s basically a spoonable Snickers. The menu that proceeds it is classy bistro fair: oysters, asparagus with hollandaise, gin cured salmon, liver and bacon and so on. The perfect bolt-hole (theluckyonion.com). Barbarians of the week award goes to the tawdry Italian café Granaio, which has popped up in the glorious Criterion space on Piccadilly Circus. The Criterion is famed for its golden mosaic ceiling. So what have they done? They’ve fitted a false ceiling and covered it with vines that don’t look like they’ll need watering any day soon.

Visit parliament.uk to book. Meal for two including drinks and service £180 Many wretched schemes have been devised within the Houses of Parliament to separate the British from their money, in return for scant reward. There’s the poll tax, which was a charge on breathing. There are VAT increases, instituted to sort out a financial mess you didn’t make. To these should be added one more: the shameful price they are charging to serve mediocre cooking to hapless members of the public. The idea is delightful. The Houses of Parliament belong to us all. Security allowing, we should be allowed in. So why not open up the dining rooms to those eager to dine literally like a lord, or even just like Michael Gove? Periodically they open bookings for tables in the Members’ or the Strangers’ Dining Room. The dinner service in the Strangers’ Dining Room continues on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings until mid-July. Further dates will soon be announced, which is unfortunate. There is a complex online booking process. You need to fill in a form, give a credit card number and promise to bring ID. But they do big the whole thing up. There is talk of “award-winning chefs” without saying which awards they’ve won. They mention “top-end British cuisine” and that “classic styling comes in the form of white tablecloths”. Be still my beating heart. So you turn up and they x-ray your bag and search you (though, interestingly, never ask to see that ID). Through the great echoing vault of Westminster Hall you trot, up the stairs and into the grandly painted lady that is the Central Lobby between the Commons and the Lords. Stop and look up at the glorious ceiling. To be here at the epicentre of our democracy is a thing. Please be a little awestruck and breathless. It will help you put off breathing in for as long as possible. Because when you do you will be whacked by the essence of British institution: the fetid smell of boiled cabbage. I wouldn’t normally complain. This really is a British institution. Inside it looks like every minor public school or corrupt Oxbridge college that ever spat out a mildly dysfunctional beta male with a quiet interest in ornithology, onanism and flagellation. It should smell of boiled cabbage. But here’s the thing. The dinner menu in your future is going to cost you – deep breath – £65 a head, before drinks, service and self-loathing. All that, and the smell of stewed brassicas. Still, onwards we go to the Strangers’ Dining Room, around the corner from the Lobby, or more correctly into an overflow room next door. The wood panelling is thick, the paintings glower, the carpet is a violent migraine-floral and beyond the window, the Thames shimmers as dusk approaches. The front-of-house staff are loyal retainers of a certain age. They feel like Westminster lifers, here to serve, in a sturdy way, until their hips give out. This incursion by the public, and that table of Japanese tourists over there, seems to unsettle them. I want to give them a hug and whisper that we’ll all be gone soon along with our filthy, raised expectations. Certainly, they don’t co-ordinate anything with each other. They’ll all have a cheery crack at taking your order even when it’s been taken. Each will try to pour your wine even when you’ve already asked to pour it yourself. That £65 three-course menu offers four choices per course plus petit fours, coffee and a side order of profound regret. It’s an overwritten document name-checking lots of flavours that go missing in action. Likewise, the food it describes represents a kitchen straining at a modernity it might have read about once in a magazine. White crabmeat is mixed in with too much crème fraîche, until loose and floppy. It’s meant to slap you with mustard but doesn’t. There’s a disc of flavourless kohlrabi over the top. It claims there’s fresh chilli in there but we can’t find it. On the other hand, there are lumps of pineapple. What I have thus learned: pineapple and crab hate each other. Another starter brings a serviceable salt beef terrine with capers and what is called “beef dripping sourdough crisp”. Look, if you’re going to promise me rendered cow fat, I want to taste cow fat. I can’t. Both mains are roast dinners that have been at Mum’s dressing-up box. They look like grown-up plates of cooking but the more you dig in the less you get. There are over-reduced Marmitey sauces, and vegetables that have been less trimmed than given the full Brazilian. What the hell happened to the rest of them? My lamb dish looks like Mr McGregor’s garden. They’ve sliced all the baby carrots off at the knees so they stand vertical. There are two small pieces of lamb and “almond croquettes”, which taste not of almond. The potatoes on a chicken dish are so small and turned they look like those grooved dowling rods Ikea gives you to assemble a set of bookshelves called Billy or Hemnes. And back we swirl to price. Imagine £15 of that £65 went on the starters. It’s outrageous, but let’s just try imagining that. It means they’re charging £40 or so for those mains. Chuck on a £35 bottle of wine because there’s little choice below that and with service you’re on £180. You can go to 98% of restaurants in London for less than £180. The waiters will be pleased to see you and the room won’t smell of ruined cabbage. Instead you’re here, waving in a tiny £10 marzipan tart which is light on the marzipan and a rhubarb mousse that tastes of existential angst. Oh, and it takes just 70 minutes. We sit down at 8pm. At 9.10pm, desserts are cleared. It’s meant to be accessible to the public, but cost is its own special barrier. What’s most troubling is I suspect they don’t know. The kitchen probably thinks this mediocrity is cutting-edge stuff. It’s not. It’s banqueting food at a ring-road hotel. It’s cutting edge as cooked by people who haven’t eaten out enough. And yes, I know the building needs renovating but that’s what I pay my taxes for. I’m not subsidising the works by overpaying for sliced bloody carrots. It could have been a carnival of Britishness: of perfect suet puddings, ribs of beef with horseradish followed by trifle. Instead, as well as a nasty taste in my mouth, it left me thinking that the problem with parliament really isn’t just the politicians. News bites If you want that British institution thing done right, head to the Guinea Grill just off Berkeley Square, central London. It’s the place for prawn cocktails, steaks, Beef Wellington, smoked salmon and steak and kidney pie. Their mixed grill is a thing of beauty and includes ox heart, calf’s liver, lamb’s kidney and a bunch of other things besides. The wine list is big on huge French reds (theguinea.co.uk). Chef Alexis Gauthier of his eponymous Soho restaurant plans to take the entire menu vegan within two years. Speaking at a Restaurant Magazine conference recently, he said he would not ‘be creating any new dishes involving meat and fish or things with eggs and butter’. It’s always interesting to see what the bestsellers are from Amazon’s online grocery business. Right now the No 1 bestseller in confectionery is a pack of Grenade High Protein Low Carb bars.

Meal for two, including drinks and service, £100 All you ever want to know is that everything’s going to be OK. You want to know that deciding to spend your money in a particular restaurant is not a gross, humiliating error of judgment. It could be the flashing white teeth of an engaged welcome that reassures you. Perhaps it’s the immediate offer of a drink, rather than treatment designed to inflame abandonment issues. It could be the writing of the menu, which suggests a kitchen with good taste and a modicum of basic literacy. A misplaced apostrophe can put me right off my roasted beetroot’s. Stem on Princes Street, just off Regent Street, is far too small for the first welcome ever to be easy. There’s nothing wrong with the way it’s done; the staff are a delight and appear to have all their own teeth. It’s just that you walk through the door right into the middle of the room and quickly become the subject of uninterested gazes from the other diners, momentarily distracted from their conversation about how Brexit has all the charm of a self-administered colonoscopy, or the weirdness of the Waitrose essentials range, or how odd it is that Jo Malone knew what fig smells like when no one else has ever had a clue. This is what the British middle-classes talk about in restaurants. Trust me. I know. I listen. The menu is in good clean English, and full of the language of nowness, mentioning enoki mushrooms and buttermilk, samphire and fermentation. The only apostrophe is in the right place. But the words don’t quite tell you the story. At this point all I have is the lineage, like you have when trying to get into that band everyone else already likes via their third album. Stem is the latest venture from the chef Mark Jarvis, who trained at Le Manoir, and cooked at Texture, the Blueprint Café and the Bingham in Richmond before opening the much-lauded Anglo in Farringdon. He then opened Neo Bistro at the Bond Street end of Oxford Street. But again, all this only suggests promise because I’ve been to neither. I’m still looking for the reassurance. It comes with an amuse-bouche: a tiny, exceedingly crisp tart filled with a deep chive emulsion, all onion kick and adoration, then piled with the tiniest dice of lightly dressed, crunchy green beans. It’s an extraordinary amount of attention to detail for a single mouthful, but it’s attention that pays off. I now trust this kitchen completely. They can do to me and with me as they wish. It helps that they also bake killer sourdough, with the kind of lightly charred crust that has me dredging at the salty whipped butter like there might soon be a shortage of dairy products because of some monumentally stupid act of political folly. Which is obviously a ludicrous idea, but the bread is that good. As is everything here. Some of you may prefer it when I have a horrible time and weep bitter tears of frustration into my violated crème brûlée. Some might prefer to read about the bad instead of the good. In which case, turn away now. Under the leadership of the chef Sam Ashton-Booth, formerly head chef at Story, Stem is very good indeed. It serves classy modern food, which occasionally sounds a little odd but always makes perfect sense on the plate. Shelled Cornish mussels, a deep rust orange, come on a rich meaty reduction with slices of raw cauliflower and soft buttery cabbage. Mussels and gravy should definitely be a thing. I’m declaring it a thing. A frothy white onion soup is intense and velvety, and full of more caramel tones than a toffee shop. In the middle are tidy petals of chargrilled onion for crunch. Next to it is a piece of toasted sourdough, piped with whorls of soft, warm Winchester cheese, all lactic funk and power, and topped with finely chopped spring onions. It’s cheese on toast as imagined by the Borgias after they got bored of the orgies and narcotics and wanted some other, more understated way to express their decadence. A sip of soup. A crunch of cheesy toast. And a slow, gentle nod. Chicken is presented as rectangles of luscious thigh – two of my favourite words when squeezed together – full of brown meat, flavour and depth. The skin is crisped and salty. There is a piece of poached breast, some chargrilled baby leeks, and various purees and lubricants to move it all along. A risotto is made with pearl barley cooked so it still has bite and hasn’t tumbled off into the misery of the jellied. It’s piled with mushrooms which have first been lightly fermented to give a burst of natural acidity. There are hefty shavings of parmesan. For an extra £8 they’ll cover it with Australian black truffle. The dish doesn’t need them. We have a side dish of green beans with “my mum’s favourite dressing” which turns out to involve capers and anchovies. His mum has taste. Desserts are overshadowed by the pre-dessert: a brisk lime leaf granita, which sits atop whipped, sweetened cream cheese and a shattered biscuit crumb. It’s not exactly a deconstructed cheesecake; it’s just three spoons full of loveliness. After that there are squares of soft carrot cake, with a fragrant ginger ice-cream; a “Stem mess” is various takes on strawberry, meringue, cream, mint and summer. At the end they bring tiny madeleines. It’s all precise without being tweezered and nerdy. But what’s most striking is the price. We are in Mayfair, in a Georgian townhouse. There are unexpected little tasters, the usual outriders of constipated fine dining and a bill that will rob your kids of their inheritance. But three courses here will come in at just under £30. Starters are about £7.50 and mains in the mid-teens. I’m not going to repeat the lesson about cheapness and value being different things. The hard of thinking will gawp at the numbers whatever I say. The rest of you just need to know that for this quality of cooking in this location, the price point is enough to restore your faith in humanity. You could spend more. For £60, they’ll serve you a 10-course tasting menu. Another £40 will get you the wine pairings, and suddenly you’ve made it to £100 a head. Well done. But with a bottle of wine from the lower reaches of the list, we don’t break £100 between us. That’s called good news. More importantly, we have been fed delightfully. News bites Stem reminded me of Picture, just up the road on Great Portland Street. The room is smart but essentially a blank canvas. The thoughtful cooking is left to speak for itself. Crisp pressed pork comes with watermelon and pickled red onion. Grilled chicken turns up on a delightful mess of sweetcorn and trompette mushrooms. Desserts are various creamy things (picturerestaurant.co.uk). Eat17, which made its name producing stupidly moreish bacon jam, before expanding into chilli bacon jam and chorizo jam, has a new product. Chinese bacon jam is made with five spice, soy and sesame oil. And, y’know, bacon. Because bacon improves everything (eat17.co.uk). Angela Hartnett’s Murano in Mayfair is celebrating its 10th anniversary. To mark the milestone, they are holding a series of guest chef dinners, beginning on 11 September with Mitch Tonks from the Seahorse in Dartmouth and Mark Hix from his eponymous group. Both restaurants are also celebrating their 10th birthdays. Tickets are £75 (020 7495 1127).

I’m through. And, yes, this might be the most princessy utterance my lentil-loving paymasters have ever published, but bear with me. Years ago, during a heinous dinner at The Keeper’s House in the Royal Academy (a Peyton restaurant lodging within a Palladian mansion dating from circa 1664), that I walked out of mid-entree, I began hatching a theory that old, protected buildings and pricey food should never meet. They are a clash of cultures. The hospitality world is the refuge of nocturnal, lamb-fat-stained crackpots who want to “push envelopes”, cater to the drunk until at least 11pm, and nurture atmospheres of warmth and largesse. Meanwhile, all museums, stately homes and National Trust properties are run by dusty committees of vehemently opinionated, single-interest protectionists. These people do not eat. They live mainly on dust inhaled from voluminous rulebooks. Perhaps this is why there are no signs for Bryn Williams during the half-mile walk from The Strand to your dinner table in the south wing. It’s a similar set-up with Spring, Skye Gyngell’s place, also at Somerset House, which again is very tastefully done, but has all the cheer of a nuclear winter. Worst culprit of all, I’ll wager, was 42 Raw in the Royal Academy (now closed), an expensive, wellness-focused dining experience in a room four times higher than it was wide and an ambience chillier than the £17 raw “Thai noodles” (magimixed carrot tossed in sesame oil). You know what would have been better in all these places? Somewhere selling fruit scones with a tiny ramekin of jam and the option of buying a nice commemorative postcard. If your stately building needs extra revenue, just open a bloody tearoom. If you already have one, open a spare. People need tea. Nevertheless, I booked to eat at Bryn Williams’ new place because Odette’s in Primrose Hill, where he is chef patron, has a strong reputation, and also because the menu is veg-centric, making plant-based things “the star of the show”, which is a way modern chefs dally with vegetarian and vegan cooking without going the whole, ahem, hog. Williams’ food is all about “sustainability, seasonality and provenance”, and the menu uses odd syntax such as “field mushroom, confit shallots, rib-eye steak, triple-cooked chips” as if the words are doing a fan-dance over the dead cow clearly dominating that plate. Or: “grilled hispi cabbage, apple, pork chop, cider dressing” – no font or clever comma will make these sentences sound anything less than arse-about-face. Still, I admire the veg-championing spirit, even though Bruno Loubet tried to do this type of thing with Grain Store, and that place closed and now he lives in Australia. The room, once you have completed your mission to locate it, is sage-coloured and leather-banquette-strewn, and feels a bit like sitting for a Holbein painting. Mock-vintage vignettes of ye olde fruit festoon the walls as the odd nautical nod to the fact the wing was occupied by the navy from 1789-1873. Many of the clientele possibly remember this period. The food ranges from pleasant to peculiar. A snacky pre-dinner warm loaf of soda bread transpires to be the highlight. A starter of discs of heritage beetroot, a piece of cured organic salmon and a blob of smoked rosemary mayonnaise feels simpler than a Celebrity MasterChef plate. Another starter, a scattering of pickled radishes and apple over a piece of damp pork belly with a large wobbly piece of fat attached, is simply unappetising. I manage almost none of the tough roast cauliflower, half an unspliced head, topped with golden raisins, capers and salted grapes, because, even for a vegan-food cheerleader – I seek this stuff out daily, damn it – the dish is a mess. My guest has red mullet, which was allegedly grilled, with a peculiar olive tapenade in tempura batter and roast broccoli. The puddings are clearly pre-made, but the passion fruit and banana baked vanilla cheesecake is definitely passable. We left as soon as possible, largely to escape the piped jazz muzak or any more cocktails such as the Blood and Mescal, served in a cheap highball glass, without garnish. As we left, security eyed us as if we were a nuisance, symbols of the downside of building revenue, treating the place like a restaurant when it is, in fact, living history. In truth, I can’t say I disagree. Bryn Williams at Somerset House, South Wing, Somerset House, The Strand, London WC2, 020-7845 4646. Open Mon-Sat 10am–4pm; 6pm–10pm; Sun 10am-4pm.

Meal for two, including drinks and service £60-£130 My late mother had no truck with religious observance. She preferred cultural signifiers of her Jewishness like a full fridge, a belief in the utilitarian qualities of cake liberally applied and a hatred of silence at the table. There was, however, one way in which she observed Jewish religious ritual, though she was utterly bewildered when I pointed it out to her. She liked to cook gefilte fish, that sustaining mix of ground white fish, bound with matzo meal and sweetened with sugar. It comes in two forms. There is the boiled, served cold with its own fishy jelly, an abomination I always regarded as the closest food could come to cruel and unusual punishment. And then there is the fried, which is a different matter altogether. It should be crisp and golden outside and light and fluffy inside. Cooking them made the house smell of indulgence. I would watch them being lifted from the oil with a slotted spoon to the rack to cool a little. At which point I would try to take one and would have my hand verbally slapped away. “Not until they’re cold.” I was baffled. Eventually I became old enough to do a bit of reading and investigation. Gefilte fish is food for the Sabbath, when no work can be done. They are to be cooked in advance, so the family has something ready for after sundown. Hence, by necessity they are served cold. My mother, who saw religious dogma (rightly) as the cause of so much suffering, had carried one small piece of it into her kitchen, from her adored grandmother’s. When I pointed this out, she was horrified. She let me eat one hot. God, it was good: the just-fried shell, yielding beneath my teeth, giving way to gusts of hot, sweet fishy steam and soft white flesh. Oy, and as I believe some people still say, Vey. In what I recognise may be one of the greatest dietary non-sequiturs of all time, I have long felt the same way about pork pies. I bloody love a pork pie. All culinary traditions have a way of using up bits of animal that might otherwise go to waste, and the pork pie is one of our noblest. I love the interplay of crisp, animal fat-boosted hot water pastry, the dense meaty filling, punched up with white pepper, and then the jelly, reintroduced back to the tight cavities from which it has leaked during cooking. The thing is, I have always wondered how marvellous one would be straight out of the oven. Hence I must give thanks for chef Calum Franklin and his pie-fetishising menu at the Holborn Dining Room, the restaurant of London’s Rosewood Hotel. His hand-raised pork pie, the lid twisted into pleats at the corners, is served hot from the oven, with a light gravy that speaks loudly of reduction, calves’ feet and care. The compressed filling is made with smoked bacon and is a bold expression of pig. The case is perhaps a little dark in places, but as a man who burns his toast on purpose, I’m not going to complain. It snaps and crunches. Readers often note the cost of a meal at the restaurants I review, and wince. I put a price on the works, which is to say three courses plus a bottle of wine between two and water. There are always cheaper ways, and at the Holborn Dining Rooms these pies are one of them. That glorious pork number costs £20, with gravy, and will set you up for the day. If you can get a cheaper one at your local pub, go right ahead. It won’t be any good. It will be that pork cyst, from Mike Leigh’s Life Is Sweet, executed with aggression and disdain, and packed away in a shell of edible MDF. It won’t come with brilliant gravy. It won’t be served hot and you won’t get to eat it in a bustling brasserie with leather banquettes and shiny bits of brass, lots of parquet and hanging lights with bare filamented bulbs. It won’t be served to you by gorgeous waiters wearing tartan trousers. And your pub won’t have a dedicated pie room, full of honey-coloured pie moulds, waiting for Franklin’s brilliant pastry-clad wonders. But really, go ahead. Enjoy your lesser pork pie. Part of this bluster is because I feel stupid for not having come here before. It’s like there was a shop making beautiful shoes that would fit me perfectly all along but which I ignored in favour of someone flogging awful floppy loafers. I came because of my recently published rant about things restaurants do badly, which included pies. I said they send out casseroles with lids. And many do. But, as others pointed out, there’s always Calum Franklin doing things properly at the Holborn Dining Room. The day we are there the pie list includes a chicken, girolles and tarragon number, a potato, Comté and caramelised onion option, a steak and kidney suet pudding and a curried mutton pie. I also order the latter. It comes in a flaky pastry case and is a wonder of soft, yielding meat and potatoes in a robustly spiced gravy. There is more of the same in a jug on the side. It’s surrounded by mango salsa. If it had been winter, we would have thrown on chips, because carbohydrate squared is always the way to go; but it’s summer so we eat our glossy spring greens and a salad of the sweetest tomatoes with shallots and basil, and still crave a lie down later. There were starters: tangles of deep-fried squid tentacle with mayo, boosted by the liberal addition of gentleman’s relish, the great anchovy paste that makes you blink and smack your lips. We tried their Scotch egg, which won the annual competition. It’s not a great piece of innovation: it’s just all done perfectly. The sausage meat casing is ripe and crisp in all the right places. The yolk runs. It is still warm. To clinch it, for dessert they serve a perfect Paris-Brest, the bicycle wheel-shaped choux pastry circle, filled with praline cream, with added bits of praline for crunch. There may have been an elderflower jelly with mascarpone ice cream, because I take my job seriously. Naturally enough there’s a wider menu, of butch steaks and robust salads. They do hot-buttered shrimps and Cornish crab toast and hurrah for all that. But if you came here and didn’t order a pie, you would be a complete idiot. Don’t let me down. News bites At the other end of the scale, Piecramaba, in both Winchester and Southampton, can satisfy both your pie and vintage magazine needs. Their pies have names like Holy Cow, Billy the Kid and Al Piecino, and come from both their own kitchens and Pieminster. Sides – creamy, cheesy or mustardy mash; minted mushy peas – are good, too. A single pie costs £5.75 (piecaramba.co.uk). For the rest of July, chef Ravinder Bhogal’s restaurant Jikoni, in London’s Marylebone, will be serving “community lunches”, priced at £12, with £1 donated to Marylebone Food Cycle and the Felix Project. Platters will include the likes of coriander-stuffed sardines, sour pomegranate chicken, or potato, onion and herb pakoras (jikonilondon.com). Clean freaks of the world unite.

Following my recent aerial bombardment of words over a fancy Ullswater restaurant, some readers seemed let down. Surely, they gasped, I’d keep schtum due to my local loyalties? The hectoring service, which signalled a chef clearly wanting to clock off, the tired menu and shoosh of table-disinfectant past my lughole: couldn’t I turn a blind eye? No. The first rule of being a restaurant critic, as opposed to someone who stands on a dining chair like an errant toddler and snaps Instagram content, is that a critic should offer, if need be, criticism. And things closest to our hearts often get special drubbings because we know the subject backwards. Terrible British tourist destination dining, where guests are treated like a necessary evil and the shutters are down by 4pm, is my pet hate. The Lakes are by no means the worst culprit. I’ve pitched up in Cornwall on several occasions to find the southwestern tip of Britain shut. The Suffolk Coast: you can suck one, too. But Fellpack, in the north Lakes, which opened in June 2017, feels gloriously fresh. Almost as if they’re happy to have you. Janglingly unjaded, in fact. I’ve added this to my “lovely Lakes” list, alongside The Chalet in Portinscale and The Lingholm Kitchen close to the foot of Catbells. Fellpack is a bright-spirited, welcoming bistro run by a jubilant bunch of youthful, mountain-fixated friends. Not many restaurateurs will serve slow-cooked Texan beef with a feisty jalapeño glaze while gently cajoling you to tackle the 379 metre “beginners’ mountain” Walla Crag so they can add you to their Walla Dash “notable times” board. But, leading by example, Fellpack’s website shows Chris Gill and the gang scaling peaks, perspiring in singlets and clinging to snowy rocks. It’s feasibly all this fresh air and forays into the Bob Graham Round (42 peaks in 24 hours) that makes Fellpack’s ambience so chipper; they will even send you off climbing with a packed lunch of fresh baguettes of Cumberland ham or a vegan smash wrap (a spot-hitting blend of avocado, black olive tapenade, sun-blush tomato and fresh leaves). Here is a menu that skips cheerily between hearty, northern, fell-running fuel – chilli beef, pork belly – and Londoner-appeasing, quinoa-munching dippiness without breaking a sweat. “Classic fellpots” of pretty local pottery arrive filled with smoky cheddar mac’n’cheese, crisp edamame beans and red chard. If you’re taking grandad, and he’s not down with “oven-baked camembert” or lentil chilli, there’s a mixed local charcuterie platter with cornichons, chutney and warm bread. I took my family on a Saturday night – three adults, one child – and the evening went swimmingly. The “Fellpack gin and ginger beers” are enormous and a bottle of tempranillo is £19.50. They have Hawkshead’s Lakeland lager and Keswick Brewery’s Thirst Run. We shared a gooey camembert and some puddles of rich tahini and feisty chipotle hummus with warm flatbreads. A cumin-and-paprika-enlivened fellpot of lentil and mixed bean chilli with jalapeño and chives was no drab vegetarian affair. That slow-cooked Texan beef appeared with more mac’n’cheese, a rough stew of spiced mixed pulses and some charred corn. An acceptably wobbly chunk of pork belly came atop a deftly seasoned, Spanish-influenced butter bean and chorizo braise with saffron-wafted fregula pasta. Fellpack is not afraid of heat, spice, bold combinations and allowing a quiet majority of its menu to be veg-centric. I love that. In trying to please everyone, you can often please no one at all. There’s an affogato for pudding made from Red Bank coffee, from Coniston. They do a perfect, wet-but-crunchy homemade chocolate brownie with a perky berry compote and vanilla ice-cream. I did not try the nutty chocolate sundae with gooey chocolate pieces, but going forwards, this, to me, feels a more realistic dream than ever reaching the top of Helvellyn. If you’re going to the Lakes this summer, book now. Some of us are built for scrabbling through the scree up Scafell Pike and Great Gable, playing havoc with our cuticles and tormenting mountain rescue. Others, such as myself, are built for sitting lazily in a nearby bistro with a bottle of Thirst Run over several courses of lunch. I know which one of us is winning. • Fellpack 19 Lake Road, Keswick, Cumbria, 01768 771177. Open Thurs-Mon, 10am-10pm (4pm Mon &amp; Sun). About £25 a head, plus drinks and service.

Meal for two including drinks and service £60-£90. The Thomas Carr Seafood and Grill on the high street in Ilfracombe is that mate of yours who could be a huge success if only they got their act together; the one that leaves you tipping your head on one side sympathetically and frowning a little. As a fully functioning restaurant it is, frankly, a mess right now, and they know it. During my lunch I am given rousing speeches about what they want the place to be when it grows up and what it isn’t quite yet. They tell us about the – dread words – “fine dining” restaurant they plan for upstairs, and the outside terrace out back of the lower ground level. But which they haven’t got around to yet. Because, you know, stuff. I can’t help but clock a touch of rising damp down the stairwell to that lower ground level. Unusually for me, I also can’t help giving a commentary on the state of the loos when I return from them. The late Anthony Bourdain once instructed us all to pay acute attention to the hygiene standards in the parts of restaurants you can see, because it’s a clue to the standards in the parts you can’t, but I’ve never been that porcelain-obsessed. Then again, rarely do I see anything like this, which turns me into some Victoria Wood character who wants to bellow: “Brenda, bring me the Marigolds. We’ve got a situation.” There are lots of ill-advised polished metal splashbacks and metal wall panelling which show up every man-drip. Everybody knows men’s toilets are a nightmare of drips and stains. And then there’s the menu, which even our cheery waitress says is a bit weird. It’s a medley of all the greatest hits they haven’t yet had. There’s a mention of chilli beef nachos, which sound like a refugee from a wipe-down menu, alongside something nerdy involving fennel-cured salmon, oyster cream and crispy salmon skin. The latter reads like they’ve been boning up on the menu at Copenhagen’s Noma from 2005. So I’m reading the signals and thinking that the effort it has taken me to get to Ilfracombe on the North Devon coast – a 100-minute drive from Exeter – has been wasted. The room doesn’t help. It’s a huge expanse of bar with a brutal tundra of bare floorboards. There are too few tables, all with mismatched chairs, some of them in a startling mustard yellow. Who looked at those and muttered: “Yes”? Still, they sent me an imploring email when they knew I was going to be doing an event in the area. Admittedly they wanted me to try the tasting menu at the Thomas Carr Olive Room on the other side of town, the mothership with its awards and stars, which the eponymous chef opened in 2015 after years cooking with Nathan Outlaw. However, they also mentioned the recent successful crowdfunding campaign they had undertaken to open this Seafood and Grill. They didn’t at any point mention it was going through a troubled adolescence and best to leave it alone until it grows up a bit and tidies its room. Plus, as I’ve said before, tasting menus make my palms itchy. Which means I’m here and, as ever, being hopeful. That hope is fully rewarded. There are some false starts. If you’re going to offer a lobster macaroni cheese, please don’t overcook the macaroni and don’t forget to be stupidly generous with the cheese. There aren’t many things to get right in mac and cheese. Those are two of them. Likewise, if you mention crispy salmon skin, it had better be so crisp it snaps obligingly between my fingers. These bend, sadly, but the lozenges of fennel-cured salmon they are perched upon are delightful: soft, the right side of oily, with a delicate cure which leaves just enough room for a little light fishiness. The oyster cream is a gentle intervention from the bivalve rather than an overwrought slap. It’s waving, not shouting. Prawns in garlic butter are all four of those words done right. The prawns are plump and so fresh they squeak and bounce beneath the teeth. They sit in a bubbling pond of salty molten dairy fat, silted up with chopped garlic, just begging for a bread intervention. They get it. It’s with the mains that everything really comes into focus. A pearly piece of hake rests in a deep shellfish bisque, given go-faster stripes courtesy of handfuls of lemongrass and ginger. It’s rare that a soup mounted with ladles of cream also feels invigorating and curiously healthy. Perched on top is a quenelle of the sweetest of sweet white crab meat. It’s one of those dishes that reminds you why you made the effort to come and eat this close to the sea, where the seafood is just that little bit brighter and friskier. Skate wing is dressed with brown butter, capers and crayfish, and is one of the best versions of this dish ever laid in front of me. I pull the strands of skate from the cartilage, enjoying the satisfying way the flesh slips from the wing, like it was waiting to be undressed. I shovel up some capers and nutty crayfish, and sigh. There are new potatoes to remind you that this is meant to be a balanced lunch, but all eyes are on that glorious skate. Desserts are hardly earth-shattering, but thoroughly serviceable. The long plank of chocolate brownie is big on squidge, has a pleasingly crisp surface and is joined on the plate by both a clotted-cream ice cream and a spiced, sugared ginger biscuit which snaps obligingly in the way the salmon skin didn’t. A crème brûlée is an extraordinary shade of yellow which almost matches those weird leather seats. If it was a classic version of the dish, I would be standing up and applauding. Unfortunately, they’ve decided to “improve” it through the addition of under-sweetened rhubarb, which is no improvement at all. As you can guess by now, I am going to let the rhubarb mistake slide, partly because of those other dishes (especially those two mains) and partly because whatever the idiosyncrasies of this place and its growing pains, it has a warm, beating heart. It demands to be liked. At lunchtime a starter and a main is just £18, which is a pound less than the à la carte price for that hake dish. Three courses are £24. The value is undeniable. If I were nearby, I would choose to eat here again without hesitation. Take that as a recommendation. News bites Another meal at Parson’s in Covent Garden confirms it’s a class act. Yes, it’s a seafood grill offering up whole fish to share, but the joy lies with the starters and sides: the peppery brown shrimp croquettes, the whipped cod’s roe, the salad of grilled baby gem, prawns and anchovies or the trout tartare with bloody mary jelly. You can put together a serious lunch just from those (parsonslondon.co.uk). The Ottolenghi group is launching a new restaurant in London’s Fitzrovia. Rovi, which will have a small takeaway operation as well as a sit-down restaurant, is majoring on grilled vegetables: the likes of braised and smoked carrots with puffed black barley and pickled herbs, hasselback kaffir lime beets with lime cream and kohlrabi ravioli. The sandwich chain Eat has found a new way to use up leftover bread. They are donating it to the eco-brewery Toast Ale, which replaces a third of the malted barley with bread that would otherwise be wasted.

Meal for two, including drinks and service £140 Scotland is full of extraordinary sights. One of them lies a few miles from the town of Auchterarder. You sweep down off the barren calm of the Ochil hills and quickly find yourself in the midst of a boutique shopping parade flogging cashmere thongs, wild pearl earrings at £1,000 a pop and hyper-expensive watches to people who don’t need to know the time, courtesy of a branch of Mappin &amp; Webb. All of this is located, of course, within the Gleneagles Hotel. It’s a quick turn off the A9 and is therefore either the most expensive motorway services in Britain or, given the many activities on offer, Center Parcs for rich people. Blimey, but it’s odd. Drive past the golf club and the men who have actually chosen to dress like that, and you find yourself amid the agitated clamour of high-end luxe. Outside, the building has all the allure of a disused open-cast mine. The main building is a grey, brooding cliff face designed to frighten off the timid. Inside it is a riot of polish and gloss and art deco flourish, with the occasional outbreak of gloomy corridor. Take a left at reception, watched by a phalanx of crack hospitality commandos who are just gagging to interrogate you, and you come to the shopping parade. It snakes through the building, a tunnel of deep varnished wood and smudge-free glass. Make it through there without somehow having bought a porcelain stag on a hillside, and you come to the spa. More importantly for our purposes, you come to the Birnam Brasserie which appears to be named after the walking forest of Macbeth, not far away to the north. Always fun to have lunch while musing on a play that includes infanticide. At Gleneagles the whole fine dining thing is covered by Andrew Fairlie back up the corridor, where four courses cost £140 a head. The brasserie, which opened a year ago, is the cheaper all-day option. It’s cheaper in the way Knightsbridge is cheaper than Monaco. I’ll be honest. I’m not suggesting you should actually eat there. I suppose if you happened to be passing and had just pillaged the natural resources of a small central Asian country and therefore didn’t mind dropping £27 on a tuna nicoise, you could go. The main draw is the people-watching. But happily, I’m here to do that for you. It’s hilarious: there are the lifted and the scrubbed straight out of the spa, their eyes fixed in an expression of constant, enema’d surprise; there are the senior couples angrily eating their way through their children’s legacy so the ungrateful bastards don’t get their hands on it, and there are the poor benighted middle managers who have been forced here for a day’s team building with the gun dogs. The inside space is a low-ceilinged attempt at an Ivy-like brasserie, complete with central bar. It is empty the lunchtime we are there so we are encouraged out to the glass-roofed atrium area with its living wall. I squint at the foliage. It’s green. Very, very green. The stems of these plants don’t actually reach the ground. The whole thing is plastic. Ah well, given the punters here, the last thing you need is anything else that’s especially high maintenance. The food is a weird mixture of adequate, good and “what were they thinking?” Generally, the menu draws on the French brasserie tradition by way of golf clubhouse. So escargot and steak tartare sit comfortably alongside an £11 BLT and a £26 salmon clam chowder. And yes, I will keep banging on about prices. A £14 frisée salad made with lardons of deeply flavoured dry-cured bacon comes with an unadvertised crisply fried ham hock cake, which the yolk of a perfectly poached egg breaks over tidily. A king prawn, fennel and pink grapefruit salad includes under-ripened avocado that barely snaps. It gets left on the side. Happily, the prawns have been deveined, although at £17 they should probably have been offered a few spa treatments, too. We are asked how we would like the tuna on that £27 nicoise. At that price, a song, a dance and a joke would be welcome before it threw itself willingly on to the plate. It is an unbalanced dish, dominated by the thick piece of tuna, presumably the cause of the price tag. You have to shift it to one side to find a few green beans, a sliced new potato and a shy quail’s egg. The tuna is so big it’s relentless. Much weirder is the special of the day, advertised as a pork and duck confit cassoulet. The fact that it only turns up on Thursdays gladdens my heart. It means there’s time to give this classic dish the attention it deserves. A proper cassoulet should take at least 24 hours to make and should be a celebration of the interplay of ingredients. It’s about the way the cheaper cuts – the pork belly, the gnarly garlic sausage – become so much more than themselves, thanks to time and heat. In a proper cassoulet the humble beans become a vehicle for a certain fatty lusciousness. The breadcrumb crust is pushed in under the surface again and again, thickening the stew. And now I’m practically dribbling at the thought of a real cassoulet. Which this isn’t. At the bottom are white beans in a violent tomato sauce that hates me. The belly, the sausage and the duck confit have been plonked on top. Breadcrumbs are represented by a piece of garlic baguette. It’s a £23 travesty. All desserts are £9 and almost worth the money, as long as you have an exceptionally sweet tooth and a pancreas that’s been training at altitude. There is a baked Alaska, made with fine fluffy peaks of Italian meringue, over which is then poured a salted caramel sauce. A rum baba with caramelised apples is well made and equally sweet. We need thimbles of hot, bitter espresso after that. Service is, of course, perfect. Young waiters march on through the oddness of it all, as if it makes total sense. Which here, in the gilded universe of Gleneagles, I suppose it does. Just not to me. Jay’s news bites The Honours, chef Martin Wishart’s take on a relaxed brasserie in Edinburgh’s New Town, may also help you towards a sizeable bill, but you’ll understand where the money went. The likes of a sea bream tartare or asparagus with egg mimosa are followed by a great menu of grills, alongside an ox cheek bordelaise or roasted Orkney scallops. It’s not clever. It’s just very good (thehonours.co.uk). More evidence of healthy restaurant growth in the English northwest: Samphire Jersey (until recently known as Ormer) in Saint Helier is opening a restaurant and members’ club in a former Liverpool banking building. Chef Shaun Rankin, who won the original Ormer its Michelin star, has left the business and there is no news yet on who will be on the pass in Liverpool. Following news that Byron Burger was closing 20 branches, Gourmet Burger Kitchen has announced losses of £7.8m in the year to February 2018. The owners, Famous Brands, attribute this to the ‘adverse macro-economic environment’. In other words, business ain’t good.

Meal for two, including drinks and service £150+ Set into the back of the yielding, overstuffed seats at Brown’s Hotel on Albemarle Street in London’s Mayfair are what look to me like air vents. I don’t question this. Of course the sort of people who come here sweat more than most; it’s all that Botox and entitlement pumping through their bloodstreams. It’s got to have some sort of impact on their bodily secretions. It turns out the square, brass inflow ducts are actually handles designed to help the waiters move the over-engineered chairs around. Possibly while the clientele are still sitting in them. Everything about Heinz Beck at Brown’s is over-engineered, including the food. Especially the food. The kitchen must be full of pasty-skinned worker cooks, dicing and chopping and chiffonading – it’s not a word, but a place like this demands new ones – as if somebody’s life depended on it. Micro-cubes of edible matter are tweezered into place. Fingerprints are polished off porcelain. Dollops are sculpted. Sculpt that dollop. Sculpt it now! A simple Italian classic like vitello tonnato – thinly sliced veal and tuna sauce – becomes here a spring meadow as painted by a pointillist with OCD. Your eye keeps being drawn into ever smaller details. Lord, they even deep-fried the caper berries. Pointing and laughing is fine. Some occasions demand it. But blatant ridicule only works when it’s greased with honesty. So let’s be straight: very few people would find the food served at this Mayfair version of a casual Italian restaurant actively unpleasant (bar some unforgivably stale carta da musica crispbreads at the start). If you weren’t paying for it or, better still, didn’t look at the prices or the final bill or, best of all, understand anything about how money works, and somebody said: “Here, eat this vitello tonnato with deep-fried caper berries,” you’d clean the plate and say thank you very much and that was nice. You’d probably be thrilled someone bothered to make a sandwich out of two red mullet fillets, or a planet out of hazelnuts. It wouldn’t ruin your day. But my job does involve understanding how money works. It often ruins my day. When you clock that the cheapest glass of wine is £16, a glass of Chablis is £20 and the cheapest full bottle of wine is £37 because it comes from South Africa where the economy is shaky, it becomes deadening and exhausting. Which is precisely what you would expect to happen when a grand hotel asks a chef like Heinz Beck, who has Michelin stars and awards and gilded trophies, to come from Rome to London and give us his version of laid-back. It’s like watching the Archbishop of Canterbury trying on beanie hats. You just know it’s going to end up being awkward and wrong. Not that anybody here seems to be in the slightest bit aware. Here on Albemarle Street, it’s business as usual. Italian food can be finessed. It can be detailed. The word “fine” as in “fine dining” can be applied to it. But it also needs to be comforting. Leave froufrou to the French. The good Italian dishes are the ones you slump over on your elbows as you put the world to rights. I challenge anyone to manage a proper slump here. The walls are half wood-panelled. Above them is wallpaper of birds of paradise flitting from palm frond to palm frond. The banquettes are covered in wildly floral prints. Waiters wear white jackets like lethal weapons (though still manage to deliver dishes in the wrong order). The place is summed up by my £24 starter of spaghetti cacio e pepe, that ultimate crowd pleaser in which a cheesy, peppery emulsion clings to strands of thick pasta. The price tag is courtesy of three lime-marinated langoustine tails, still translucent, that have been plonked on top. They are the definition of unnecessary adornment, their brisk freshness adding absolutely nothing to what should be the warm, even hot, piquant embrace of the pasta. Except this version seems terrified of piquant. When you start grinding extra black pepper on to your cacio e pepe you know something is up. The perfectly enjoyable red mullet sandwich – two fillets, with black olive mush between them, then wrapped in thin dough and fried – comes sliced in half then plonked on salty mashed potato. It is high end processed food. You’re paying £21 for someone else’s hard labour. Chicken breasts with baby gem lettuce and cardoncelli mushrooms looks like a roast chicken dinner reimagined for MasterChef. John Torode would nod approvingly at it, mostly because he’s a nice chap. But it’s odd. The breast is skinless, and therefore a big lump of springy indeterminate protein. On the side is a golden crisp. We both nibble at it, my companion and I, and eventually conclude it may well be the skin after a traumatic experience. It crunches pleasingly, but tastes very little of chicken. The mushrooms turn up in myriad textures. My companion points at the dish and quotes the candelabra’s line from Disney’s Beauty and the Beast: “Try the grey stuff, it’s delicious.” Never trust a candelabra. This grey stuff is soft and lightly acidic. It tastes like it once shook hands with a mushroom. A hazelnut planet is a sphere of chocolate hazelnut mousse bisected by a shiny disc of thin, tempered chocolate, as if Saturn’s rings. Trails of biscuit crumb explode away from it. By far the best dish is a light, bubbling, custardy gratin of fresh raspberries with candied pistachios, a spidery web of pistachio sponge and a little scoop of soft, milky ice cream. It is all those comforting and clever things at the same time. But it comes too late in a meal that has made me wonder about the point of both this venture and, by association, life. It can’t be to create a restful experience. Unless, of course, you’re so fat-walleted that if somebody asked you afterwards how much lunch cost, you wouldn’t have a clue. It’s not the most expensive restaurant in London. There are many other nominees for that title. But it does feel like one of the most pointlessly spendy. At the end, a fretful head chef is press-ganged into standing by the door to find out what you thought of everything. Here, at Heinz Beck at Brown’s, even leaving is an unnecessary ordeal. Jay’s news bites No one would accuse Margot in London’s Covent Garden of being dirt cheap – it’s a classic classy Italian. But the value is obvious. For example, the set lunch menu is £29 for three courses as against £42 at Heinz Beck. They do a strong line in classic pasta dishes, including pappardelle with wild boar ragu. Leave room for some of the best desserts in London (margotrestaurant.com) Deliveroo and JustEats have competition. The founder of EasyJet, Stelios Haji-Ioannou, is launching EasyFood. Rather than taking commission on each delivered meal from restaurants and takeaways, the business will work on a subscription model. It’s launching in Birmingham, then moving into northern cities before taking on London in 2019. Obviously Britain doesn’t have enough burger chains. Happily, it’s to get another courtesy of film star Mark Wahlberg and his brothers. Wahlburgers – geddit? – has 22 outlets in the US. It will open its first London branch in September.

Meal for two, including drinks and service £40-£70 Of all the restaurants serving the food of Mexico, Greece, Japan, France, Italy and Spain in Cromer, Upstairs at No 1 has to be the best. Granted, it’s not a huge field, and thank God for that. Wanderlust is an admirable trait in a 20-something backpacker off to explore the world, armed only with a credit card and a broad-spectrum antibiotic; in a brasserie on the edge of England, not so much. An interest in other culinary traditions is fine. But there’s curiosity and then there’s compulsive promiscuity: a desire to do anything for anyone in the hope they might end up liking you. For example, the “pub classics” section of the menu at a well-known pub chain which will remain nameless to protect the guilty – yes, I have eaten in one; no, it was not OK – includes teriyaki noodles and chicken tikka masala, alongside the “British steak and kidney pudding” as against, presumably, the Lithuanian one. Of course, you could weaponise this and dismiss me as a shameless snob, but that would be missing the point. Real snobbery is an attempt to maintain your own status by sneering at something you don’t understand. It is not snobbery to have standards, or to be suspicious of overly complicated menus, or to think a cheap pub dish of teriyaki noodles and a pint of Foster’s is the definition of hell fashioned from calories. The menu Upstairs at No 1 is genuinely troubling. Who the hell can do ramen alongside tacos alongside a fish-finger sandwich? The answer is, they can. Then again, reputations are at stake. The large blue-painted building, on a corner site looking down on the famed pier, is operated by Galton Blackiston, who has the much garlanded Morston Hall a few miles up the Norfolk coast. In an area like this, word gets around. You can’t just phone it in. So he doesn’t. Downstairs at No 1 is a classic chippie, with a takeaway operation and a comfortable sit-down, wipe-clean restaurant. It has a standard menu of cod or haddock and chips at £12.45, which is what passes for reasonable in these parts, where second homes are rife and the good connections to London have done their worst. But it’s in the brightly lit, pastel-coloured dining room upstairs, under head chef Jimmy Preston, that things get interesting. For the bargains, look to the worryingly named “light bites” menu. Each dish is £6.50 or you can order three for £18, which would be more than enough for one. A generous bowl of battered “popcorn” cockles are served with a spiced salt and a sprightly chilli vinegar. It is food for meditatively picking at, which leaves you licking your finger tips. There’s a polenta-crusted fritto misto of prawns, squid and whitebait dusted with paprika. Alongside is a forceful aïoli the yellow of a seaside sun, which will give you a garlic breath capable of scaring the neighbours. Curiously, the most thrilling of these more traditional things are their mushy pea “fritters”. The dense, sweet-salty peas have been chilled, sliced up, then breaded and deep fried until the centre has started to slip back towards liquid. What makes it is “Tracy’s mint jelly” on the side. I don’t know who Tracy is, but I like her way with mint jelly. It has a salty edge that lifts the whole affair from its origins as mere chip shop also-ran. After that, things get ambitious. Fancy a “Baja fish taco”, with pea mole, pickled chilli and lime mayonnaise? The coarse-ground blue-corn tortillas are as good as any I’ve had in this country. They are nutty and insistent. (There’s a joke here about the Norfolk branch of Ukip but I can’t be bothered to make it.) The perfectly fried fish comes topped with those pickled chillies. The dish isn’t an existential threat to the kitchens of Mexico, but it’s a damn fine mouthful or six. From Greece there is bubbled and blistered flat bread, dressed with feta, mint and strands of lamb shawarma. Spain gives us a sensitively cooked piece of hake with romesco, that one-size-fits-all Iberian condiment of almonds, garlic, paprika and oil, alongside chorizo. Somebody has been on their holidays and taken a lot of notes. It’s the same story with the main courses. Yes, of course they can make a fish-finger sandwich. It’s a giant of a thing, boasting one huge goujon in a soft roll, with a cone of impeccable chips and their hand-chopped tartare sauce. They know how to fry fish. But they also serve crunchy green asparagus under a brown shrimp butter. A firm piece of cod sits on a butter bean and chorizo stew. The fish of the day is a whole lemon sole, precisely trimmed and grilled so it slips off the bone as if it didn’t really want to be there in the first place. And all this fish comes with the sustainability ratings you could wish for. Most ambitious is their ramen. The worst you can say is that it’s trying a little too hard, perhaps to justify the £15.95 price tag. On the side are pieces of pork crackling – I’m not sure why, but I’ll never complain about pork crackling. There’s also a dish of chilli oil, as if they know it should be in the bowl but can’t quite bring themselves to throw it in, in case not everyone in Cromer is game. There is a deep soy broth. There are two huge seared prawns, a large ring of glazed pork belly and two sizable deep-fried wontons, stuffed with spiced minced pork. There is a soft-yolked egg. The noodles are a little overcooked, but only just. The nearest it comes to a crime is being slightly overstacked. I suspect it’s the best bowl of ramen for many miles in any direction. That’s the point. Cromer has fabulous brown crabs, but sophisticated, modern, restless, hungry people cannot live by dressed crab alone. Upstairs at No 1 offers most things to many people who would otherwise have to make a massive effort to get it. The wine is as cheerful as the service and the view at dusk, as the draining sky leaks away into a gunmetal sea, is swoon-worthy. All menu anxieties quickly slip away. There is dessert, the likes of vanilla rice pudding or caramelised brioche with ice cream and salted pecans, but we are done. Sometimes, it seems, a surfeit of culinary curiosity can be a very good thing. Jay’s news bites A new study by booking service OpenTable has found that Glasgow restaurant goers are the most generous tippers in the UK, leaving an average of £5.33. London diners, who used to hold the top spot, have reduced their tips by 12% to an average of £5.01. Nottingham comes bottom at just £3.22. I’ve mentioned it before, but make no apologies for doing so again. It’s May which means the wonderful East Pier smokehouse, in St Monan’s on the Fife coast, is now open from Wednesday to Sunday. They’ll do you a whole hot smoked seabass for £14.50, lobster, crab cakes or Cullen skink. All that, and a dining room perched high above the churning sea. They go seven days a week from June (eastpier.co.uk). Edinburgh chef Tom Kitchin and his wife and business partner Michaela are branching out into the hotel business. They are taking over the Golf Inn Hotel in Gullane, East Lothian and renaming it the Bonnie Badger. Perhaps they love badgers. It will have 12 rooms and a 60-cover dining room.

Meal for two, including drinks and service £70-£110 You have to admire the luscious, greedy, thigh-rubbing instincts of a kitchen that puts a crab chip butty on the menu: a palm-sized, golden-glazed bun, filled with mayonnaise-bound white crabmeat, the crunch of lightly pickled samphire and, finally, a fistful of still hot, still crisp chips. The best food items are mindfulness incarnate. They stop you dwelling gloomily on what you haven’t done today or what you should be doing tomorrow or the size of your thighs or what you could do to Jeremy Hunt if only you had a box of wasps and a bucket of honey. They silence all those thoughts, even the interesting ones about Jeremy Hunt, and make you focus on the thing you’re eating. The crab chip butty at the Duke of Richmond pub is one of those items. It also lays down a marker. The Duke of Richmond, in Hackney, east London, can be taken as simply a neighbourhood pub. And obviously it is. It’s a pub and it has a neighbourhood. You can get a pint at the bar and they’ll sell you a packet of Monster Munch, eagerly. Obviously, they’re pickled onion flavour because why would you bother with anything else? I know this because I had some with my glass of Provençal rosé. But they also want to be more than that. It is just a neighbourhood pub in the way Buckingham Palace is just a house and Piers Morgan is just a little bit irritating. So elsewhere on that bar menu there’s Toulouse sausages with Parisienne lentils and green peppercorn mustard. They serve béarnaise with the chips and make their burgers out of the rib cap, regarded by many as one of the most flavourful cuts of beef. Which is what happens when a chef like Tom Oldroyd takes over a pub. He made his name shaping the menu at the first outlets of Russell Norman’s Polpo group. If you want someone to blame for the whole small plates thing, you could have a go at Oldroyd, but he’s so polite and well-mannered you might find it tough to get into a real shouty argument with him. (And he’d probably point out that the Spanish have a lot to answer for in that department.) After Polpo, he set up the tiny Oldroyd in Islington and now, alongside that, he has this place. It’s a single broad room decorated in shades of olive green and off-white, as if it’s one huge piece of Victorian creamware. The website describes a two-part business of bar and dining room. In reality, this is more than a little artificial. The dining room half of the space is separated from the rest by nothing more than a low dividing wall. On the bar side, the tables are laid only with napkin, knife and fork. On the dining room side, you get glasses on the tables and banquettes to sit on. The divide carries over into service. We ask to mix and match a little from the bar menu and the dining room menu; our waiter tells us that normally they don’t. But it’s a quiet evening because England are playing Colombia in some football tournament or other and the place is deserted so they’re happy to oblige. Yes, we can have that crab chip butty off the bar menu alongside our dining room starters. As it all comes out of the same kitchen and all ends up in the same space, it doesn’t make much sense. Happily, the food really does. Aside from the crab chip butty – did I mention the crab chip butty? – we have a flaky vol-au-vent filled with meaty sautéed girolles, the freshest of English peas and grated summer truffle bound in a luscious jus. A bubbled and buckled tart fine is loaded with sweet sour confit tomatoes, a quenelle of black olive tapenade and another of herbed crème fraîche. The puff pastry – and the sourdough and butter – are all made on site. It’s both a small thing and a big one. They don’t need to do that. Many serious kitchens don’t bother to make their own puff. Here, they do. There are thick slices of lamb from the Hebrides, unashamed of their well-earned ballast of fat, grilled over wood and served with dauphinoise potatoes, courgettes and enough light gravy to swim in. These are British ingredients cooked with an utterly convincing French country accent. There is nothing prissy or mannered here. It’s dinner, made by people who like to feed people who want to be fed. It’s the same with a non-meat main of stuffed and baked yellow courgettes with braised borlotti beans enthusiastically lubricated with a shouty basil pistou. No one would call this an elegant plate of food. If you posted pictures of it online, people might be moved to call the emergency services rather than click “like”. Fair enough. But it is a seriously boisterous plateful. With this we have a salad of crunchy green beans under a dijon vinaigrette, and a side of Lover’s Mash because it sounds naughty. It’s not. It’s mash made from a particular variety of potato, which means nothing to me. It’s a good, solid mash. Two thin-cut slices of watermelon served on crushed ice for £2.50 might get a few people a little cross. It is a shimmering bowl of huge profit margin. However, if you can avoid doing sums in your head, it’s a very lovely thing with which to finish on a hot summer’s evening. A summer berry mess is a plate of red fruit, broken meringue, a loose crème pâtissière and happiness. I end up scraping at the glaze. Prices are standard smart gastro pub: £6 to £8 a starter and low to mid-teens for mains. Amusingly, you can have all six of the starters for £39. There’s also a compact wine list with a fair choice below £30 a bottle. Alongside Sunday lunch – name-checked breeds, extra Yorkshires at 50p a pop – they have a “feasting” menu, which is a silly word for some serious food. Get 10 friends together and they’ll roast you a whole suckling pig as the main of a £35-a-head menu. Other main course options are available but I’m afraid I couldn’t get beyond the words “suckling” and “pig”. It is a mark of where restaurants have got to, that the solidly reliable food pub is no longer worth much comment. So note the 1,100 words I’ve dedicated to this one. The Duke of Richmond is an awful lot more than just reliable. News bites The Marksman pub, nearby in Hackney, is another ambitious foodie boozer. Start with one of their buns filled with curried lamb. Continue with the likes of pollock with pickled fennel or a chicken, leek and tarragon pie for two. If one of chef Tom Harris’s tarts are available for dessert – brown butter and honey, for example – make sure to order it (marksmanpublichouse.com). Speaking at a recent conference, Simon Mitchell, MD of street-food operators Kerb, described the sector as now ‘sustainable in its own right.’ According to him there are street-food operators turning over more than £1m. In 2018, the entire sector will reportedly be worth £1.2bn. The mildly controversial Cereal Killer Café in London’s Brick Lane and Camden is branching out from just bowls of cereal and milk to an all-day menu.

Meal for two, including drinks and service, £80-£120 There’s a glossy kind of over-engineered food television which, whatever its other virtues, provides a brilliant workout for my throwing arm. It’s the cooking demo stuff, narrated by a restaurant chef who insists upon peppering every stage of the process with the word “simply”. Now “simply bone out the entire chicken” or “simply make a brioche dough” or “simply carve a representation of the fall of Saigon out of chilled dripping as a table centrepiece”. While it would be unfair to name the guilty (Gary Rhodes, I’m looking at you for starters), I’m not ashamed to admit it has me reaching for the nearest piece of soft fruit. My aim is getting pretty good. One of the greatest lies ever told by our food media is that all cooking is easy or simple or straightforward. It isn’t. A lot of it is complicated and frustrating and unreliable and, like an outbreak of bantz between Jeremy Clarkson and Piers Morgan, extremely irritating. It takes practice, larded with enough greed to encourage you to press on however often you screw up. You fail, then do it again in the hope that next time, you will fail better. Forget your boudins and your soufflés, your hand-raised pies and boned-out pigs’ trotters. That sort of show cooking may be tough, but trickier still is the seemingly effortless; the edible equivalent of, say, Anthony Hopkins’s performance in The Remains of the Day. For most of the movie Hopkins appears to do nothing. He says little, reacts sparely. But his face tells you all you need to know. Tomos Parry’s cooking at Brat is the culinary equivalent of a Hopkins performance. For the most part it is simplicity itself. Some of it seems to be less cooking than assemblage. And then you eat. Take a dish entitled “chopped egg salad with bottarga”. It’s a thick slice of still-warm toast topped with a crushed mess of an egg, also just still warm, the yolk languidly fixed between solid and soft, overlaid with shavings of cured and dried grey mullet roe. The cosy nursery softness of the egg is punctuated by the salty, grown-up hit of the bottarga. I found myself wondering drowsily about going home and smearing toast with the anchovy-boosted fireworks of Gentleman’s Relish, then pelting it with soft boiled eggs. What larks. Which is how this kind of cooking deceives you. It looks so simple. Surely, it’s more an idea than a recipe. But I suspect that if you went home and tried it yourself, it would be a massive disappointment and the evening would end badly. Parry knows exactly what he’s doing. You’re paying him just £5 to do it. That’s a good deal. Don’t complain. Let him. I first tried Parry’s food at Kitty Fisher’s in Mayfair, which for a while was the restaurant everyone talked about in eye-rolling, hushed tones. I was meant to feel clever just for getting through the door, but the meal I had didn’t quite do it for me. It seemed little more than solid bistro cooking at gold-plated Mayfair, “I have a three o’clock colonic” prices. And yet here, in this clubbable wood-lined first-floor space in Shoreditch (above the latest incarnation of Thai barbecue place, Smoking Goat), it’s a revelation. By the door is the open kitchen, dominated by the sparking embers of the burning coals, because in 2018, every cook worth their hand-mined salt wants to cook like an 18th-century hearth jockey. Who needs gas or electricity when you can singe your eyebrows nightly? The restaurant is supposed to celebrate Parry’s Welsh heritage by way of the open-fire cooking of the Basque country. To complicate things even more, Brat is apparently an old English term for turbot, one of the star ingredients on a short list of major grillable items. Whatevers! And so on. I’m meant to be interested in Welsh heritage and Basque peasant culture, but all I care about is the end result. Here, the end result is a blistered and golden grilled fish. The night we are there, every other table seems to have ordered a whole turbot. It is brought to us by one of the brigade who cheerily points out some of the not-to-be-missed sights, as if it were less a food item than a city mini-break: here are the plump cheeks, over there the rich, oily flesh around the collar, and don’t miss out the pristine fillets. The smaller turbot costs a gulp-inducing £55. Then you start working your way through its flesh and realise there is enough here for three (£65 gets you a bigger fish; find some friends). It is slow-cooked over indirect heat for half an hour and spritzed with vinegar from time to time. The result is a soft, lightly sticky skin that seems to melt on the tongue, and pearly flesh. Alongside is a simply dressed salad of sweet, taut-skinned tomatoes, plus buttery “smoked” new potatoes which have been allowed to slump in on themselves over the fire. This is the pinnacle of a meal with many high points. Before its arrival, we have cockles served in the shell in a light broth thickened with chicken livers. Two discs of a butch wild rabbit boudin come with another of spiced black pudding, on a stew of white beans, with a dribble of salsa verde. An option listed as spider crab, cabbage and fennel leaves me a little breathless. The brown meat has been smeared across the bottom of the plate. Sliced fennel has been slow-cooked then allowed to cool before being mixed with the crab. The cabbage seems to come in the form of the “crispy seaweed” served in Chinese restaurants, the green flecks lending an Asian touch to what is a perfect example of simplicity executed with indecent amounts of skill and good taste. There is lemon tart or baked cheesecake to finish, which is a pleasing change from the “will this do?” of creamy things in a bowl. Both are models of their kind. Happily, the wine list follows Nuala’s lead from a few weeks back by being broken down into categories from unthreatening through classics to fearsome and gnarly. Is it cheap? No. Is it good value? At £6.50 for the cockle dish and £9.50 for the spider crab, yes. Of course, it’s achingly Shoreditch and so staunchly Now, which is enough to put most people’s backs up. But all that fashion blather doesn’t change a thing. The food at Brat is both seemingly effortless and utterly lovely. Jay’s news bites On a quick trip to Paris I stumbled on the brilliant Semilla on the Left Bank’s Rue de Seine, an airy space with a light menu which at lunchtime breaks down to a non-meat, fish and meat choice at €40 (£35)for three courses. It might be a lightly dressed tartar of bream to start, followed by slow-cooked belly pork, and a mandarin sorbet with meringue to finish (semillaparis.com). A company called Tile Acoustics, which normally installs noise-reducing acoustic panels in offices, has just been employed by Aldo’s, an Italian restaurant in Bradford. The new ceiling tiles, designed to match the restaurant’s décor, have apparently reduced noise reverberation by over 50%. Could other hard-surfaced restaurants please take note (tileacoustics.co.uk). An (admittedly small) study by the umbrella organisation Champions 12.3 has found that hotels which invest in food waste reduction measures are saving £7 for every £1 spent on the process, and 95% recoup their entire investment within two years (champions123.org).

Snacks and small plates £3.50-£11; large plates £12-£22; seafood tower £40; desserts £6; wines from £25 In the movies that carry her name, the fictional Bridget Jones lives a short, tear-stained, snot-smeared stumble from the real location of Bob’s Lobster, tucked into one of the spaces beneath the newly renovated London Bridge station. It’s a tidy fit because this would be exactly the kind of place Bridget would want to visit to eat away the pain of a calamitous break-up. In particular, she should order the fries with mussel and bacon chowder, because they will make everything better. I say “with” the chowder, because that’s how the menu describes it; “submerged in” is closer to the mark. Behold: a deep, soothing bowl of a wine and cream-based chowder, bobbing with Ford Cortina-orange mussels, into which has been dumped a whole serving of rather good chips. Pile a few more pert mussels on top, along with a bacon crumb and finely diced green herbs and spring onions to make it look like all the vital food groups have been covered, and there you have it: solace in a bowl. It’s a pescatarian take on Lancashire’s classic chips and gravy. The ones on the top are crisp; the ones beneath are a yielding soggy mess of cream and seafood and potato and profundity. Lean over and shovel it in, until your cheeks are slicked with soup and the bad thoughts have gone away. It’s an outrageous and joyous menu item – the word “dish” might be pushing it – which sums up the full-frontal assault of the food here. The cooking laughs in the face of the mostly American dishes it names on the menu. The succotash isn’t quite a succotash; the shrimp and grits would make a native of the state of Georgia frown. None of that matters, because most of it is very good. It’s called Bob’s Lobster because it grew out of the initials of Bedales of Borough, the wine bar back near the market (which, as it happens, occupies the site of what was the Greek restaurant in the original Bridget Jones movie). It helps that the founder is called Roberto Dann; there’s a bona fide Bob involved. Dann was looking to diversify from their wine and small plates offering, so he imported a vintage red-and-white VW camper van and started flogging lobster rolls out of it at Borough Market. The polished camper van now sits in the high-ceilinged space they’ve taken over in the red-brick undercarriage of London Bridge station. It’s just opposite the Vinegar Yard street food market that opened a couple of months ago. What was, until very recently, a deserted and scuffed Bermondsey drag is now, on a warm Thursday evening, full of bustle and shout and the merry clink of glass on glass. Here at Bob’s there’s a bar knocking out foaming pisco sours. They have an oyster happy hour late every Monday to Friday afternoon with bivalves at a quid each. For £8 they will make you a fishfinger sandwich, or fried chicken with anchovy salsa verde, while £40 gets you a “seafood tower” of oysters and prawns, salmon tartare, scallops and tuna tostada. For an extra £20 they’ll chuck the lobster tail on, too. We start with tuna tacos, which arrive tucked into a deep groove chiselled down a polished plank of wood, so it looks like a taco luge. It’s a significant amount of engineering to keep these elegant pockets of sashimi-grade tuna, wasabi-boosted guacamole, chipotle-flavoured cream and deep-fried wonton shells fully contained. There are four of them for £9. Each one is three or four satisfying mouthfuls of quality raw fish, acidity, crunch and spice. Unlike the chowder-splashed fries, eating these feels like an act of virtue. As does the succotash, which should probably come inside inverted commas. It keeps to the essentials, being a mixture of sweetcorn and podded broad beans. The addition of courgettes, fresh mint and, in particular, crumbled feta, leads it off towards the southern Mediterranean rather than the southern US. More familiar is the lobster and crayfish roll in a soft, sweet and toasted brioche bun: a bit of claw meat, a lot of crayfish (to keep the price below £20), a bed of crunchy coleslaw and all is right with the world. Shrimp and grits includes both those things: a large portion of big, shell-on shrimps and a sticky puddle of ground cornmeal grits, shown a good time in the open kitchen. The thick, gooey cornmeal has been spiked with jalapeños and bacon (if in doubt, add bacon. As we know, this is a fine code by which to live.) The prawns have been sautéed and the pan deglazed with bourbon. The boozy, buttery mess has then been poured all over the dish. It’s not subtle, but it is good. Only the lobster bisque doesn’t quite work and that, I think, is because it cleaves too closely to old-school New Orleans cooking. In Louisiana they’ll tell you theirs is the only truly classical culinary tradition in the US. Partly this is because they use lots of fancy French words. Menus are splattered with things like “boudin” and “beignet”; it sounds classier than sausages and doughnuts. Meanwhile, classic recipes for gumbos and étouffées have at their base a sauce aggressively thickened with flour. The lobster bisque here is one of those flour-thickened sauces, trying to pass itself off as something rather better-heeled. It’s generous on the lobster and I’ll never pass up a deep-fried crouton, but the soup is just a whisper off setting into a jelly. Oh well. Find relief in a dark, gooey chocolate brownie topped with a whorl of thick cream, made happy by the application of children’s party sprinkles. Any leftover brioche buns from today’s stock for lobster rolls will turn up here, in tomorrow’s bread and butter pudding. It’s studded with sultanas and bathed in vanilla custard. If this all feels a little heavy, do as we did and mark this moment by ordering the pisco sours. Or perhaps, don’t. None of this is subtle. None of this is poised. But it’s big on flavours and it’s huge on joy. All of it is overseen by a young staff who appear to give a damn. For most of the time Bob’s Lobster is a very appealing restaurant. But when emotional times are hard, and nice things are needed, I think it can also become something else. I think it can serve as a vital emergency service. News bites For another take on the food of the American south try Plaquemine Lock, a pub in London’s Islington specialising in Cajun and Creole cooking, from Jacob Kenedy of the Italian restaurant Bocca di Lupo. Many of the classics are here, from Cajun cracklins through shrimp with grits to fried green tomatoes and Jambalaya, all at reasonable prices. It is a labour of love by Kenedy, who has family from Louisiana (plaqlock.com). The onward march of great pie continues. Piecaramba, the vintage comic shop and pie wranglers who started in Winchester, are opening their third outlet in Brighton’s South Lanes. The names are as punning as ever – the Woolverine for a lamb and redcurrant jelly pie, the Chick Norris, for a chicken in curry sauce number – but they’re always good and cheerily priced, plus there are extensive non-meat options (piecaramba.co.uk) The team behind Franco Manca, the sourdough pizza company which started in Brixton market in 2008 and now has dozens of outlets across the UK, is to launch a pasta restaurant. Strozzapreti will be part of the 26-strong trader line-up at the food-based Seven Dials Market, inside the 19th Century Thomas Neal’s Warehouse in London’s Covent Garden.

Meal for two, including drinks and service: £120 plus. We should probably deal with the whole “butter on a rock” thing first. Being sophisticated souls, we laugh in the face of anything that isn’t a plate, don’t we? Or as my youngest once put it: “You start with a mini chip pan fryer and before you know it, there’s couscous in a mini wheelbarrow.” Well quite. But using a polished rock for the butter – exceptional chive butter, the colour of a bowls lawn, dressed with Lilliputian deep-fried onion rings and nasturtium blooms – is a tidy declaration of intent. Kevin Tickle’s cooking at Forest Side, a small country house hotel shoved into the lee of a hill just outside Grasmere, is an expression of the Cumbrian landscape. A shiny stone does the job nicely. You could argue that a genuine expression of the Cumbrian landscape at the arse end of winter would involve hosing you down with cold water, while directing an Arctic blast at your head, and simultaneously getting four shaggy, dung-crusted Herdwick to nuzzle you. Personally, I prefer the whole bourgeoise, “restaurant table in a warm room” version. The idea of food reflecting Cumbria is not a new one. Tickle, Cumbrian born and trained, spent eight years working with Simon Rogan at L’Enclume, which has more polished rocks for serving food on than you can shake a whittled elder stick at. The undulating, hobbit rooms of L’Enclume in Cartmel was a perfect setting for his games with botanicals and vegetables, both pristine and foetal. That said, I prefer Tickle’s version of it. L’Enclume is a parade of itsy bitsy tiny things. If you like something, it’s gone too quickly. Here at Forest Side, in an airy dining room with views out to the hills, it’s all just more robust. Don’t mistake. This is still a grown-up restaurant, with a slightly furrowed brow. The main tasting menu costs £80 and is at least seven courses long. I can’t pretend. I haven’t got as many years left as I’ve had, and I worry about losing them to seven-course tasting menus. Instead, we had the £35 menu but managed to negotiate a few substitutions, so as to work through more of the dishes. The upshot: they’re not keeping all the baubles and luxury ingredients back for the more expensive menu. The cheaper option has just as many fireworks. Both begin with the same canapés, which are dainty things in polished hobnail boots. One is a sweet-savoury cracker made by some alchemy from butternut squash. It is piled with crumbled black pudding, in turn topped with dinky splodges of funky brie-soft Tunworth cheese. It’s a flavour bomb. The other is a piece of toast topped with salt-cured egg yolk, wind-dried ham and black truffle. It is the best ham and eggs you will ever eat. Then the beads of chive-flavoured butter, with warm, open-crumbed seeded sourdough. Eventually we have to ask for the bread to be taken away. It is just too good. Then there’s a tiny, soft terrine of pig’s ear in an intense mushroom broth. It’s a textural game of tag, the slipperiness of the mushrooms echoing the slinkiness of the long cooked piggy lug hole. It’s a brilliant, potentially divisive dish and all the cleverer for that. There’s a lot of salt-baking going on here, to get the most of their vegetables, the majority of which come from their own kitchen garden tucked in behind the hotel. Celeriac is salt-baked until it tastes intensely of itself and served with plump mussels and two burnished fillets of lemon sole pressed together. In the other dish kohlrabi gets the salt-baked treatment, as a supporting act to pearlescent flakes of salt cod, with pickled nasturtium flowers and a lovage emulsion, providing just the edge of bitterness. This is precise, finely calibrated stuff. It stops you, makes you pause and stare for a moment. Or it does, if you are one of those people capable of rooting their emotional wellbeing in their lunch, which I am. There is the same intensity to the main courses. Pork loin comes with a pleasing ribbon of crisped fat, on bashed Jerusalem artichokes, with a deep, limpid pork jus dotted with puddles of herb oil. More diverting still is a piece of aged beef rib, served on a smoked butter emulsion. There are other things, too, of course. There are hen-of-the-wood mushrooms, and heaps of deep orange smoked squash. But what stays with me is the flavour of that beef, as though it has been hanging out by a winter bonfire, intensifying its own flavour, and gathering the tang of wood smoke on the cool late winter air. I want to rave all the way unto dessert, but I can’t, not quite. It’s not that they aren’t clever. They really are. But the intellectual, precise approach obvious in the savoury courses doesn’t fully transfer to the sweet end of the meal, where you need lusciousness and indulgence. Curls of dehydrated, caramelised apple are a wonder. The buttermilk custard and the lovage ice cream beneath them are very pleasing. Likewise, the tiny tuft of apple cake alongside them all. But it comes and goes without quite caressing the sweet spot. The same applies to a disk of pear laid with a woodruff ice cream and a granita and crumble. It is Tinker Bell delicate, a whiff of sugar rather than a full dive into the cookie jar. At the end, with our coffee, we are presented with a box of pebbles, two of which are misshapen pieces of botanical-infused ice cream in a grey chocolate shell. They are interesting rather than lovely, and at this point I wanted something lovely, even crowd-pleasingly blunt. A little loosening of the corsets is in order. It’s a criticism, but one which takes both Tickle and Forest Side seriously, which is how they wish to be taken; the bill, helped by a less than cheap and cheerful wine list, will reflect that seriousness. It is an exceptionally good hotel restaurant and is, I think, just a function of how much is going on in the Lakes and Cumbria right now. That evening I present the Cumbria Life food and drink awards at Kendal College, home to one of the most influential cooking courses in the country. It’s striking that many of the nominees are already national names. It’s also striking that, against very tough competition. Kevin Tickle is named chef of the year. Quite right, too. Jay’s news bites Also among the nominees for the Cumbria Life awards was the Drunken Duck Inn at Ambleside, an old pub up a Lake District hill whose current menu includes treacle-glazed ox cheek with padrón peppers, spiced lamb shoulder with pearl barley and, to finish, a chocolate and Kendal mint cake sundae. Come mid-afternoon and they’ll serve you a bowl of gumbo (drunkenduckinn.co.uk). Meanwhile in Edinburgh Michel Roux Sr and his son Alain Roux are launching a new £3m restaurant at the Balmoral Hotel. The as-yet-unnamed venture, due to open in May, will seat over 200 and specialise in French classics “using Scottish ingredients”. Mais bien sûr. Back in the capital, Mark Sargeant, who made his name with Gordon Ramsay, is to open a new venture at the Tower of London called – wait for it – Sargeant’s Mess. The restaurant, operated with food service group CH&amp;Co, will serve Atlantic cod with dripping chips, pressed shoulder of lamb and a selection of soups and salads to take away.

Meal for two, including drinks and service, £30-£70 I have located the focaccia of the gods; the loaf of the Italian, high gluten, olive oil-enriched bread against which all others must now be judged. It’s at Alchemilla in Glasgow. You will thank me for this information. Earlier this year I interviewed Francisco Migoya, co-author of the monumental six-volume work Modernist Bread. Migoya told me that focaccia had been one of the hardest loaves to get right. “It has a particular crumb structure,” he told me. He should book a flight from Seattle to Scotland immediately. He won’t be sorry. The focaccia at Alchemilla is light but springy. The crumb has the pleasing elasticity of a hot toasted crumpet. The crust somehow manages to be both crisp and chewy. It is salty, but not in a way that has you reaching for the water. It is so satisfying, such a profound pleasure, that I had to use every last ounce of my insipid willpower to decline seconds. I know this is the smart thing to do, because I immediately think of this bread as the pilot fish for the monster of a meal heading my way. If the kitchen can be bothered to fret over something so simple as this bread, surely the rest of their cooking is worth leaving space for. It is. Alchemilla, the scientific name for the plant Lady’s Mantle, is on Argyle Street, in Finnieston where Glasgow’s intriguing independent bistros gather in flocks. If you’re in the city and don’t know where to eat, go to this stretch of Argyle Street and window shop the menus. If you can’t find something you want to eat, it’s entirely your fault, not theirs. This one is very much Argyle Street cool. The double-height back wall of the open kitchen is a huge cliff of the city’s hefty brick, whitewashed. There’s a lot of laminate wood, and a fierce outbreak of orange along the bar. There are high ceilings, tattoos and a beard or two. Music plays and it could be a nightmare of clatter, but there’s a clever space beneath the stairs if you are old, like me, and want to escape the noise. What matters is the food, which is a thoughtful mix of great ideas and ingredients which are never overworked. The head chef is Rosie Healey, who trained with Yotam Ottolenghi. This may explain why it is vegetables which lead. It’s also exceptionally good value with most of the plates priced at between £6 and £9 and only entering the low teens for large-scale meat or fish. Better still, at lunchtime there’s a “two dishes for £10” deal. How about kohlrabi, fennel and herb paired with cauliflower and zhoug (a spiced Yemeni herb sauce), or chicory, anchovy and egg? They are dish titles which conspire to make you feel good about yourself just by reading them. We begin with that roasted cauliflower dish, the florets first caramelised and singed, then dressed with the Yemeni herb sauce before being sprinkled with the salty hit of black olives and the sweet-soft of raisins. It’s a multidimensional plate of food. Long, glossy quarters of hispi cabbage are cooked down in butter to soft and dressed with a salsa verde, punchy with salted anchovies. To banish the memory of the violated globe artichoke at the Farm Girl Café a few weeks back, I order it here and it is the time machine it should be. It takes me back to my old mum’s grown-up dinner parties in the late 70s, when this was her go-to starter: the thistle properly trimmed top and bottom and simmered in a little acidulated water, a big generous dish of thickly emulsified vinaigrette for dipping, a little pile of salt on the side if you fancy a quick dredge. It is one of food’s great, consuming pleasures. Pull off leaves, dip in dressing, drag over teeth. Ask for an extra napkin. From the short list of fish dishes, a smoked haddock carpaccio is ribbons of the same, lightly cured in an acidic dressing, with knots and tangles of roasted and pickled red peppers. The only meat dish we try is onglet, that determined steak cut which makes up for a lack of tenderness with flavour. It is paired with pickled clams and I choose it because it sounds a little weird. But the moment I try it I’m reminded of a dish of onglet with pickled walnuts. The ripeness of the beef and the acidity of the clams dance happily. Across the top are thick leaves of spinach, wilting in the warmth. What’s striking is the way the beef has been properly rested before reaching us. As a result, when we clear the plate, a glorious broth of juices and dressing has pooled. It takes a staggering effort not to pick up the plate and drain it straight into my mouth. This food isn’t intricate or precise. It is not made to be photographed. It is designed to be fabulous to eat. It is the product of extremely good taste. It is hugely satisfying. More to the point, even if the bread hadn’t done the job, any one of those dishes would have convinced me I was in very safe hands. From the short dessert menu there is a lemon tart, with thin, darkly baked and crisp pastry, and a filling that is only just set. Some might want a little more acidity but the dollop of crème fraîche on the side helps. What’s more, it comes in handy with the flourless chocolate and walnut cake, with a dark chocolate sauce. This is an adult take on chocolate cake. It’s a cake that’s sat in a wingback chair at debauched parties seeing things a cake should never have to see. One squidgy spoonful and it seems to suck the very light out of the room. My heart flutters. It is intense and serious, like it’s read loads of Proust and understood too much of it. I try a spoonful of the lemon tart with the cake and all of a sudden both plates are empty. We drink little save for a glass of a crisp Valencian cava full of fresh apple and apricot notes. I mention this because the wine list here is entirely “natural”. I won’t bang on about the subject because it now bores me as much as it does every one else, I’m sure. Save to say there are only good and bad wines and that this cava is one of the good ones. But then at Alchemilla everything is seriously good. It comes with the territory. News bites During my week-long trip to Scotland I was sustained by the Little Bakery in Queensferry just outside Edinburgh. Their huge, bulging scones with cream and jam are truly magnificent. The glass-fronted counter groans with cakes, clearly made by someone who has never heard the words ‘enough already’, and they do a very strong line in bacon bagels and soups. In short, it’s the perfect hangover cure (littlebakery.co.uk). Another bit of Edinburgh news. The brilliant Italian deli-cum-café Valvona and Crolla has introduced a new wine-pricing policy. During their weekend evening service you can buy any of the wines in the shop and drink them in the restaurant for just £4 corkage (valvonacrolla.co.uk). More cake news. Patisserie Valerie continues to post startling results. Six-month revenues were up over 9% to £60.5m with pre-tax profits up 14.2% to £11.1m. As a result, they’ve been able to fund the opening of another 10 sites purely from cash flow. They now have 206 stores.

Meal for two, including drinks and service £60-£120 I have eaten my lunch in toilets. This is not scatological hyperbole. There are a bunch of gentlemen’s conveniences that have been upcycled into bars and cafés, where you might sit with your knees in the now-polished urinals, blowing the froth off a flat white while clutching a soft bap. Restaurants have been opened in old power stations and butcher’s shops; in churches that God obligingly has moved out of to make space for the Josper grill, and in enough shipping containers to fill a Maersk liner. You’d think we’d be used to it by now, this post-high-street hospitality, but we’re not. The concept of the restaurant – what it should look like, the kind of space it should occupy, the way it should feel – is extraordinarily robust. Those intriguing repurposed spaces remain the minority among restaurateurs and the authorities who license them. The result is our stubbornly identikit high streets offering endless, will-sapping permutations of Byron-Côte-Wagamama-Zizzi-Jamie’s-Italian-Burger. And it’s self-fuelling. Each time such a space becomes available, the “cookie cutter” chains pile in, offering landlords the impression of security, even in these days of multiple branch closures. In turn, those landlords appear to assume that if it’s tough for the chains, with their economies of scale, and their brutal ways of wringing every last penny of profit margin out of the garlic bread, how much harder must it be for the independent operators diverting from the mainstream? Give thanks then for the enlightened licensing officers who have enabled Forza Win to flourish in their knackered warehouse on a south London industrial estate. Here, in Peckham, the walls are not so much distressed as ready for an intense course of cognitive behavioural therapy or perhaps just a hug. If you love ducting, corrugation and slab concrete, this is the place for you. You are unlikely to walk in off the street. You’ll only come here because you were intending to. You really should. Until last October, Forza Win was a ramshackle “let’s put the show on right here in the barn” affair, shaped for its space: you bought tickets in advance. You sat at communal tables and ate from an Italian-accented set menu. I went once, on a cold winter’s night, when it felt like the only warmth was from the encouraging food. Halfway through dinner, a server dropped a carving knife down my back as if subconsciously they wanted to stab me, which is unimaginable. Who in the restaurant business would wish me harm? Now they have fitted an open kitchen, some shiny tables rather than the creaky splintered ones they used to have and instituted a classic Italian menu. It operates as a standard restaurant and is run by delightful staff who would never try to stab a restaurant critic in the back. Three of us visit on a hot Sunday lunchtime, when fans are beating the warm air about the vault, and the space is filled with rattling, happy chatter and the clatter of plates. We drink glasses of a long, sour lemon punch and grin at the single sheet of paper in our hands. There are half a dozen antipasti, three pasta dishes and four mains. What’s most striking is the sheer quality of the ingredients: the taut-skinned and buxom, sweet beef tomatoes in a panzanella salad, the original home for leftovers. They leak sweet juices over your lips and into the golden-brown croutons of fried bread and across huge, breathy basil leaves that are so fragrant they’re practically narcotic. Yours for £8. For an extra quid they’ll throw on salted anchovies and capers, and if you wouldn’t pay up, we’ll never understand each other. There are firm borlotti beans with cherry tomatoes, rings of red onion and flakes of the best kind of tinned tuna. For those who think these dishes sound just a little too careful and refreshing, there’s the utter abandonment and filth of a fried cheese sandwich, made with thick-cut soft white bread and a mellow cheese that falls in strings down your chin. On the side, there are curls of pickled fennel in an attempt to pretend this plateful might be good for you and a thick, sweet chilli sauce to dip it all into if the mood strikes, which it does. It’s the sort of thing you could imagine eating in bed after midnight, drunk, because you’re an adult and can do these things. Robust tubes of rigatoni are listed as coming with lamb and celery. The two ingredients have clearly spent a long time in each other’s company, until they know not where one ends and the other begins. It is a butch ragu that demands to be chased around the bowl with every last piece of parmesan-draped pasta. For the mains, there is a grilled pork collar steak, served slightly pink, alongside a dollop of braised lentils and a muscular salad of flat-leaf parsley and mint. But the star is a whole spatchcocked chicken for £35. It has been half boned out, then grilled with a generous squirt of lemon juice. The skin is crisp and slightly sticky, the meat soft. It comes with a deep, wintery bowl of chick peas and chard, and deep-fried Jersey Royals, bursting from their skins in ragged, golden blooms. It is one of those meals that leaves you mouthing platitudes about the simple things done well. But that’s what this is: the good stuff to which better things have happened. The closest they get to innovation is a slice of melon, still on the rind, dressed with peppery olive oil and a few crystals of salt against its brim-full sweetness. It didn’t send me home thinking olive oil and salt are exactly what my melon needs in future, but it was fun. A light-textured milk chocolate pot came with a dollop of thick caramel at the bottom and I’m never going to say no to that. We did not drink; it was too hot. But there is a short, well-priced, entirely Italian wine list. After, we wander the vintage market that occupies the rest of this fractured red-brick estate, resisting the temptation to buy bits of cheap 60s furniture we don’t need, and marvel at the way inner-city spaces such as this can become places that people want to go to. In some ways, Forza Win, with its excellent menu of Italian classics, is following a safe course; but in many other ways it’s an exceptionally brave venture indeed. We need much more of this, if we are to vanquish the bland. News bites Hill &amp; Szrok on Broadway Market in Hackney, east London, is another restaurant in an unlikely environment. By day it’s a butcher’s shop. By night, they cook the meat they were selling earlier. Come for veal tartare with anchovy, pork rillette with pickles or a very simple list of grilled cuts from a pork chop for a tenner, through to an 850g côte de boeuf (hillandszrok.co.uk). BBC2 has commissioned a second series of Million Pound Menu, the business show that saw restaurant hopefuls competing for the investment needed to open the establishment of their dreams. If you have a restaurant idea – perhaps you’re a street-food operator looking to settle down – they want to hear from you. Applications must be in by 17 August (millionpoundmenu.com). Sacha Lord, Manchester’s newly appointed ‘night tsar’, is holding a consultation on 2 August, looking at experiences of tipping and service charges. Lord says he’s responding to reports of poor practices. The event will be at the Deaf Institute on Grosvenor Street.

Meal for two including drinks and service £90. It doesn’t matter how much titivation and knocking through they do to an old boozer to turn it gastro. If once you knew where the bogs were, you always know. The toilets never move. I could find my way to the facilities at the Coach and Horses in London’s Farringdon with my eyes shut and a few years back I basically did, many times. There’s a reason they call it “blind drunk”. Now renamed the Coach, the pub sits in a hollow between the Clerkenwell and Farringdon Roads which, according to legend, was the place for bear baiting in Victorian London. Apparently, the bears were kept in the cellar until the landlord slipped on his ladder and rightly became lunch. I knew the Coach in a more debauched era, for it was behind what was the headquarters of the Guardian and the Observer. It was our pub. The landlord, Brian, would cash our cheques – such nostalgia – without a card. He knew our home addresses so we could be poured into a cab at the end of the night. The boss classes would regularly call down to the Coach looking for an errant reporter as deadline approached. The bar staff knew how to pick up the phone as you arrived to buy a pint, read your face and tell the caller that no, they hadn’t seen you. We celebrated promotions in there, and the end of the week, and the fact we’d got through, say, Wednesday without incident. It was very utilitarian, the Coach. Those toilets stank. We left that building almost 10 years ago. We had no reason to stay, because the old boozer had been stripped and sanded and had started serving food which by all accounts was rather edible. Twiglets were not good enough for the new clientele, apparently. A number of colleagues blamed this on me, because I banged on about nice cooking and pleasing gastro pubs. It was only a matter of time before my filthy bourgeois contagion reached the Coach. Out of twisted solidarity, even I didn’t go in there again. Then a few months ago it reopened under the care and supervision of the chef Henry Harris, who has been brought on board to revive this and both the Hero of Maida (formerly the Truscott Arms in Maida Vale) and the Three Cranes, deeper into the City. I’d refer to Harris as the “veteran” chef, but he’d probably set fire to my hair. It is my way of admitting we are friends. I fell for his cooking first. When we met he had just finished a less than happy period at some pan-Asian lounge and was about to open Racine in Knightsbridge. I asked him what the plan was. He said: “to never cook with lemongrass ever again”. He kept his word. Racine became the place for people besotted with the eternal verities of French bistro cooking: for calves’ brains in black butter and rabbit in mustard sauce and Wiener Holstein and a perfectly made Mont Blanc, with crisp and chewy meringue and a chestnut purée like velvet. A few years ago, Harris closed Racine. He said the neighbourhood it had been designed to serve was now a desert of empty properties bought for investment. A portion of London, the lard-arsed portion, mourned. Harris’s reappearance overseeing these pubs was taken as a cause for celebration. So I’m declaring an interest. Just know that if I couldn’t have been positive, I wouldn’t have reviewed. If this troubles you, stop reading now. Another review will be along next week. The menu at the Coach is like greeting a much-missed old friend. This is not food that pushes at boundaries; it is very happy keeping to its own agenda. There is now a glass-ceilinged extension and a patio out back which, on a warm day, is filled with middle-aged men eating together. For a particular sort of bloke, Harris’s French classics are like nursery food, a list of things that says everything will be fine. Those calves’ brains are listed, though today haven’t yet arrived from France. I regard it only as a reason to return. Instead, I have steak tartare which, rather than being compressed into a dense, puckered cylinder, is a loose mound of mustardy loveliness, cut through with capers and cornichon. The toast is thick cut and warm. A skate terrine with a basil and tomato sauce is a plateful designed for an early summer’s day, the block of sweet, mellow white fish breaking apart easily for a ride through the sweet-sour herb dressing. I have the grilled rabbit with planks of crisp, smoked bacon and a thick mustard sauce because it’s been a while since we hung out together. It’s not a complicated plate of food, but it is extremely satisfying. Duck confit comes with a bacon sauce and pommes sarladaise, the potatoes sliced, pressed, baked, then cut into squares and deep fried because that makes most things better. Prices are London familiar: about £8 for starters, mid-teens for mains, £80 gets you a whacking côte de boeuf for two with chips, salad and peppercorn sauce. For dessert there are the likes of crème caramel or chocolate and almond torte. Instead, we share an apple and ginger crumble which, encouragingly, comes with both ice cream and custard, because why should we be forced to choose? In the interests of balance, it should be recorded that this was listed as an apple and ginger crumble, but of ginger nothing could be detected. For God’s sake, Harris, get your act together. The wine list is a robust, French-heavy collection, starting at less than £20 a bottle – greetings PicPoul de Pinet; why hello Sancerre – and priced to enable the losing of a night without losing your home. It should also be said that, before you get to the atrium and the patio, and the metrosexual men with their Gallic comfort food, this is still a pub, serving the product of breweries like Timothy Taylor, Thornbridge, Portobello and Stiegl. And even on this warm day there are a few chaps here, nursing a pint. Listen very carefully and I swear you can hear the ghosts of my colleagues at their shoulder, whispering gently: just have another; stay a while; of course you’ll get your copy in on time because you always do. The new Coach is a very different place to the one I knew. It’s changed in so many ways. But it’s also very welcome. News bites For pub food with an Anglo-French accent, head to the Cartford Inn at Little Eccleston in Lancashire. Amid the starters, a classic French onion soup sits comfortably next to black pudding doughnuts. Dishes from the ‘Pub Classics’ menu include an oxtail and beef skirt suet pudding and a fish pie, but they’ll also do you a côte de boeuf or a fruits de mer (thecartfordinn.co.uk). My latest piggy crush: dry-cure bacon from Cure and Simple, a small outfit bringing a nerdy approach to the serious business of the rasher, and then dispatching it via a subscription service for £4.95 a pack. My favourite is the oak-smoked pancetta-style back bacon… It’s why the bacon sandwich was invented (cureandsimple.com). Congrats to restaurant crowdfunding king Gary Usher, the chef behind Sticky Walnut and Burnt Truffle in the north-west.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(519,'2018-10-12T09:00:26Z','The Pointer, Brill, Buck: ''If this is the future of hospitality, count me out’ – restaurant review','Until recently, a “mini-break” spent in a “hotel” was the answer to many of life’s woes: exhaustion, ennui, existential dismay. Nowadays, modern types favour the “restaurant with rooms” – the new buzz term for dinner with an overnight stay. Plain, snoozy, old, functional hotels, with an abundance of staff, room service, reception desk, trouser presses, tear-stained Gideon bibles and a terrine of wobbly breakfast buffet sausages, are over. They’re also massively expensive to run. “But I liked the congealed scrambled eggs, and housekeeping trying to clean my room,” you might say. Tough titty, the hospitality world replies. The Pointer at Brill is one of these places: somewhere to eat, then rest your head. It’s a gorgeously restored country pub with a separate building over the road with four tasteful, country-chic, modern rooms in muted shades with exposed beams. The pub has a ye olde worlde butcher’s shop attached to it, selling its own bespoke charcuterie, and even a quaint delivery van outside. The Pointer is very much part of the future of British hospitality. One checks in by shouting one’s arrival across a crowded bar. “This Pointer Farm charcuterie board,” I say as we begin dinner, pointing at the menu, “there are five meats on it, but could we possibly just order some of the longhorn beef cured in red wine and the venison salami?” The waiter blanches. “I mean,” I say rapidly, “obviously we’ll pay for those things. It’s just that we don’t want the other salami or the potted pork.” It’s not an enormous ask. We are the only overnight guests. We are eating at 8pm. We are their final table. I can hear the under-occupied chefs chatting. Our server disappears, anxiously. “No,” he says on his return, “you’ll need to buy the entire board, because it’s already portioned up.” Ah, the tyranny of the rural pub chef. I have grown to know it so well. These men – always men – who have been told via rosettes and regional prizes that they are so brilliant and indispensable. Chef, in this case, cannot possibly plate up and flog some slices of their prized venison salami. I laugh, because sometimes that’s all you can do. The rest of our order includes roast grouse for £38 and pan-fried hake for £24, which are punchy prices by Mayfair standards. We are seated in the main pub area, in the window overlooking the road. During my starter – two sardines, reportedly infused with elderflower, served with an invisible salsa – a massive lorry with an enormous excavator pulls up outside. “Thames Water seem to be digging a massive hole in the road,” I say. “How late can they possibly do that until? It’s already 9.30 now.” As the banging and drilling begins, it feels clear that, at this restaurant with rooms, no one particularly is in charge of our stay. Confit salmon arrives with a pleasant, albeit sweet horseradish sorbet. The grouse is clearly an excellent piece of game, but is rather overdone. My hake, decently judged in its cooking, arrives on dry, unseasoned “fricassee of potatoes”. An extra side of “farmhouse potatoes” turns out to be a bowl of apparently semi-raw new potatoes. To serve them in this state seems almost surreal. “These aren’t cooked,” I say, pointing at spuds so raw, you could dislodge an enemy’s wig with one. “Oh,” the server says before whisking them back to the chef. No further comment is made and they appear on the bill for £4. Pudding is a deconstructed bakewell tart, which adds up to less than the sum of its parts. After the restaurant, we retire to our room. It’s an unforgettable night. The earth moves for us, quite literally, until 5am. At daybreak, over breakfast and piped Alanis Morissette, I tackle the person setting out the pretty bircher muesli about the night-time chaos, but she claims no knowledge of the incident. She then presents me with a £245 bill for food and board, and by now I’m suspicious that I’m being filmed for a gotcha-style TV hidden camera prank set up by that cad Jay Rayner. It’s the only explanation. We pack up and hand back the room key, interrupting a staff meeting. The team were possibly puzzling over how to get the word out nationally about their charcuterie and exemplary customer service. We drive to an actual hotel, have some sleep and order a caesar salad with chips on room service. I’ve never been so happy to see a Corby trouser press and UHT cartons in my life. It may feel sometimes that the British hotel scene is broken, but I’m not certain I like how we’re fixing it. • The Pointer 27 Church Street, Brill, nr Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, 01844 238339.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(528,'2023-04-16T05:00:02Z','The Kolossi/Attica, London: ‘It’s not revelatory, it’s much better than that’ – restaurant review','The Kolossi/Attica, 50-60 Rosebery Avenue, London EC1R 4RR. Small plates, starters £3.80-£9.80, larger dishes £15.80-£21.50, desserts £7.50, wines from £27 Let’s pull back the velvet curtain on this restaurant reviewing lark. Because readers of the Observer and our daily sibling, the Guardian, would be unimpressed if both myself and the saintly Grace Dent reviewed the same restaurants, we quietly co-ordinate what we are going to write about. I let a Guardian colleague know where I’m planning to go and they return the compliment. Mostly these emails contain just the name of a restaurant from one side and a reply with the single word “yours” from the other. When I emailed to say I was planning to review the Kolossi grill on Rosebery Avenue in London’s Clerkenwell, my famously lugubrious colleague’s response was the word “blimey” followed by a sentence questioning the sanity of everyone involved. I understood why. The Kolossi first opened in 1966, a short stumble from what in 1976 became the Guardian and later the Observer’s home, until 2008. It has a kitsch Palladian frontage, as if it were a Poundland offshoot of the Acropolis. It would be unfair to say it was actively bad. It was part of a generation of mostly Greek Cypriot restaurants scattered across the UK that offered a narrow, reliably robust version of the Greek repertoire. For the newspapers’ staff, however, the Kolossi’s greatest virtue was simply that it was there. You went there after the pub, guided by instinct. With the searing wit of headline writers everywhere, it was nicknamed the Colossal Bill, perhaps in celebration of its cheapness. Or it was called something else, which was hilariously funny in 1992 and really isn’t now. Back then the walls were panelled in orange-varnished wood. There was plastic ivy dangling from the beamed ceiling and, on occasion, a belly dancer. A paid one, not a subeditor who had got carried away, two bottles of caustic retsina to the bad. Although that might have happened. It could all get very messy. The lovely staff were forgiving. So no, not an obvious candidate for the once over. But then I learned that the owners these past 34 years had moved on. The lease had been taken over by a businessman named David Lonsdale, who is involved with the nearby Sekforde. He had restored that Georgian pub to its former glory. Now he was doing the same with the Kolossi. I checked out the menu, which used to be long. It is now short and to the point and rather attractive. So here I am once more, clambering out of a cab at the scene of so many lost nights. The faux Palladian façade is still in place, but it has been repainted from a light olive green to a deep Aegean blue. And hang on. What’s this? The name seems to have changed. It is now called Attica, presumably after the Greek peninsula. Although at the time of writing it’s still called the Kolossi on its website and elsewhere online. We’re modern. We can handle this two names thing. Inside, the wood panelling has been stripped and repainted in shades of cream. The plastic ivy on the ceiling has been replaced by a fairy-lit canopy of twigs. The paper tablecloths have gone. It’s now all solid marble. But it’s still that room. It’s still that place where I remember putting the world to rights and filling up my glass again mid-anecdote, even though I knew I’d pay for it the next morning, and then filling the glass once more. I can still hear the echoes of when it operated as an unofficial club room for a bunch of people with a shared endeavour. In those spaces the quality of the cooking matters far less than the fact that you have all chosen to sit in it together. And then the food started to arrive and I knew we were somewhere else entirely. Once upon a time restaurants like the original Kolossi were the only place you’d find tarama and it would be bright pink and grainy and acidic. Now it’s become a part of menus in so many other ambitious restaurants, as a mark of good taste. The bar has been raised. This version, from the short list of dips with which the menu opens, is a match for any of them. It’s whipped and frothy and comes dressed with a shiny puddle of olive oil, lots of chopped dill and a single salty kalamata olive. The accompanying pitta is warm and soft and oil-slicked. There are deep-fried zucchini balls, creamy inside and crisp outside, with a coarse and garlicky tzatziki. There are three fat prawns “saganaki” – baked with olive oil, feta, oregano and the sweetest of cherry tomatoes now bursting from their skins. Hold back some of the pitta for mopping duties. The choice of larger dishes is concise: three seafood dishes, a few souvlaki and a couple of baked things, including moussaka. A skewer of lamb souvlaki brings salty, charred meat that has clearly been grilled at speed to save it from being ruined, with a rugged salad and a dish of a lemony tahini dressing. A fat fillet of seabass, its skin crisped, slouches louchely on a bed of nutty new potatoes with its own lemon-boosted sauce. Only a Cretan salad, made with hefty chunks of barley rusk, is a little heavy-going. It may well be exactly as it’s meant to be. In which case what it’s meant to be turns out to be a little heavy-going. This is not cooking that redefines the very notion of Greek food. It’s not revelatory. It’s so much better than that. It’s the essentials done with due care and attention. Service is run by one lovely bearded man from Athens, who doesn’t miss a beat and seems delighted to see his customers enjoying themselves. In the half-open kitchen, there’s one older chap, grilling the meats and dribbling the olive oil in all the right places. Desserts are syrup-drenched pastries with a scoop of mastic ice-cream, with that slightly bouncy, rubbery texture, familiar to anyone who has ever bought a cornet in the hottest of climes. We have a slab of soft, fragrant orange cake and another made with walnuts. The short, entirely Greek wine list, currently boasting just one retsina, helps it all on its way. The Kolossi Grill AKA Attica grill is that rare thing; a venerable restaurant that has found a way to avoid decline and start afresh. I used to know you very well, old friend. I look forward to getting to know you all over again. News bites Two restaurants, both very much enjoyed by this column, have announced they are closing, and both attribute the decision to rising costs and generally appalling trading conditions. In Worthing, MasterChef winner Kenny Tutt closes Bayside Social today, but will continue to focus on Pitch, his other restaurant in the town. Meanwhile in Ramsbottom, Levanter Fine Foods has now closed. However, its sister restaurant, the Basque-influenced Baratxuri, which recently relocated to Manchester city centre, is very much alive and well (baratxuri.co.uk). There’s money in pizza. Fulham Shore, the company that operates the Franco Manca chain as well as the Real Greek group, looks set to accept a cash takeover offer from a Japanese restaurant business called Toridoll Holdings. The offer values Fulham Shore at just shy of £95m and would benefit chairman and co-founder David Page to the tune of £11m. Franco Manca, which started with one site in Brixton market in 2008, now has just over 70 outlets across the UK (francomanca.co.uk). We started with news of closures so let’s finish with news of an opening. Josh and Victoria Overington, who closed their York restaurant Le Cochon Aveugle late last year, have announced the opening in June of Mýse, which is pronounced meez and comes from the Anglo Saxon for “eating at the table”.

Once upon a time, almost everywhere looked like this from about 7pm on Saturdays; sort of Hogarthian, but with a flavour of an episode of The Last of Us in which a full-scale riot, peppered by zombies, is crashed into by a flaming 747. Anyway, it’s safe to say that, on this particular evening, Birmingham’s revellers had started their sessions early. The queues outside The Botanist and Revolución de Cuba were already buoyant with hens in sashes and stags planning strategic chunders, while outside McDonald’s, one young woman wearily asked her friends: “Can’t we just, like, stop drinking, get a Maccy’s and go home?” A peal of cackles was their reply. The Oyster Club, on the other hand, which sits at the top of Temple Street, is altogether classier. It’s a posh seafood restaurant with a marble counter where you can eat Loch Ryan native oysters at £28 for six and omelette Arnold Bennett at £21.50. It’s a special-occasion place, with some lovely birthdays and anniversaries taking place on the night we went, but even they couldn’t drown out the noise from the “considerably richer than yous” sitting to both my right and left, and who were forensically detailing their properties, post-tax profits and jetsetting adventures at a volume so loud, it blew the sorrel off my rhubarb-dressed oysters. Should rhubarb go with oysters? I was keen to find out. Purists would say there’s no place even for shallot vinaigrette, because all that does is mask the lovely, salty, phlegmy mouthfeel of the oyster itself. Frankly, I think an oyster needs all the help it can get, even if the Oyster Club’s rhubarb was rather sweet and synthetic. I don’t know if chef Adam Stokes, of the Michelin-starred Adam’s on nearby Bennett’s Hill, was cooking that night at this, his second venture, but fritto misto should in theory be the ultimate guilty treat – a chance to pile into a heaving plate of glorious fresh fish, calamari, courgette and so on in a delicate batter and served with dipping mayo. This fritto misto, however, came on a small side plate that held one king prawn, one piece of unidentified white fish, a cremated langoustine and something CSI Snow Hill might have identified as whitebait; the largest thing on the plate was the chunk of lemon. A second small side plate then arrived with a saucer of ponzu dipping sauce on top of a large shiso leaf, alongside which I located five small pieces of salmon sashimi. That said, the omelette Arnold Bennett was utterly gorgeous: a runny, cheesy, bechamel-drenched, smoky, eggy cuddle in a small, elegant pan and with perfectly judged haddock. Service is sporadic, but fine: servers turn up with trays, bringing your orders, but without checking if you need anything else. We sat for ages without drinks – not even water – because the bartenders seemed far too busy making banana old fashioneds and espresso martinis to notice us poor old diners. We ordered the catch of the day to share, which raised an eyebrow from the waiter, though with no explanation as to why. The reason revealed itself later, when a hulking great brill arrived, finally at rest after a life spent bullying basking sharks off St Ives. It was cooked beautifully and came with a delightful, buttery sauce, and we were damned if we were wasting any, even if that meant we’d need pushing back to the car in a shopping trolley. There was some confusion, though, about how to fit this fish on the counter, which is something they should probably have worked out when designing this speciality fish restaurant. Alongside that, our sides were a small bowl of buttered spring greens and chunky chips that were nothing to write home about. The Oyster Club does some things exceedingly well and others in a lacklustre and at times unforgivable fashion that seems to be based on hoping that guests will either know no better, or simply be thrilled to be seen dining here. Oddly, my lemon tart dessert was wonderful and seemed homemade, although that may have just been deft staging, because someone had clearly given it a quick blast with a blowtorch shortly before it was served. Inland fish restaurants are peculiar places; the older I get, and the further I travel, the more I question why they exist at all. The best fish is eaten next to the water, in the sunshine, cooked simply, without grandeur and with perhaps a little paddle afterwards. Then there are the likes of the Oyster Club that are nowhere near the sea, very fancy and pricey, and where you’ll be fed but possibly ignored. Not waving, but drowning.

The city’s gravitational pull moved eastwards many moons ago, but in recent years this particular part of it has hit a nadir of skyscrapers, slick hotel openings and post-bottomless brunch screaming. However, wander down Leonard Street, and you’ll spot what seems to be a large orange acorn marking the Mexican restaurant, Zapote. It’s not an acorn, though; it’s a soft, fleshy, sweet fruit called a sapote which, very roughly speaking, looks like a peach mated with a beef tomato and tastes like sweet potato. The sapote is hugely popular from southern Mexico all the way to Nicaragua, and in some areas of south-east Asia, too, as well as in this new opening by chef Yahir Gonzalez, who himself hails from Aguascalientes in central Mexico. Zapote is co-founded by Tony Geary, an industry stalwart with long experience of running some of the more hectic of London’s dining establishments, among them Sketch, before overseeing the 20-restaurant roster of the Aqua group, which includes Hutong, Aqua Shard, Aqua Kyoto and so on. After spinning all those plates, Zapote must feel to Geary a bit more zen, because it is a large but serene space, with 65 covers in the dining area and a pretty, horseshoe bar that serves cocktails such as the Zapote 90, which is a feisty whirlwind of Casamigos tequila with Ojo de Dios Mezcal, orgeat and lemon. Drink a couple of those with a side of crisp pork skin (posh Mexican pork scratchings), dip it in the lovely, punchy pico de gallo and see if you care about life then. Eagle-eyed restaurant chasers may have noticed that Zapote’s address was, until recently, the fancy and trendy St Leonard’s, which burned bright and fast – until it didn’t. This new incarnation is both brighter and cosier, with an art deco-leaning collage of clashing, colourful wallpaper creating a backdrop against which to eat raw beef tacos with a side of wobbly roast bone marrow, or the beauty contest-winning roast red pepper and black bean tostada – a vibrant explosion of red almost too pretty to eat, but well worth the ensuing wilful destruction, because it zings with freshness. Vegetarians do well at Zapote, too. Coal-roasted sweet potato with smoky chipotle is cooked in embers until just so, before being festooned with chilli: this is thoughtful, meat-free cooking. The crisp baby artichokes are also very good, plus it makes sense to let someone else take the strain of cooking those little critters, especially when they serve them with a lush, green pipián sauce. And I last saw black-bean pozole in Las Vegas, when I helped a Mexican cook make about 50 litres of the stuff using a mechanical stirrer that was almost as big as me, but, happily, here at Zapote, the pozole is a much more refined affair, topped with picked white crab and served inside a crab shell. In fact, the menu is a deft mix of the recognisably Mexican as a Brit might view it and something altogether more classy. Yes, there are tacos, tostadas and tortillas, but this is also fine, thoughtful, worldly dining where refined slices of lamb neck, charred outside and pink within, turn up on a sleek bed of smoked aubergine flesh with tamarind puree. The accompanying tortilla, made with native Mexican corn, is served in a dainty, woven pochette, which one places beside a gaspingly beautiful, sea-green Portland Stone Ware side plate and thinks: “I’m not in the Chiquito on Leicester Square now, am I?” Certainly not with a fancy plate of sea bass aquachile that comes draped delicately with shaved fennel, dill and cucumber. Zapote is a date-night kind of place, or for dinner with a client you’d actually like to talk to. Service is diligent: you can have as much or as little info about what you order as you like, but if you require it, every detail comes with a back story, because this place is quite clearly a labour of love. It is a combination of Gonzalez’s memories of Mexican cuisine mixed with his ambitions for its future, all served in a setting that could be Greenwich Village and feels a million miles from the silent discos and prosecco pedal-bus experiences that Shoreditch now offers in profusion. Finish off dinner with one of their fearsome but delicious white-chocolate-topped doughnuts, which are dark, brooding and covered in a glorious, thick marmalade; or a delightful creme caramel made with coconut and topped with coriander and soft pineapple – though that is really just a few glorious spoonfuls, so should be treated as a post-pudding chaser. Zapote is a place to have up your sleeve whenever anyone mentions “going up Shoreditch”. Proceed straight to the bar and order a mezcal. This is not a drill. Zapote 70 Leonard Street, London EC2, 020-7613 5942. Open lunch Tues- Sat, noon-2.30pm; dinner Tues-Sat, 5.30-10pm (10.30pm Fri &amp; Sat).

Strong word of mouth is really as good as it gets when choosing where to eat out these days. There’s so much to quibble about right now: brief opening hours, wild prices, staffing issues, as well as a host of London openings so soulless and unwelcoming that their investors, possibly registered in the Cayman Islands for tax purposes, must be rather alarmed. So, when somewhere such as Khai Khai turns up, featuring a large scoop of Dishoom-style, broad-based likability, it’s genuinely exciting. There’s a large chunk of the familiar on offer here – lamb bhuna, biryani, vindaloo, rotis, kheema naan and so on – but there’s also a lot that will seem mysterious to some diners: kheema pav, say (minted spiced lamb mince and peas in bread), or beetroot shikampuri, which come stuffed with hung yoghurt. The breakfast menu, served from 9-11.30am, features masala mash with pooris (deep-fried bread with potato curry) and akuri toast (onion, tomato and ginger scrambled eggs). “It’s not food, it’s heritage,” it says on the menu. Gordon Ramsay, who popped into Khai Khai last year, was moved to visit the kitchen and praise the butter chicken (and it is very, very good) and the tandoori pineapple martinis. Harrison Ford, too, has eaten here while filming in the city, so perhaps Indiana Jones 5 will feature a scene in which Indy fights his way through the Bigg Market on a Saturday night, swatting away love bites from women wearing Ann Summers police costumes. After all, a night out in Newcastle – and I have had many since the 1980s – never lacks action. Large groups seem to like the place, as well – there were lots on the day I went. Khai Khai, its dark frontage obscured by a pot-plant jungle, is tucked away on Quayside, which is one of my favourite places in the UK to hide, because you’re close to the Tyne for a bracing walk, close to the Sage arena and, for a glutton like me, close to both House of Tides and Solstice, which are both deservedly Michelin-starred Kenny Atkinson restaurants (although my most recent trip to the latter felt more worthy of two stars). Experience has taught me that a night spent eating delicate, artful, gong-winning food often means that the likes of onion and samphire bhajis, plump achari tiger prawns and bowls of Kashmiri lamb rogan josh seem all the more enticing the following evening. Khai Khai’s shtick is the distinct smokiness of many of its dishes, which come out of a Josper oven fuelled by coal and wood. I felt a bit queasy about the term “smoke play” to describe this, however, because it sounds like a kink involving someone chugging their way through an entire packet of Rothmans Untipped, but I am now a huge fan of Khai Khai’s signature tandoori broccoli, which looks wildly charred, as if it had been chipped out of a crack in a Pompeii pavement, encrusted with chilli flakes and pistachio, and littered with microgreens. It turns out to be so wonderful that I spent the whole of the next day wondering how they did it. Liquid smoke and MSG? Specially sourced coals, mystery spices and a blowtorch? Broccoli should not be this delicious. There is a “chef’s feast” set-meal option for £39 a head that promises to be “worthy of the Last Supper”, which I suspect they think means varied, bounteous and delicious, rather than “eaten with friends who betray you before you get nailed to a big cross”. Regardless, we stuck to the à la carte and ranged across the menu, ordering a very good kale and sag paneer and a Purdah vegetable biryani livened up with jackfruit. The murgh tikka from the “smoke play” small plates section, meanwhile, is, again, puzzlingly incredible. It is just chicken breast cooked on a Josper, but the depth of charred flavour combined with the softness of the meat is really quite astounding. It’s the kind of food you pause halfway through eating so you can text friends about it. Old Delhi butter chicken is pretty much more of the same, though in its case it comes in a piquant, herby, smoky slick of greatness. The only disappointment, really, was Josper-smoked aubergine in a thin, pale pool of tamarind vinaigrette with some pomegranate kachumber and a few pine nuts, which gave the impression of a pavement puddle more than actual dinner. Then again, you can’t win them all. Plus there is rhubarb and carrot halwa on the dessert menu, as well as homemade gulab jamun milk dough dumplings with vanilla ice-cream. Khai Khai is friendly, absolutely jam-packed, open from breakfast until midnight and serves reliably good food without seeming to break a sweat. I, for one, am ready for the Khai Khai roll-out.

After all, life was making it jolly difficult to eat out at the time, and you were very possibly staring forlornly at an NHS Covid app and wondering if that ping meant another nine full days of baked bean Brevilles, or you had just given up on “the outdoors” altogether. But it was at that exact point that Hot 4 U was trying to make things happen in east London with a series of temporary engagements in pubs such as The Prince Arthur in Shoreditch and The Haggerston in E8, by serving up iced buns with Marmite butter, beef tartare with mulberry umeboshi, and ox tongue with seaweed and tzatziki. Then again, maybe you wouldn’t have gone to Hot 4 U regardless of the pandemic, because it just sounded a bit bloody much. And it really did: they did foie gras-wrapped Mini Magnums, chicken bicep with shichimi and an ever-changing wine list featuring the likes of Fleur Godart’s Male Tears 2020, part of the Cuvées Militantes series of wines taking a stance against sexism, racism and homophobia. In fact, for anyone older than 28, a quick shufti at Matthew Scott’s menu and Charlie Carr’s wine selection will probably provoke an “old man yells at cloud” reaction. Hot 4 U’s menu wording was chaotic, while the vibe was dreamy and a little revolutionary. It was as if these people had never heard of a nice, straightforward dinner, or an early night. There was also an esprit de Fergus Henderson about Hot 4 U, with its non-squeamishness and honesty about ingredients; even he, however, stopped far short of serving garum Pom-Bears or whisky bone-marrow luges. The dessert offering didn’t escape, either, with vodka watermelon and various nostalgic, custard-based dishes topped with hundreds and thousands. Cheese-and-pineapple porcupine has never featured on a Henderson menu, and, frankly, the St John experience has always been poorer for the omission. If you have read this far about Scott and Carr, and are now screaming “oh, grow up”, well, the good news is that they have – a bit – because Papi is a proper restaurant in London Fields, and its menu seems a little calmer, possibly because they don’t want to scare away passers-by, or possibly because they’ve tired themselves out with culinary obstreperousness. Or maybe it’s because Scott is such an accomplished cook that he’s past hiding his talent behind perceived wackiness. Papi’s small plates selection on the day we visited was certainly more sedate than those for which Hot 4 U became infamous, and it was all executed with great finesse. A monster of a steak tartare came bejewelled with capers and topped with an egg yolk, with some obscenely good, hot, very crunchy fries on the side. A wonderful slab of deftly cooked pollock was drenched in a sweet, buttery sauce, two delightfully hulking great doorsteps of soothing white milk loaf came with about 200g of cultured, sea salted butter that, in its soft, pacifying smoothness, was more than a little infantilising, and a plate of raw bream crudo turned up with wild garlic and a meaningful offering of caviar. If you go expecting chaotic cooking, loud music and an abundance of offal, you’ll be disappointed. Instead, Papi is genteel, serving a glorious salad of fancy tomatoes tangled among a wodge of oozing, breadcrumbed, deep-fried cheese, and a generous plate of Cecina De León, sliced rather thickly and served with juicy melon. There is a precision and earnestness to the cooking that is light years from the hip positioning and hype that surrounds this new venture, and nothing leaves the kitchen without cogitation – plates arrive as and when, mostly one at a time and often with ponderous gaps in between. So much so, in fact, that, as the place started filling up, including several larger tables, I began worrying whether these people would get any food at all, seeing as serving just the two of us from the very short menu had taken several hours. Still, it’s inarguable that this is cooking worth waiting for. Perhaps the trick is to settle in for the long haul, order a dozen cherry vinegar oysters, some of that lovely bread and a bottle of Meinklang Prosa sparkling rosé to set you up, then leave them to bring you lovely plates of spaghetti with clams and ’nduja and some freshly podded peas with goat’s curd whenever the mood takes them. There was one solitary dessert: poached rhubarb with crème anglaise, which was dotted with those jubilant, multicoloured sprinkles that were the highlights of every 1980s children’s birthday party. It seemed a small gesture to Papi’s zany reputation, albeit a subdued one in the context of a delicious meal from a young chef with a fascinating future. What a relief: enfants terribles are all very interesting, but I rarely want them to cook my dinner. Papi 1F Mentmore Terrace, London E8, 07961 911500.

Home in Dumfries offers a tasting menu with puzzling dish names such as “messy mozzarella”, “steak and lasagne” and “cheese and potato”, which read a bit as if a child had written out the courses for a pretend dinner party, though online reviews and photographs of the food suggest that the place is actually rather fancy, as well as much loved. Still, it was sidelined in my rush to the shiny, new, big-city openings of Glasgow or Edinburgh. Or Aberdeen or Inverness or, well, anywhere apart from Dumfries. This Scottish town of 30,000 is not terribly far from England, so it tends to fly under the radar for both tourists and fellow Scots, who perhaps feel it’s “not Scottish enough”, which is is flagrant nonsense. Circa 1605, James I of England and VI of Scotland, ever the optimist, decreed that the vast border area taking in the likes of Cumberland, Dumfriesshire, Selkirkshire and Northumberland, should be called the Middle Shires. This new, inclusive, touchy-feely name for the Borders would reflect the cosy unity between the two countries he planned to usher in during the 17th century. Scotland? England? Who cares? Lines on maps wouldn’t matter – we could all come together as one! The big, soft sod. Four hundred years on, Dumfries is still very much in Scotland; the white saltire on a blue background waves from flagpoles and pubs, the accent is gorgeously impenetrable for soft southerners such as my other half and, when you eat at Home, they begin dinner by giving you a map of all the local farms that supply them. The Ethical Dairy at Rainton Farm near Gatehouse of Fleet is celebrated alongside mozzarella from Kedar in Mouswald, and there are Nith Valley eggs from Gatelawbridge and veg from Loch Arthur in nearby Beeswing. This is an unashamed celebration of Scotland, of its produce and the place that Home’s owners, Louisa and Thomas Thorne, call home. Home is defiantly unswaggering: if you want to book, you call Louisa’s mobile (she’ll text you back quickly). There’s no Resy or Open Table to contend with. There’s no fancy website full of loquacious piffle. The name “Home” itself makes it hard to search for on Google, and the opening hours are so limited – Thursday and Fridays only from 5pm to 10pm – that you begin to wonder if Home believes it’s a real restaurant at all. Yet, once you’ve found it, close to the River Nith and despite no obvious signage, and been taken to your table while Fela Kuti and Belle and Sebastian play in the background, it all makes complete sense and is incredibly likable. Home was once housed above a pub, but has now moved into a rather large industrial space titivated only by a few strings of fairylights, some wall hangings, a big, warm welcome and some very good hummus and fresh focaccia. I’d take that over snootiness, crystal chandeliers and caviar any time. This is indeed, as so many had told me, a restaurant built on pure heart, serving a menu that’s at times quite fancy, but still has about it an utter dearth of pretension, as well as house pinot grigio at £3.50 a glass. You could blow up to £24 on a bottle of carmenere should you want to be flash, but, price-wise, that’s where the list peaks, although someone has drawn a lovely mermaid on the single-sheet paper menu. Then a perfect smoked haddock scotch egg arrives, runny-centred and crisp outside, on an emerald green velouté of wild garlic, followed by that beguiling “messy mozzarella”, which turns out to be the absolute opposite of a slapdash mess. Rather, it’s a beautifully executed dish featuring the innards of fresh, handmade mozzarella with basil and heritage tomato. “Cheese and potato”, meanwhile, turns out to be a classy plate of baby potatoes with an emulsion of something cheddary. Steak and lasagne is exactly what it says it is, albeit designed to complement each other, with the beef on the rare side and the chunk of lasagne fried, yet still oozing with bechamel – a nigh-impossible task that I’ve seen many well-intentioned chefs mess up. Perhaps Home is so incredibly Scottish because it refuses to be up itself in any way, including the doodle-covered menu and the Haribo-style sweets that turn up with the handwritten bill at the end. When it comes to the cooking, however, it’s probably one of the best restaurants within 100 miles or more. They’ll probably hate me for saying so, though, because now they’ll perhaps feel as if they ought to open maybe on Saturdays, too, serving their glorious squab pigeon on confit potatoes or the light, sweet, deliriously good honey panna cotta in a little jar with a honeycomb-style tuile on top. “Who is cooking?” I asked Louisa as we settled up. “My husband,” she said, pointing to the open kitchen. “He’s very good,” I said. “Oh, I won’t be telling him,” she smiled, handing me my sweeties to take home. “It will only go to his head.” This might be the most Scottish thing I’ve ever heard.

It’s a neighbour of Kingston upon Thames, and close to Worcester Park, Norbiton, Tolworth and many other semi-anonymous suburbs that never trouble the Places To Eat Before You Die foodie bucket lists. What gives the area its sparkle, however, is its large Korean population, as well as all the temporary visitors, and hungry South Korean and Chinese-Korean tourists. As a result, there are upwards of 20 more-than-decent Korean restaurants in New Malden, providing the opportunity to eat pajeon, bibimbap, bulgogi, noodles and hotpots; there are also a load of supermarkets where you can stock up on gochugaru and soju, plus cafes selling sweet treats such as patbingsu, a shaved ice dessert topped with sweet stewed adzuki beans that, to my mind, is one of the most delicious things on earth. It’s the firmness of the beans, you see, and the sugary hit of the burgundy-coloured sauce surrounding them. If you’re not hugely familiar with Korean food, consider patbingsu and the spring onion and/or seafood pancake pajeon as your gateway drugs. I had been tipped off that they served a very good pajeon at Cah Chi on the Kingston Road, a family-run spot that has changed venues a few times over the years and opened here only a month or so ago, but has retained a loyal fanbase for its simple yet delicious taste of home. I visited on a wet Wednesday lunchtime, half-expecting to be one of the only customers, but found the place packed, due in no small part to Cah Chi’s warm welcome, and to the fact that a round of steamed saewoo mandu (seafood dumplings) comes with some of the most glorious fresh banchan (small plates): a dainty pile of lush, green, wonderfully seasoned spinach, pickled cucumber, fierce, roughly hewn kimchi and a mound of black, sticky, braised soy beans. Then the pajeon arrives, teeming with spring onion, prawns and the odd squid tentacle, all suspended in a spongy, crisp batter made of rice flour, egg, soy and gochugaru. It is good. Very good. Perhaps a little thicker than the slender, elegant versions available at the likes of Yori in London’s fancy West End, but all the more luscious for it. A gorgeous side of half a fried aubergine arrives with a sticky glaze, its innards soft, pale and squishy, its black exterior still firmly bulbous. The whole thing is perfect, and hugely entertaining for the lunching Korean grandmothers watching me try to eat its slippery innards with stainless-steel chopsticks. What I lack in finesse, I make up for in hapless enthusiasm to transfer my deftly seasoned, soft-skinned mandu one by one into my mouth without spilling their bounteous filling down my front. Cah Chi is one of those cheap and cheerful, but decidedly good places that’s nothing to look at from the outside. It has about it a “lady-friendly”, floral-wallpapered air, though it’s decorated much more nicely than many hotels I’ve stayed in. Great staff, too, who love their community of older customers and seem to know them all by name. They’re also incredibly kind to women from Carlisle, and help me no end with my struggles to grill the beef bulgogi, bringing more fresh lettuce leaves to wrap it in, as well as extra helpings of their moreish soybean dipping paste. The bulgogi is sweet, slightly spicy and makes you wish, as you schlepp home, that you’d ordered more. My days of drinking soju are long over, so I drink barley tea, which is served in a dainty green teapot. I wasn’t much in the mood for anything sweet, either, but was ever so politely pushed by the lovely waitress into a small scoop of green tea ice-cream topped with a large blob of red-bean paste. New Malden is an umami-drenched patch of extreme deliciousness that’s only 20 minutes from Waterloo by train; sure, it’s not really en route to anywhere, but it is an eating destination in its own right. There are several theories as to how it became so very Korean: some say it’s because the Korean ambassador used to live here, others that it’s because of the relatively affordable house prices (well, for London, anyway). It can’t be because of the splendour of the train station, which feels older than time itself and is hidden behind a moody tower block. This area is proof, however, that when the stars align, the dining options can be quite incredible. Cah Chi isn’t trying to change the world; it’s just quietly representing skilful Korean cooking and creating a haven for hungry passers-by. Consider me a fan. Cah Chi 79-81 Kingston Road, New Malden, 020-8949 8880. Open Tues-Sun, lunch noon-3pm (4pm Sat &amp; Sun), dinner 5–10.30pm (10pm Sun).

Rolls and patties £1-£2.50, curries, stir fries and filled dosa £7.95-£11.95, sweets (six pieces) £6.95-£8.95 At Everest Curry King in Lewisham, they serve a beetroot curry that should silence even the most intimate of conversations. It’s not just the colour which, courtesy of the star ingredient, suggests a busy day down the abattoir, a neat trick for a vegetable rightly beloved of vegans. There’s the texture, which has both bite and softness, and the sweet-savoury depths that come when liberal spicing and coconut milk are cooked down together. It has an all-engrossing, soothing power. That describes so much of the food on offer here in a restaurant with a name that speaks of Nepal, but which mostly serves the dishes of Sri Lanka and south India more than 1,500 miles away to the south. Getting to eat this beetroot curry was a product of frustrating but, as it turned out, happy circumstance, although not for everyone. Today, you are meant to be reading about an intriguing nose-to-tail fish restaurant in Northern Ireland. In time you will. Unfortunately, within a couple of days of me eating there, they closed temporarily for a refurbishment. We couldn’t get in to take our lovely photographs. These things happen. I needed an emergency review and fell upon Rambutan, the much talked about Sri Lankan restaurant of chef Cynthia Shanmugalingam in London’s Borough Market. Rambutan is the restaurant of the book, which is to say the award-winning cookbook came first, and if the restaurant is anything like it, oh boy. It’s not just a collection of recipes, although those are diverting enough: for black pork belly curry and crunchy fried potatoes with turmeric, for coconut dal with kale, prawn curry with tamarind and so much more. It’s also an exquisitely illustrated journey across the culture and history of Sri Lanka, via its food. It is a song of coconut and sambols, of tempered spices, fresh curry leaves and fruit with salt and chilli. Having explored the book, I was eager to explore the restaurant. At short notice I had a table booked for a late lunch. And then, an hour before, they texted. The restaurant had been flooded by a storm. It was closed and lunch was cancelled. Sorry. I was now on deadline. It was my companion, the chef and writer Tim Anderson, who suggested we divert to Everest Curry King, not far from where he lives. It would, he said, be a very different take on Sri Lankan food. It had also been recommended to me over the years by a number of fellow south Londoners. It’s a simple place, they said, but oh so good. And now, after a mad dash across London, and a stroll past all the emerging tower blocks around Lewisham station, here I am. Everest Curry King was opened by the Sivarajah family just over 20 years ago to serve the local Sri Lankan community and is, basically, a takeaway with a few tables attached. There are glass-fronted cabinets stacked with metal trays filled in turn with vivid-coloured curries and stews, and more trays heaving with patties and rolls made with the flakiest of pastries, stained turmeric-yellow. Another counter is filled with bhajis and rotis and rainbow-coloured Indian sweets. On a counter behind is a bank of microwaves. The hard work building the layers of tempered spice in these dishes took place hours ago. The microwaves finish the job. On this weekday lunchtime, a queue of eager locals has quickly built up. One person tells me she comes here from Greenwich. Another says it’s the best thing about living in Lewisham. I won’t argue. Certainly, the appeal is obvious. The menu on the wall lists dishes to eat in at between £7.95 and £11.95 and portions are large. Expect not to pay very much at all, for really quite a lot. Our lunch is underpinned by a huge platter of golden grained, boldly spiced biryani, containing hunks of tender bone-in chicken, hard-boiled eggs, crisply fried fresh curry leaves and ribbons of red pepper. It is the base upon which everything else will lie. There is that beetroot curry, and another of aubergine, which has been gently fried down until it has a rich, toffee-like quality, and a third of shredded cabbage with a fine sour edge. There are two mutton curries on offer, one spicy, one less so. Both are the good dark brown stews. They bellow of ingredients that have hung about in each other’s company for a long time, until the meat is almost becoming a part of the gravy. We have the spicy version. It is not a heat which slaps you about the chops straight away. It builds, until you suddenly clock that your cheeks are slicked lightly with sweat. There are crisp-shelled mutton rolls, filled with more tender meat and spiced potato, and fish and vegetable patties bound in a flaky pastry that spill crumbs down your front. These are the snacks of so many gods. Alongside the offer of vegetable curry-filled dosa, those wondrous crêpes made from a fermented rice flour batter, they also have rust-coloured string hoppers or idiyappam. These are soothing spirals of steamed rice flour noodle which come with sothi, a rich coconut milk broth. You dunk one into the other. It’s a meditative and engrossing process. Add a little of their sambal of coarsely grated coconut. By now our table is full, as are we. This lot has cost us £35 and it’s clear some of it will need to be boxed up for the journey home. There is just space to try the sweet chilli prawns from a selection of deep red stir-fries, digging into the popularity of Indo-Chinese dishes. Everest is unlicensed, but there’s a fridge full of unfamiliar soft drinks, including King Coconut, a sweet coconut water with a light salty edge and Masala Jeera, a soda made, as the name suggests, with cumin. Apparently, it’s designed to aid digestion. It will leave you happily burping the rich aromatics of your spice cupboard. We get boxes of sweets to take away. Everest Curry King is a business built to serve a specific community. It does that job so well it has become a favourite among many other people, too. I have every sympathy for Rambutan, flooded out by a cloudburst. Do get hold of the book, then perhaps try the restaurant. But I can’t pretend. I’m delighted that the wretched flood resulted in me finding my way to this beetroot curry. News bites The chef Alexis Gauthier, who took his eponymous high-end restaurant in Soho entirely vegan a few years ago, is expanding. Next month he is opening two restaurants in a space on London’s Tottenham Court Road. 123V Bakery is a vegan café serving baked goods and rustic salads and various lunch items. It is a continuation of the idea first trialled in the department store Fenwick in 2021. Meanwhile Studio Gauthier will, like Gauthier in Soho, serve a vegan tasting menu, although it will, he says, be a little more relaxed than the mothership. At 123vegan.co.uk. While there’s clearly a lot of gloomy news around the hospitality sector right now, there are still people who see it as a worthwhile investment. Restaurant company MJMK, which is behind both Kol and Lisboeta and has the peri peri chicken group Casa do Frango, has announced it has exceeded its recent £1m crowdfunding target. The cash will be used to open a second Kol and a fourth Casa do Frango. At the same time the Rosa’s Thai brand, which has 33 sites across England and Wales, has secured £10m of funding for expansion. Livia Alarcon, former head chef at Maray in Liverpool, and head chef at Queen’s bistro in the city when I reviewed it so approvingly, is now in charge of her own restaurant. La Bistrotheque, inside Liverpool’s Baltic Market, is described as a European bistro. The menu includes popcorn mussels with salt and vinegar, a rosti with creamed spinach and chimichurri and a duck confit and peppercorn choux bun. See balticmarket.co.uk.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(540,'2023-05-26T11:00:32Z','The Midland Grand, London NW1: ‘This may be the campest restaurant in the UK’ – restaurant review | Grace Dent on restaurants','The Midland Grand might be one of the most useful recent restaurant openings in the entire UK. Of course, no restaurant wants to be called useful; they’d much prefer flowery prose such as “gastronomically enlightening” or “a shattering orgasm for the tastebuds” or some other stuff they’d be able to regurgitate on the promotional material. The Midland Grand, however, is both very grand and mere metres from both King’s Cross and St Pancras stations, should you be passing through and not want to go much farther. It’s in a side wing of the reliably fabulous St Pancras Renaissance Hotel, which I often tell visitors to London is the “big, gothic, Harry Potter-esque one that you really can’t help but notice because it’s so fantastic”. The Renaissance is a paean to what can happen when we treat beautiful old things such as 19th-century, neo-gothic, 300-room hotels nicely, rather than rip them down to build new retail experiences. Until recently, the main dining room at the Renaissance was presided over by that denim-eyed hunk Marcus Wareing, in what was called The Gilbert Scott, but now the winning duo of chef Patrick Powell and property developer and restaurateur Harry Handelsman have taken over and, after blowing cash left, right and centre, turned it into a glittering, opulent, gold room that RuPaul might say gives off very Marie Antoinette’s boudoir vibes, as well as Liberace in Las Vegas and Elton John’s 50th birthday party ones (Elton’s Louis XIV wig was so big, he had to be transported in a lorry); to enter the room, you also pass the staircase where the Spice Girls filmed the Wannabe video. In fact, now that I think about it, this may well be the campest restaurant in the UK, if not the world. Campness aside, you could meet your mother off the 12.22 train from Peterborough, collect her at platform seven at King’s Cross, take her somewhere incredibly glamorous that’s not even 0.1 miles away, have a glass of sherry in the Gothic Bar adjacent to the dining room, feed her on paté en croute and roast lamb with pommes anna in a room where she can actually hear herself speak because the acoustics are perfect, then pop her back on the 14.46 train home without her having to set foot in any meaningful way in that awful, filthy London. A word of warning, though: this all comes at a price. Parisian architect and designer Hugo Toro doesn’t do cheap – the man has never set foot in The Range furniture store or even seen a polyester scatter cushion. And that paté en croute costs £16 and the roast lamb £38. This is fine dining, albeit a commendably hearty take on the genre. A trio of light, heavenly comte gougeres with a pickled walnut topping (think cheese profiteroles) are unmissable, and £8. Gildas made with grilled octopus, pickled chilli and a Gordal olive are delicious, and £4 a skewer. One of the more out-there dishes is snails bourguignon with ’nduja and guanciale that’s served on the world’s fanciest hash brown, aka pommes paillasson. Whether Brits will ever truly take to escargots is debatable, but there are bound to be enough French visitors from the nearby Eurostar to enjoy this rich, salty meeting of porky, umami, fatty flavours that is redolent of Lyon. The Midland Grand is very much an occasion restaurant, with chairs so plump and sumptuous that you’ll need help to move them from the staff, of whom there are dozens, all bright, friendly, not remotely up themselves and clad in beautiful frock coats. I ate a delightful, very light salad of courgette and stracciatella with flaked almonds and a hint of lemon – it was less of a salad and more of a health-giving dessert, but lovely nevertheless. I followed that with a generous piece of perfectly poached chalk stream trout in a pool of smoked butter and vermouth beurre blanc. There is also a rather delightful potato dauphinoise on offer, either as a small side or, for the truly carefree, a large one. Mind you, if I’d been settling in for a longer, more indulgent lunch, I would definitely have ordered the john dory with vadouvan spices, mussels and fried curry leaf to share. Dessert was a peach soufflé with ice-cream, which disappeared in a hurricane of gluttony as my friend Hugh and I warred over it. We also tried a strawberry, almond and clotted cream Paris-Brest, which was French patisserie meets Devon cream tea with definitely pleasing results. The Midland Grand is fancy, tasty, pricey, memorable, beautiful and incredibly usefully close to transport links. It might be a bit much for some and extortionate for others, but for many it will be just the ticket. The Midland Grand St Pancras Renaissance Hotel, Euston Road, London NW1, 020-7341 3000.

Meal for two, starters £7.50-£8.50, mains £16-£29, desserts £7.50, wines from £24 The restaurant stands by the river. The river runs down to the sea, where the fish swim deep. The fish are brought to the restaurant that stands by the river which runs down to the sea. Do excuse me, but there’s just something about the simplicity of Lir, hard by the River Bann in Northern Ireland, which brings out the terrible Ernest Hemingway parody act in me. I promise it won’t happen again. The Coleraine business was born out of a fascination with the sea, and a belief by owners Rebekah and Stevie McCarry that not enough of the fabulous seafood caught by the day boats working off the Northern Irish coast ends up being eaten by those who live on the shore. The idea behind Lir, an old Irish word for sea, may be simple; the journey to get here was not. In January 2020 they took over the gracefully knackered yacht club at Coleraine, with plans for their restaurant. A pandemic got in the way. With a young family to support, they set up an online fishmonger’s, delivering local fish to local doors, wrapped only in paper tied with twine. Eventually, they were able to open the kitchen, but the facilities were so basic they headed towards street food: lobster rolls, squid shawarma, ling fish dogs and the like. Eventually they raised the money for a refurbishment which ended up taking more than two years. In the meantime, they set up another venue called the Pool, in a bare-bones shed on the beach at Portstewart, which housed a wet-fish counter, a restaurant and a live events space. It had shutters for walls and when the storms came, as they always do around these parts, it would flood. One surge almost wiped them out. Even so the Pool went on to win multiple restaurant awards. Now here they are, back in the refurbished yacht club, which is clean-lined and broad. It has sexy downlighters, tasteful art and a cocktail menu involving strong spirits and butch foraged things like gorse. There’s a deck overlooking the placid river and a menu headed by a declaration of intent. They are, they say, about zero waste and sustainability; about whole fish butchery, fermenting, smoking and generally sticking close to home. Once they’ve got the fillets, they use the rest for stocks and fish sausages and even fish-based charcuterie. All of which profound nerdiness is delightful but useless if the slogans don’t result in good things to eat. They do. Some of them are very good indeed, and expressed via a profoundly Northern Irish commitment to portions that will get you through a hard winter, even if it’s spring. Here comes a deep-fried hake “Kiev”. It’s a golden-brown barrel-shaped piece of beautifully cooked white fish, the size of a one-person submarine. It’s filled with a wild garlic butter emulsion, the green of grass clippings, and comes with a properly sustaining pillow of mash, and shredded savoy cabbage pelted with crisp bacon lardons. Cut into the fish, and watch the dish self-sauce, until everything is lubricated with the finest garlic butter known to humanity. They like their sauces at Lir. A monkfish sausage roll, the glossy puff pastry so exquisitely laminated you don’t know whether to eat it or put it on a plinth, comes with a thick fermented chilli ketchup with just the right bash of warming heat. A judicious spoonful of gochujang has been added to the mayo with the kimchi slaw that lies beneath a rustling pile of crispy squid. A slab of beef short rib has first been brined with spent coffee grounds, then slow-cooked for two days before being seared. It reads performatively, doesn’t it? Look at all the fiddly things we have done to this small rectangle of quality meat. But who doesn’t love a good story, when it produces something as delightfully tender and crisp as this? And of course, it comes with their own sauce, a brown one made with the deep caramel tones of a local IPA. I could whinge about the mackerel caesar salad, because it’s a deconstruction. On one side is a slab of little gem, dribbled with something creamy and caesar-like. On the other is a sourdough crouton piled with shredded pieces of hot smoked mackerel and curls of parmesan. No, it isn’t a caesar. It’s various things that might be involved with a caesar. But if you put the title aside, it is a very good dish. The lettuce is sprinkled with cured and fried pieces of ling, playing the part of bacon lardons. The mackerel is oily, smoky and pleasingly intense. The menu here changes daily. Tonight’s main courses include satiny pockets of well-made pasta filled with salt cod, in a classic butter sauce, and a sweet and nutty barley and wild mushroom risotto on a pea purée. It’s topped with a fist-sized piece of miso-glazed and roasted monkfish. It’s inventive and thoughtful stuff, without being annoyingly so. There are occasional missteps. A lobster béarnaise sauce served with a long-aged ex-dairy-cow sirloin sounds like a very good idea. It’s just overly acidic. Happily, it’s balanced out by a lovely little tartlet of caramelised onion in a cup of flaky pastry. We finish with a wobbly slice of miso caramel tart and a chocolate sponge ice-cream sandwich. Faced by a menu of monkfish, mackerel, ling and so much else, even one which makes a point of using every part of the fish, questions of sustainability do have to be addressed. I am assured that, unlike some seafood places, at Lir they know which local boats the catch comes from and the skippers doing the catching. They know, too, which fishing grounds are sustainable and which species are thriving there. The fishmonger’s remains a part of the business, as is the streetfood offering, under the name Native Seafood &amp; Scran. If you can’t get a table inside for the more intricate menu, come to the deck for squid bhajis and lobster sesame toast. In an area not renowned for its ambitious restaurant choices, this is one which deserves to thrive. Also, if you happen to be nearby and in need of breakfast, head to the truly delightful Babushka café on the harbour at Portrush. They do a very strong line in smoky beans, with exceptional sausages and bacon from a local butcher. I dream still of their breakfast bun, filled with soy and gochujang-glazed crispy pork belly and red cabbage slaw. That will get you going the morning after. News bites Kino, the restaurant attached to the home of Opera North in Leeds, has appointed a new chef to replace the Middle Eastern MorMor, whose residency has come to an end. Josh Whitehead, a former Professional MasterChef semi-finalist, joins from the Coach and Horses in Harrogate. Until 11 June he is running a preview ‘Test Kitchen’ menu, with two courses for £24 and three for £29. It includes roast duck with braised endive, and popcorn polenta with grilled and tempura mushrooms and grilled onions. A full menu will then run from the end of June (kinoleeds.co.uk). Carinito, a renowned Taco restaurant in Mexico City, is coming to London for a two-month residency from the end of May. The Carinito team will be in residence at the wine bar Oranj in Shoreditch, with a menu including guacamole with British brown shrimps, pulled pork belly with rice powder, chicharron and fresh mint, and confit cauliflower with citrus and fermented bean puree. Visit @oranj on Instagram for more. With all the interest in new openings, it’s easy to forget the pioneers. Farewell then to one of them: the great Brian Stein, founder of the Maxwell’s Restaurant Group, who has died aged 79. At its peak in 2010, Maxwell’s, an American bar and grill, had outposts all over London and in Oxford and employed more than 400 people, though eventually fell victim to the pandemic. The original in Hampstead was the first restaurant I went to as a precocious teen, without parents in tow. The memory of it holds a rather special place in my overfed heart.

This fork-free zone will come as a relief to some informal diners, who find all those butter knives, dessert spoons, cheese scoops and grape shears a bit bamboozling. It may, however, dismay anyone wearing a non-wipeable fabric such as cashmere. Homies on Donkeys is more of a sou’wester kind of place, with added salsa verde and chipotle on your chin when you pay the bill. It’s also a place for people who like 1990s hip-hop, graffiti-strewn walls and the sensation of eating in a suburban skate park: Naughty By Nature, Main Source, Gang Starr and Grand Puba blare from the stereo as I sit at a table that is absolutely nowhere near big enough for all the tacos, large plates, sides and drinks that we’ve ordered; we’re also wedged in next to the till, where the servers are constantly ringing in orders. While the seating may not be ideal, the soundscape just about makes up for it. This isn’t a 90s-themed restaurant, but if you’re of a certain age, remember the Beastie Boys back when they were gobby kids, videoed Dance Energy with Normski on BBC Two or ever got grounded for tagging your neighbour’s garage, this place is like sensory whiplash with tacos on top. Homies on Donkeys – vibrant, nonconformist, independent – is also one of the more exciting things to have happened to this distant area of east London for a while, where the grand plan seems to be to let developers build and build and build new blocks of flats, so filling the postcode with new residents, while at the same time restaurant openings, with all their prohibitive rates and outgoings, have virtually ground to a halt. Bautista and Bello made this new venture possible via crowdfunding, after a popular five-year stint in Walthamstow, where they had all of eight seats. By 6pm on a Friday night, their new venture was already at full capacity and they were fighting off the crowds at the door. The informality and relatively affordable prices are clearly a draw – it’s £8 for a plate of two heavily filled spicy chicken barbacoa tacos – thighs cooked slowly in a secret mix, served with a smoky, spicy guajillo and a tomato salsa that takes no prisoners, and topped with sweet onion and coriander. Camarón enchilado, or king prawn tacos, are equally complex and lovingly made: fat prawns in a heroic amount of garlic and chilli, served in a tomato base on a fresh taco. The food is truly astonishingly good. These are dishes that have clearly been carefully honed, with no heed to the notion of even thinking about pulling back on the spice, acid, sweetness or umami. Even the refried beans have a smooth, intoxicating, miso-like undertone that lifts them from mere afterthought to star of the show, and all this is done with the sort of informality that will probably puzzle more discerning diners who want bells, whistles and forlock-tugging. So, Homies on Donkeys definitely doesn’t stand on ceremony, but it does serve well-seasoned, top-class, lemony and almost buttery guacamole with a mound of hot, crisp, freshly cooked corn chips the likes of which I’ve never tasted in my long career of dipping things into other things at Mexican eateries. The menu is almost wholly tacos, though one special this particular Friday was braised tuna pibil, for which tuna loin is stewed in achiote and served with wafer-thin radish, pickled onion and habanero chilli. Another special of very rich, slow-cooked, braised chuck was deeply flavoured and devourable, and came flanked by wobbly bone marrow still in its bone, Pedigree Chum advert-style, topped with pico de gallo and accompanied by gorgeous corn tortillas. This dish should feature on an end of year roundup list of “debauched things that offer nothing-but-calories happiness”. There’s no dessert menu, and we were quickly handed a bill so we’d vacate our spot as soon as possible. Then again, people hanging about and poking their panna cotta are the enemy of profit nowadays. If I ever get a table at Homies on Donkeys again, I’ll wear spongeable polyester and looser-fitting denim next time. This is not Claridge’s – in fact, I’ve had a comfier seat at Costa Coffee – but they play Kool G Rap while you eat, you leave very full and the bill is utterly reasonable. In many ways, that’s about as good as life gets. Homies on Donkeys 686 High Road Leytonstone, London E11, 07729 368896.

Snacks £3.50-£8.50, small plates £10-£15, large plates £23-£42, wines from £25 There are many things that might improve a restaurant experience. Having a stranger’s chunky dog rub its hind quarters against you, then lick your companion’s hand is not one of them. The team at the Parakeet in London’s Kentish Town might well feel this is an unfair way to begin this column, given the plaudits they’ve received for their food. They’re about to get a few more of those plaudits. But I review restaurants, not just the food they serve. The first thing I mentioned to friends after eating there wasn’t the lovely lamb belly with courgette and anchovy or the terrific house pickles – we’ll come back to them – but the bloody dog. And the way various waiters told me they hated the pro-dog policy (guide dogs, excepted). To not open with that would therefore have misrepresented the experience, even though it’s asking for trouble. Dog lovers can be an ardent, overheated lot who think every room everywhere can only be improved by the presence of a canine, restless or otherwise. I’m genuinely glad your dogs bring you so much love and comfort and companionship. I just don’t want one indulging in rigorous arse-end frottage against me while I’m trying to get into the asparagus. Is that so weird? The Parakeet, formerly the Oxford Tavern, is a big-boned old pub, with a large bar at the front and, at the back, beyond the velvet curtain, a large, square dining room, complete with vivid stained-glass touches and lots of wood panelling. The menu is on a wall-mounted blackboard. Sit beneath it, as I did, and you will enjoy a procession of fellow punters standing in front of you, staring over your head and photographing it before sitting down again. Tucked away in the back of that dining room is a semi-open kitchen complete with an on-trend live-fire grill. It comes with the territory. The head chef is Ben Allen, who worked for a while at Brat where chef Tomos Parry turned cooking whole turbot over fire and smoke into an art form. In London and elsewhere these days, you can keep your induction hobs and your high-spec electric ovens. If you can’t singe your waxed beard on it, what’s the point? I’m trying to sound cynical and jaded, but in truth I love this stuff. Bring on the smoke and the indirect heat and the occasional lick of flame. Here at the Parakeet, Allen and his sous chef Ed Jennings use it to good effect. Among the bar snacks for £6 is a smoked mutton sausage. I want a fridge full of these at home. The meat is coarsely ground and smoky enough to remind you of the grill backstage. The balance of fat to peppery meat is perfectly judged and the casing just tight enough so that you get the lightest of squeaks when you bite in. On the side is a dollop of grain mustard to ease things along. Then there are those slow-cooked lamb ribs, now separating into their layers, which pull away from the bone. The surface is glazed and burnished by the heat, before being layered with a fine dice of courgette and salted anchovy alongside a smooth courgette purée. There is a mutton dish, some ox cheeks and a smoked chicken terrine. That grill really does do the heavy lifting. But their vegetable game is also strong. Leeks are cooked until soft and layered with a thick pecorino cream. It’s that cheese in grainy liquid form. Across the top are chewy smoked mushrooms. Asparagus are shredded and laid on a deep ajo blanco, a rich garlicky sauce made from ground almonds. We have a couple of their cigar-like crab croquettes, with a liquid brown meat centre, and a brace of their plump oysters with a lightly acidic dressing and strands of both fermented kohlrabi and seaweed. Their £4 house pickle plate, with halves of artichoke heart and celery and petals of onion, is so good we order two. Pieces of trout in a bright butter sauce are pretty to look at. That sauce is a fancy piece of work. But the fish is so soft, so mushy, you could consume the whole plateful with a straw. It’s a rare down note. But there’s something else. Brat made its name by doing flamey, smoky things with big lumps of protein: huge whole fish; ruby-muscled, fat-striated chunks of beef; mutton chops tasting of the hills. For all the intense, furrow-browed, Michelin-starred cheffiness it’s quite pubby. The Brat menu would sit comfortably in the Parakeet. Meanwhile the food at the Parakeet is really quite, well, restauranty. Which isn’t an adjective, but should be. The crab croquettes come with tiny whorls of mayo placed just so and a sprinkle of edible blooms. There are just two of the precisely cut lamb ribs, and a suspicion that tweezers were involved with the placement of the hyper-engineered pieces of courgette. Even their confit potato is presented in a whimsical spiral rather than the usual sturdy Jenga block. They do offer a whole sea bream, but that’s it. You could sell this as a refreshing move away from live-fire dude food, but it could also be seen as straining against the very idea of a food pub. It’s actually a quite fancy restaurant, where the bill builds quickly for less than large portions. It just happens to be in the back room of a pub. Which brings this full circle. A pub with a pro-dog policy is obviously fine. A restaurant like this with a pro-dog policy really isn’t. Early on, I ask the dog’s owners if they might move it to the other side of their table. They tell me they can’t. Because the table on their other side also has a dog with them. Unasked, we are comped our mint teas “because of the dog”. Statement of the obvious: the management of the Parakeet can do what the hell they like. If they’ve got a thriving business, complete with hounds slouching all over the parquet, fair enough. I just won’t be going back, however good the food, however charming the service. And both of these really are great. Take your mind off the canines with dessert. Try the delightful kouign-amann, a finely laminated, caramelised Breton pastry supplied by nearby Kossoffs bakery, served in a frothy pond of warm vanilla cream. Or have a slab of the truly exemplary dark chocolate torte, with a cooling quenelle of whipped cream. Perhaps pat the bulldog on the way out, just to show willing. Or don’t. News bites More live fire news, as former Great British Menu finalist Joe Baker announces he is opening a new restaurant on his native Jersey next month, utilising a bespoke wood grill. Pêtchi, which means ‘to try to catch a fish’ in the island’s traditional dialect, will occupy the top floors of a former harbourmaster’s office, and will serve wood-roasted lobster rice, ex-dairy beef chop with smoked olive oil and wood-roasted scallops with white asparagus. Pêtchi is a successor to Number 10, his previous restaurant on the island, which closed at the start of this year (petchi.je). The two outposts of Chinese restaurant group Baoziinn, in London’s Soho and Borough, have announced the launch of a Green Feast Menu in collaboration with Omni Foods, which makes and markets a plant-based meat substitute. The extensive meat-free menu, available seven days a week, includes a lengthy list of dumplings and buns as well as the likes of aubergine with sweet and sour sauce, broccoli and cauliflower with garlic and their take on mapotofu (baoziinn.com). In Cornwall chef Jeffrey Robinson and his wife, Caroline, are opening a sustainability-focused food pub. Their previous restaurant, New Yard in Mawgan, used ingredients from their own walled garden and changed the menu daily depending upon what was available. Harbour House in the village of Flushing, which opens next month, will operate in a similar way, with an offering of ‘whole-grilled fish’ as well as ‘steak for two’ (harbourhouseflushing.com).

The current hospitality climate suggests that, by 2024, my closest “restaurant” on the east London/Essex border could well be the Cinnabon concession at my local Asda, a profitable meeting of big brands selling 1,090 calorie-a-whirl, factory-made caramel PecanBons, so my hope is that, by the time the current madness eventually ends, at least some family-run, bespoke, flights of the imagination such as Clay’s will have survived. Serving authentic Hyderbadi food that will puzzle anyone looking for a garish orange chicken tikka masala with half-rice, half-chips, Clay’s is now in its second incarnation, this time in a suburb of Reading north of the town centre. If you take the train to Reading, you can walk to Clay’s in 10-15 minutes, through the park and over Caversham bridge, which at the moment has a Hitchcockian number of ducks, geese and swans milling about, which is wonderful, although ornithophobics may prefer to take a cab. Either way, you cannot miss Clay’s: it was once a Wetherspoon’s, ergo it is enormous, and the front is now painted TeleTubbies Laa-Laa-yellow with Royal Mail-red lettering. Everything about Clay’s says: “This time, we are going big.” Nandana Syamala and her husband, Sharat, first opened their doors on London Street in the heart of Reading back in 2018, and quickly made a name for themselves with their clay-pot biryanis, squid pakoras and bhuna venison. Then, in lockdown, they started sending out mail-order, vacuum-packed curries and sides, delivering first around Reading and then, hyper-ambitiously, nationwide. Many “professional eaters” raved about them, lapping up Clay’s kheema biryani, spiced fried chicken livers and beetroot potato tikki. Pivoting to home delivery during lockdown to save your restaurant’s skin was not, I’ll wager, the tremendous fun that many chefs tried to make it look on Instagram. Rather, it was a logistical headache. Clay’s not only made it work, but they then made plans to move to a larger venue, which, due to building issues, was delayed and left them unable to trade through December 2022 and almost took them under. Nandana’s blog about opening the new, improved Clay’s is candid: “I have put everything into this, including my health, wealth and soul. I am not the same person I was a few years ago. I have lost a bit of myself to Clay’s … All I have is this obsession with creating something special.” Well, Clay’s is indeed special. It’s impossible to sit down with a generous plate of its cabbage pakora with green coriander chutney or crab minapa garelu (savoury crab doughnuts), and not think that this is thoughtfully made and determinedly different from what many of us are used to with high-street Indian dining. Those “donuts” are a rather gothic-looking dish of crab meat formed into small, chubby rings, dipped in peppery black gram flour, then deep-fried and submerged in a bowl of rather brown tomato and curry leaf rasam. Chepala pulusu, an Andhra-style fish curry cooked, the menu says, “the way my mom makes it”, is also gloriously, defiantly brown, and features a large chunk of cod in a rich, punchily spiced tamarind sauce that’s ideal for scooping up with blush-coloured beetroot roti and methi roti all fragrant with fenugreek leaves. This is a vast, echoey room that needs some work on the acoustics, as well as possibly more staff on the floor, because the ones they’ve got seem to be working flat out already. But the food more than makes up for the occasional chaos: those chicken livers, or bhooni khaleji, for instance, were fried in heaps of cumin and coriander and had a lovely rush of dried mango powder. Clay’s rightly renowned Hyderabadi-style dum biryani is fluffy and fragrant, can be made with mutton, paneer, shrimp, lamb or chicken, and comes with a cooling raita and, rather than the usual high-street, soupy sauce, a balm-like, toffee-coloured, creamy salan. In fact, Clay’s made me go home, get out some books and try to work out exactly what I’d eaten, such as the mahekhalya sauce with the beef osso bucco that’s made from onions and crushed coconut, or the Portuguese-influenced shrimp moilee with coconut milk and curry leaves. Having gone big on the vankaya fry of long aubergines in peanut and sesame seed and the tomato pappu – a dal with tomato and black mustard seeds – there was no room left for dessert, so I have no idea what the anokhi kheer, or Hyderabadi onion pudding garnished with pistachio, even looks like. But Clay’s has one of those menus that I feel I’ll keep going back to. Food doesn’t get much more personal than this and there is a pure Field of Dreams vibe to the fact that it even exists: “If you build it, they will come,” Shoeless Joe said in that film. In Clay’s case, I think they will. Clay’s Kitchen &amp; Bar 22-24 Prospect Street, Caversham, Reading, Berkshire, 0118-947 6060, hello@clayskitchen.co.uk for bookings.

It’s much swankier than Miznon, his pitta restaurant in Soho and Notting Hill, but his chaotic spirit has not been quashed. You may recall from my visit to Miznon last year that Shani leans towards purple prose when writing menus; his dishes read like the late Mark E Smith from The Fall performing beat poetry. “Six spicy instruments that will swirl your soul,” shouts the menu, describing what transpires to be a mixed plate of runny, oily, meze-type dipping things hewn out of roast red peppers, chopped green pepper and spins on matbucha, some of them hot with aleppo pepper. I’d love to tell you the nitty gritty of what was on that delightful plate, but, like much at Lilienblum (and at Miznon, for that matter), you have to order and hope for the best. Indeed, the bright, helpful servers are trained to translate, which must be exhausting, but then the flurry of terms in a noisy room just adds to the dishes’ mystery. The “Six Spicy Instruments” did not come with bread, so I ordered some called “It’s a very bad idea to order this but there will be no regrets”, which revealed itself to be two pieces of crunchy, firm focaccia topped with a generous quenelle of cream cheese and covered in honey and pouring cream. It was richer than any dessert, completely irresistible and useless for the task of dipping in meze (unless, that is, you happen to be wearing spongeable coveralls). Nothing at Lilienblum is straightforward, but what saves it from being annoying is the cooking – both Shani’s vision and head chef Oren King’s skill and judicious use of flavour. King has previously worked at the likes of Dinner by Heston Blumenthal, Roka and Hide, and that level of opulence and attention to detail is here in the extremely good and spicy mesabaha of lima beans and hard-boiled egg, and in the vast terrine of aubergine “melanzana”, which leaves the stuff I’ve eaten at a thousand Italian restaurants looking awkward. King is running a sort of elegant, earthy, Ottolenghi mashup of Honey &amp; Co and The Palomar, with a menu and vision by Shani, who writes dish descriptions like someone shouting their sitcom ideas at you from the back of a dance tent. Somehow, it all works. Somewhere during my first visit to Lilienblum, just as happened when I went to Miznon, I was already tucking it up my sleeve as somewhere to direct people to for the straightforward reason that the food tastes very good. There’s a cocktail list with Eyal martinis at £12 a pop; the house white is a viognier at £35 a bottle, and there is sparkling Israeli pet nat for £65. This is a capacious place suitable for groups needing somewhere civilised to hang out around the bunfight of weekend Old Street/Shoreditch, but here it’s the food that brings the mayhem. We had the hamachi sashimi, billed on the menu as, “I trained for years to cut sashimi like this”, and which came in a rather subtle, ponzu-style dressing. From the cheaper end of the menu, we ordered the minute steak tahini, which was a pile of meat dripping in hulled sesame with more chopped tomatoes. It was tasty, albeit rather cheap-and-cheerful feeling for a relatively affordable £22; after that, the likes of lamb chops with salat aravi leap up to £48, but that’s par for the course when eating in nice places these days. Desserts, however, are a very reasonable £8, and completely worth saving room for. A honking great piece of lemony pistachio cake with a delightful, damp, raspberry-embossed bottom came with lots of fresh cream and more fresh raspberries. It was clearly homemade that day, and for that I was very grateful. Same, too, for the naked chocolate cake;, a thick, exuberantly rich, flourless rib-sticker that comes with more fresh cream garnished with strawberries. The chocolate mousse is accompanied by fresh, warm, salted butter cookies that are almost unbearably good. Chef sent apologies that his Basque cheesecake hadn’t quite set and wasn’t available that night, and I’ve since thought about that cheesecake a lot. In a restaurant landscape increasingly filled with dessert lists that translate as “eat up and get out”, there is a definite reach here to make puddings as important as the “hummus just the way we like it” or the “abundance of salad brightened with chardonnay and EVOO”. Shani already has plans to open two more restaurants in London soon. You can say a lot of things about Lilienblum and Miznon, but none of those things are boring.

That’s because it’s a new restaurant by the people behind the much-loved Marksman, a Hackney gastropub that’s been offering thoughtful, hearty cooking and fine ingredients since 2015, and has become shorthand for “dependably good”. Not much on the South Bank has the benefit of this kind of reputation. Yes, the strip between Waterloo Bridge and Tower Bridge is replete with restaurants, and there is food everywhere, yet there’s not a jot you really want to eat. The area is a sea of Las Iguanas, Strada, Côte, Giraffe and about 25 other chains all seemingly with the sole purpose of being convenient places to meet, and serving airport food with such a dearth of love and attention that it is barely eating at all – rather simply something to consume while sitting down. But at Lasdun, Jon Rotheram and Tom Harris, recently joined by John Ogier, previously of Lyle’s and Flor, are offering guinea fowl and Tamworth terrine with burnt pear, Hereford sirloin with ox tongue and Tropea onions, as well as vast, Desperate Dan-style sharing pies filled with chicken, wild garlic and leek or, for vegetarians, celeriac, leek and Wigmore cheese, and for which the Marksman is so rightly lauded. Oh, and the brown butter and honey custard tartlet that’s so popular in their original home that customers reserve slices when ordering their main courses, causing wildly territorial scenes. Opening a restaurant in a place such as this, or indeed in any large, established gallery, arts centre or department store, is never easy, and these marriages can befuddle even the most skilled of restaurateurs. Many of their customers feel that they know what the space is, so the tapestry is pretty much already woven. The restaurant then often ends up as a barely tolerated interloper trying to stamp its personality on some roped-off part of the foyer, roof garden or long-deserted cafe site. At Lasdun, however, they also have to contend with the fact that the National Theatre is vast, dramatically dark, multi-floored and has largely useless signage so you can never find anything. It’s also staffed by mostly uninterested ushers who don’t seem to care whether or not you find Lasdun; it’s not their job. After roaming the building for some time, and feeling very much like David St Hubbins from Spinal Tap lost backstage in Cleveland, I located lunch just as I’d almost given up hope. A rather beautiful, grand room with dark wood floors and formal tablecloths presented itself, and the familiar clanking of lunch was in full swing. There is no passing trade at Lasdun, plus you need a compass, a working knowledge of all the entrances in the entire area, the tenacity to beat the sourpusses at security who tell you that “the brasserie is closed”, as well as the willpower to make it past the excellent gift shop without blowing £50 on postmodern poetry anthologies and a jar of National Theatre honey. I highly recommend making the effort, though. In fact, if I were meeting anyone on the South Bank, I would not book anywhere else, because this is careful, ornate, modern British cooking that leans on the likes of Cornish pollock, Barnsley chops, London Cure smoked salmon and Jersey Royals, with buttery sauces and the general vibe of a mother trying to feed you up on a visit home. Devilled eggs topped with salty fish roe spill their mustardy mayo innards down your shirt. There’s black treacle sourdough and homemade crisps. A pile of rare grilled lamb chops comes on a nicely seasoned puddle of anchovy-heavy tomato sauce with olives. A whopping chunk of cod with a crisp brown skin sits in a buttery, brown-shrimp-and-cucumber sauce. For vegetarians, there is fragrant, braised barley on king oyster mushrooms with saffron. Tamworth pork shoulder with spring greens was on the menu the day we went, too. We resisted the hand-cut chips and the wild garlic butter-drenched jersey royals, and opted instead for a side of bibb lettuce dressed in buttermilk, which felt more fitting for a hot summer’s day and was very welcome, too, not least because a lot of the menu seems more suited for eating by a cosy winter hearth, rather than in 30-degree heat. Still, we somehow managed to linger for a full three hours, dissecting life, as did many other tables, because once you’re inside Lasdun, it feels as if you’ve left the actual world and have entered a place within a place within another place where no one can find you, so let’s just order the dark chocolate cream – think souped-up, fancy mousse – with buckwheat parfait, sherry caramel and chocolate crumb. While we’re at it, it would be rude not to order that honey tart, too, because the National Theatre bees on the top of the building worked hard to make it. The cheeseboard is all-British, featuring the likes of Cornish Yarg and Little Rollright with celery jam and oatcakes. Lasdun is by far the best place to eat on the South Bank, which sounds like I’m damning it with faint praise, but book a spot regardless.

Polentina is the work of Sophia Massarella, a photographer and a forensically passionate fan of Italian food, although it is clearly the cooking side that has taken over of late. Massarella, a Canadian, started a business during lockdown to recreate the polenta, pasta and salad dishes so loved by the Italian side of her family. Her next, entirely illogical step was to take on this small space in the staff canteen of the sustainable fashion factory ApparelTasker, though, in a world where rent, rates and food and staffing costs thwart much creativity in cooking, nothing is remotely logical any more. Anyone with enough investment can serve gold-leafed slop in Mayfair, but it requires genuine guts and passion to take on a few tables in Bow that look out on a load of sewing machines. On the day I went for lunch, one dish on the blackboard menu read: “Pomodori col riso, £13”. Massarella had stuffed big, fat Sorrento tomatoes – the type of lush, red fruit we Brits spot on our holidays, eat avidly and declare: “Now this is what a tomato should taste like.” Here, it had been hollowed out, stuffed brimful with herby, tomatoey carnaroli rice, then baked until the sweet flesh was yielding, yet somehow still supportive of its innards. I inhaled this tomato while pointing out to Charles the umpteen ways this “simple” dish would be ruined by a less able cook (ie, me). How was the rice al dente, even though it had soaked up so much flavour? How did the tomato’s skin support the weight of the stuffing, while being so pleasingly squishy? And was this side of fried potatoes for sharing, because, sadly, I had eaten them all? The other main course on offer that day was a bowl of excellent fresh spaghetti aglio, olio, peperoncino and bottarga – a tangle of pasta, garlic, fish roe and a hint of chilli finished with good olive oil for £15. The food at Polentina is wonderful, but I cannot say that everything else about eating here isn’t rather peculiar, because it absolutely is. Lunch was served at 1pm on the dot, and the factory staff ate at the same time as the random diners, who just have to fit in around them and be respectful of the fact that this is their space. If you can’t do that, I suggest you stay away – and not just from Polentina, either, but from all hospitality venues. Have a ready-meal and keep your poor manners in the one room instead. If you can share tables and be nice, however, Polentina is a place that plays on memories of Italian nonna food – stuffed things, layered things, offally things – mixed with a smattering of soups, dumplings and crepes in broth in a nod to the Austrian side of Massarella’s family. I loved a simple plate of fennel, pickled sharply, but with a good aniseedy kick, topped with some big, fat, soft, green pitted olives collapsing clumsily over the veg, and all scattered with a hint of pecorino. My favourite dish was a large pile of long-stewed, fat bobby beans draped over very good, fresh ricotta, served slightly warm, yet still singing of summer. There’s a range of excellent, if weird kombuchas, too (do try the Matka Ferments’ dehydrated strawberry and sweet cicely). As I ate my pickled fennel, another diner – at a guess, a factory worker – opened a plastic box and began devouring a homemade egg-and-salad-cream Kingsmill sandwich and a Wagon Wheel. We are a broad church. Massarella was cooking and serving alone this lunchtime, but at weekend dinners she has recently been joined by Ollie Bass, formerly of Quo Vadis and Sessions Arts Club, because at night the place caters to a bigger crowd and offers a longer menu. Regardless of that, the open kitchen currently operates with only two induction stoves and a bain-marie in a space more suited to making egg and chips. Though, I dare say, in Polentina’s hands, that, too, would be worth travelling for. Desserts were plump homemade iced lemon cookies and little tubs of Puglian lemon ice-cream from La Grotta. Polentina will get bigger, slicker and more famous, for sure, but, like the Sex Pistols’ first gig in the Common Room at St Martin’s College of Art, it’s good to experience a new thing when it’s weird and unsettling, and at the same time already altogether perfect.

I’ll grant you, there are less alluring British placenames than Slaggyford, but you’ll be hard pushed to find them. You’ll also be hard pushed to find Slaggyford itself, because it’s set in the South Tyne valley, in what’s officially Northumberland, but sort of also on the edge of Cumbria, and along a remote lane that will make your satnav go “wibble”. Slaggyford and the whole of the North Pennines are the British countryside at its most beautiful. It’s lush, green, unpopulated and largely unvisited, because its purpose to tourists is unclear. All the pretty lakes and the shops selling Jemima Puddleduck figurines have given way to brooding stone circles and “jam for sale – leave money in box” signs. As a child in Cumbria, one of our most exciting days out over this way involved an ascent by car over Hartside Pass, a long, steep climb – pure Game of Thrones stuff. The cafe at the top sold rock buns, which was the peak of excitement, until one day it burned down and that was that. If Slaggyford feels like an odd place for Parkinson, son of Michael Parkinson (yes, Parky), to set up shop, bringing his 50 years of hospitality experience, well, yes, it is. Until now, Slaggyford has not been a veal sweetbreads on pickled walnut puree or guinea fowl breast with morels kind of place. The Kirkstyle Inn has been quietly and determinedly here since the 18th century; it is the only pub for some miles around, and there is a feeling that local people have been crying out for a special venue for birthdays and anniversaries. As we arrived on a Friday night, minibuses were delivering families and the feeling that the weekend had landed. I shall never tire of seeing the power of a good restaurant bringing joy to its community. The inn has had a good lick of paint, fresh carpets, new loos and a new menu, and the word is clearly out. I nosed through recent Tripadvisor chunterings to find locals who had already been for Sunday lunch five times. There is no higher praise. Local chef Connor Wilson is serving an astonishingly reasonably priced menu, with three courses from the set menu for £30, which in this day and age feels like a misprint. His menu is ornate in places and plain hearty in others: we are served a starter of Berkswell sheep’s mousse in delicate dollops, with carefully positioned drizzles of sweet Northumberland honey and strewn with tiny mushroom caps; beef cheek comes soft, stewed and rich, with a walloping lump of creamy mash and a whole glazed carrot alongside. Likewise, there are snacks of fancy salt cod brandade piped into fingers, but also homemade pork and apple sausage rolls to drink with real ale. The inn, although refreshed and modern, is doing a nifty dance of luring in new customers, and beckoning to the likes of the Top 50 Gastropubs crowd without scaring off people who just want battered cod and chips, which one of my family inevitably always will, so I can attest that this is very good, perfectly seasoned crisp batter with chips stacked up fancily like Hadrian’s Wall, but that are still fat, fresh, home-chipped chips (they’re also available with the venison burger in a brioche roll). More discerning palates might choose the rabbit terrine or the hand-dived king scallop with fresh Isle of Wight tomatoes, or barbecued celeriac with pickled sea vegetables. Yet this is still a pub, so, if you prefer, you can order a sirloin steak with braised short rib, black garlic, cavolo nero and chips. Desserts are worth sticking about for, too: we ate a perfect raspberry souffle with vanilla ice-cream and a dark chocolate creméux with a beautifully executed tuile, boozy cherries and almonds; there’s also a cheese board featuring local ingot and darling blue that comes with date-and-walnut loaf, pickled celery and grapes. There was also a sticky toffee pudding with clotted cream ice-cream, which I am definitely having next time. The Kirkstyle Inn is the sort of pub that’s worth making a detour for. It has quietly been here for hundreds of years, and now is its time to roar. • The Kirkstyle Inn and Sportsman’s Rest, Slaggyford, Northumberland, 01434 671526.

Somewhere between the concrete scones, the sludgy, tree-bark soup and the bottom-of-a-bird-cage tabbouleh, the truth came out, though. Well, I say, “spat”, but it was actually more one of those silent, incandescent, mutual huffs couples seem to have in restaurants that involve much eye-rolling, sighing and passive-aggressive napkin-flapping. We laugh about it now – it has taken all of five years – so it felt the ideal time to dupe him again with lunch at Mallow, which recently opened a second site on Wood Wharf. Mallow, whose original restaurant is in Borough, is vegan, but very quietly so, and its intention to feed you well, but without cruelty, is carefully communicated. This is a bright, light, glass-fronted, chic, youthful modern brasserie where you can get tipsy on nori sesame old fashioneds and passion-fruit yuzu highballs, and take glamorous snaps of yourself in the bathroom. The place is from the team behind Mildreds, which has been a forerunner in British vegetarian and vegan cooking since as far back as 1988, when the vegetarian option was, by and large, chips and iceberg lettuce. If you’re a fan of Mildreds, which, with five branches in London, is still going strong, then Mallow’s menu will make your eyes spin. It is the sort of varied, plant-based, all-day, thoughtfully written list that makes my heart go boom: mung dal, shiitake miso croquettes, sweetcorn ribs, za’atar padrón peppers, pumpkin blossom, beetroot burgers, biryani, and on and on. But it’s not only the dishes themselves, it’s the drizzles, dipping sauces and marinades that come with them: whipped tahini, sour cherry molasses, kimchi, aguachile, tapenade butter, baba ganoush cream, celeriac skordalia, coconut sambol … Mallow ransacks the world’s cuisines, taking flavours, dishes and cooking styles from every corner, and makes them vegan without even saying that awful V word that so rankles some diners. For a long time, vegan signified going without, not opening oneself up to more, yet it’s hard to look at Mallow’s breakfast menu and feel short-changed by black forest chocolate pancakes, creme brulee brioche French toast or a brunch thali with scrambled tofu, almond pilaf, sambol, naan, dal and all the rest. Notably, it also offers a garlic- and onion-free menu, presumably for the allergic or Jain vegetarians, as well as for those who just can’t stick the stuff. They aim to please everyone here. Even people such as Charles, who are so overcome with small plates of sourdough with onion caramel butter, dill spinach dal and dumplings that they don’t realise the butter isn’t dairy, the “ceviche” is tomato and samphire, and that nothing has even the merest hint of spleen, valve, loin or rendered fat. I preferred the small plates to the big ones, because they’re where much of the ingenuity lies: miso-soaked shiitake mushrooms stuffed into croquettes offer punchy, umami hits and come with pickled shimeji (think small, stumpy enoki), shiso leaves, yuzu and mayo. Korean-inspired vegetable dumplings come with a sweet, feisty gochujang sauce and a pile of nicely whiffy kimchi, and a bowl of vibrant green spinach mung dal is laced with a slick of balm-like coconut yoghurt that we ate with naan. It was one of the best things I’ve eaten all year. A large bowl of fat, green, scorched padrón peppers, meanwhile, came with a memorable whipped tahini. Perhaps Mallow is so good at this type of thing because they’re not jumping on a bandwagon – mainly because, for so long, Mildreds has been the bandwagon, tirelessly working out for decades which plant product would make a nifty substitute for animal stocks and fats, and which delicious part of the world’s menus were vegan anyway. Main courses are what you could call hearty – I vastly underestimated how much biryani with pulled mushrooms (which come in dark brown, lamb-like lumps) would arrive, accompanied by plum tomato shorba, cardamom raita, cucumber sambol and an enormo-poppadom bigger than my head. A beetroot tempeh burger was equally generous, with a pile of onion rings, slaw, cherry tomato relish and guajillo chilli mayo. It was all very good, sure, but if you go big on the small plates beforehand, I’d advise you take some Tupperware. By this stage of the meal, all Charles’ memories of being underfed by vegans in Edinburgh had been replaced by being stuffed senseless on Wood Wharf. But do leave room for Mallow’s glossy passion-fruit Sachertorte with chantilly “cream”, and make space on the window sill for the business card they give you when you pay. Closer inspection reveals that you can plant it and water it, and it will grow into flowers and save the planet. That’s the thing with these vegan environmental sorts: they always have to have the last word. Mallow 12 Park Drive, Wood Wharf, London E14, 020-8050 8704.

Obviously, having watched a lot of Midsomer Murders, I suspect that, behind closed doors, Saffron Walden is in fact a virulent bed of deceit and deadly avarice, but on the surface it is plain gorgeous. Just off the main shopping area sits Church Street, a pretty thoroughfare with yet more antique showrooms, Grade 1 historic houses and, since late last summer, Chater’s, a space that does almost everything in a low-key but deftly curated way. It’s a sort of fancy cake counter/general store that sells lovely things such as bars of Land chocolate, Perelló olives and bottles of their own-label Vault Aperitivo vermouth. It also has tables where you can eat a bakewell tart or an eccles cake and sip on a cortado, or have provolone on focaccia with piquillo peppers for lunch, or, come evening time, get properly stuck into their range of vermouths, as well as homemade pastas and a range of small plates: burrata with orange zest, steak tartare and chickpeas with paprika, for instance. That’s not to say you can’t drink the vermouth earlier and order the cake nearer bedtime – the mood seems very much to say: do what you like, as long as you’re nice while you’re doing it. Max and Máire Chater have been around the London hospitality scene for years in many guises, making their names in the city’s bars and restaurants, distilling their own gin, leading walking tours around the finest drinking joints, moving into vermouth and now, along with Dan Joines, formerly of, among others, Sorella and Darby’s in south London, combining all their skills in this pretty, white-brick space in a town that’s the polar opposite of edgy east London. Even so, Chater’s definitely has about it a dose of urban industrial chic – it’s a large, airy room with few adornments aside from those nicely spaced tables, though on a Saturday lunchtime it felt very much like a cool oasis of calm. Don’t look for bells and whistles, though. There aren’t any. It’s all so perfectly curated that the quality really does speak for itself. The menu is an ever-changing single sheet, which when we visited featured fresh, warm focaccia with burnt butter that tasted like caramel, posh olives served in their tin with a fork to help yourself, and cubes of pecorino dressed with local honey and ground coffee. Yes, cheese dressed with coffee – and in Saffron Walden, too! – but it worked, with the bitterness sitting comfortably alongside the sticky milkiness, like a chewable espresso martini, but with less chance of you leaving your bra somewhere. There was also a house pork terrine with apple, fennel, figs and apricots, plus very good butter beans in an oily, garlicky dressing topped with whiffy yet delicious Ortiz tinned sardines. The vibe is simple, sometimes laughably straightforward – and always delicious. The menu at dinner gets a little more complex – featuring the likes of scallops with elderflower and pine, cumberland sausage, leeks vinaigrette and gilthead bream crudo – but not much. If this place was closer to home, I’d pop in all the time just to see what they’d sourced recently and what the hell they’d decided to serve it with, such as the salami from Sunday Charcuterie in Suffolk that comes with sourdough made in town by the Mini Miss bakery. One thing Chater’s is very good at, though they don’t make a fuss about it, is homemade pasta. Forget spaghetti, penne or farfalle: here they make luscious fat worms of bucatini and serve them in a really very decent cacio e pepe sauce. It seems that almost everyone is trying to do cacio e pepe these days, and it often tastes like gritty macaroni cheese, but the Chater’s version was the real deal and had a delightful, peppery kick. We also had a bowl of short, ridged bullets of radiatori in vodka and mascarpone sauce that was the very epitome of comfort food. We didn’t really need dessert after all that, but they had a bakewell tart, of sorts, which was really just one big, thick layer of moist frangipane studded with the odd boozy cherry almost as an afterthought (ie, the correct dimensions for a civil bakewell tart), as well as a huge, warm milk-chocolate cookie that was beautifully sticky in the middle. Charles drank a can of Vault Aperitivo negroni while I sipped a blackcurrant-leaf spritz and neatly finished off the bakewell, wondering if I possibly had room for an eccles cake, too, because it came with Lancashire cheese. Chater’s promises little and completely overdelivers. It’s possibly quite weird for Saffron Walden, but I’ll take weird over boring or leaving hungry any day.

Starters £6.95-£9.50, mains £13.75-£23.95, desserts £7.75, wines from £24.95 Being an insufferable snob is exhausting. It’s not the volume of stuff that warrants the eye-rolling or the weary sighs that take it out of you. That’s figurative and sometimes literal meat and potatoes to the restaurant critic. It’s the deep, abiding sense of impotence. For here I sit in the Chester branch of the Botanist, amid the carefully selected vintage farm implements and the distressed picture frames, staring at one of their hanging kebabs. According to the menu these are “famous”. They are certainly popular. Almost every table has ordered one. It’s quite the thing. There’s around 30cm of curving vertical rod in pewter-effect metal. At the top it’s connected to a scallop shell saucer holding a dish of dipping sauce. At the base the rod curls around to hold a wooden bowl of your chosen side dish. In between, attached to a hook, is a long, dangling skewer, in this case filled with chunks of “salt and pepper pork belly”. I’m meant to be thrilled. I should say, “Wow!” in celebration of the much sought-after Wow Effect. Instead, being that insufferable snob, I think it’s both utterly naff and utterly impractical. If you want someone’s dinner to get cold, bring it to the table swinging in the air from a hook. I was drawn to come here by an online image of a star Botanist dessert, a chocolate mousse topped with a chocolate crumb. That crumb could, if you squinted at it, be mistaken for soil. Which presumably was why it was served in a garden trowel. I looked up the Botanist. There are two dozen of them across the country, with more to come. For years I’ve ranted about food being served on things that aren’t plates. I’ve banged on about steaks on scratchy slates, whined about bread in flat caps, full English breakfasts in dog bowls, and mini chip pan fryers. My rants have been received with rapturous applause both virtual and actual; enough to make me assume I am on the side of the angels. And yet here’s the Botanist, doing a roaring trade in hanging kebabs and desserts served on trowels. I conclude that I should stop sneering from afar. I should check one out. This will give me the chance to sneer closeup. Or not, as the case may be. The Botanist is part of New World Trading, which in turn is owned by the investment company Graphite Capital. They have also invested in the Hawksmoor steakhouse group and were the company that took Wagamama from just two branches in 1996 to 70 by 2005. They are involved in companies running the likes of care homes, foster-care services and dental payment plans. It’s big business. On this Monday night, Chester’s Botanist is doing solid trade, including a party of around 30 people at two long tables. I can see why. The menu has something for everyone, even the ones dragged here against their will. There are pasta dishes and burgers, there’s a bit of Japanese, a salad or two. And famous hanging kebabs. Is it all dreadful? No, it isn’t. Gambas pil pil for £9.50 is as good as any I’ve ever had, the prawns squeakily fresh, the hot chilli and garlic oil endlessly moppable with the thick wedges of grilled bread. Curls of calamari are tender. A large fillet of skin-on sea bass is expertly cooked. And the service is a true joy. Our young waiter, Charlie, handles our every question with grace and humour, even as she has to list all the things that aren’t available. There are, deep breath, no chicken wings, no beef burgers, no steaks, no scotch eggs. Sadly, you can’t order the giant chicken piri piri kebab, or the sharing kebab. We order the prawn cocktail with “a Botanist twist”. We never find out what that twist might be. She returns to tell us that, too, is off. It’s genuinely annoying to say that so much of what we do get to try really is underwhelming. The kitchen is as devoted to sweet chilli sauce as any gospel singer is to Jesus. That belly pork kebab is meant to come with bang bang sauce. Instead, it comes with sweet chilli sauce. It makes dense, dry cold meat taste mostly of sugar. The calamari comes with crème fraîche under a lake of sweet chilli sauce, which makes the marsh of dairy look like it’s suppurating. The chips come with sweet chilli sauce, as do the chicken wings, the chicken kebab and the crispy halloumi kebab. The lovely sea bass fillet slouches over unlovely, undressed rocket leaves and desiccated half new potatoes. There’s a smear of something orange underneath, which the menu says is Romesco sauce. I’ll let the Spanish foreign ministry deal with that one. Wine is delivered in a waterlogged ice bucket, the glasses upended in it so they arrive wet. The ice bucket cannot disguise the fact that the bottle is warm, having just come off a shelf. We request ice cubes. Tragically, the dessert trowel has gone. No matter. There’s a new menu section dedicated to their “famous cookie dough”, which isn’t dough because it comes in a scorching cast-iron pan and is therefore half-cooked and weirdly grainy. You can have it many ways including as “Pornstar cookie dough”, with white chocolate and vodka passion fruit curd. I’m sure porn stars talk of nothing else. Or for £13.95, you can have the sharing cookie dough. Half a vertical birdcage arrives. At the bottom is the skillet of weird dough under insipid chocolate sauce. Above is a plate of cheap, shop-bought marshmallows on sticks, alongside more of that crap chocolate sauce. Above that are scoops of a passable vanilla ice-cream alongside a plant pot filled with what’s called Biscoff crumb, but which tastes mostly of crushed digestives. We upend a veritable K2 of crumbs on to a plate. What in God’s name are you meant to do with it? At some point, this bizarre collection of sugary detritus was given a big thumbs up by a bunch of executives and slapped on the menu. The thought depresses me. It’s not even cheap. Our bill for two for all this, including the lukewarm wine, is £120. Or am I just being pious? Later, I show a photo of the hanging kebab to my youngest, expecting her to laugh. She says, “Oh cool.” I protest. She says: “You’re just a food purist.” Shockingly, it turns out that not everybody agrees with me. Not even members of my own family. News bites Customers failing to honour restaurant bookings, or so-called no-shows, are a growing existential threat to hospitality businesses according to a new survey by Barclaycard Payments. Restaurants surveyed estimate they lose almost £90 for every person who fails to turn up without cancelling. Of the 200 businesses who took part in the survey, 18% said no-shows or last-minute cancellations had made them consider closing for good. And evidence of the pressures on the industry: chef Brian Maule has announced the closure of his Glasgow restaurant Le Chardon d’Or after 22 years. ‘Surviving through Covid, then spiralling into a cost-of-living crisis, increased home working, plunging property values, lack of support for the hospitality sector. All these damaging factors, plus many more, have weighed heavily on us,’ Maule said on Facebook. ‘We have tried so hard to see it through, for our fantastic team, for whom we feel so sorry, but also for the city that we have been part of for the last 22 years. Our business simply can no longer be sustained under all these pressures.’ But let’s end with positive news. Following last week’s report that Jeremy King is to launch a new restaurant next year in Bayswater, come reports of further ventures. According to a story in the FT King, formerly of the group behind the Wolseley and Delaunay among others, is eyeing sites for two more restaurants. One is directly across the road from the Wolseley on Piccadilly. In an email to former customers last week, he described his exit from parent company Corbin &amp; King in 2022 as ‘more of a beginning.’ He is, he said, ‘determined to be a better restaurateur, employer and friend.’ Email Jay at jay.rayner@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @jayrayner1','https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/30/jay-rayner-restaurant-review-the-botanist-chester-i-should-say-wow','Jay Rayner','CH1 2DY',-2.89024305000000003,53.1912307699999971,0.0);

AI butlers, vegan fried chicken shops in BoxParks and pop-up 1990s-themed hip-hop taquerias are all very exciting, but not if you need somewhere to host a group for a special occasion. I needed somewhere that would take a reservation and be busy enough to cope with our inevitable noise levels, yet at the same time sedate enough for everyone to be able to chat. I needed starters, mains and puddings, so dinner actually felt like a proper night out, rather than a rush job. Also, it had to be a bit fancy, but not so fancy that it ended up costing £200 a head and our conversation interrupted every seven minutes by a server reverently explaining the process by which they collect the birch sap for the dressing on the confit giant prague celeriac. If all those requirements seem somewhat outdated, it’s because they probably are. And yet, when the Wolseley Group opens a vast, marble-clad, all-day seafood brasserie serving oysters and dover sole, as well as fish finger sandwiches and knickerbocker glories, many diners will make a note, because here is a venue for all reasons. Manzi’s menu is sea-themed, and features lavish flourishes such as lobster thermidor and monkfish wellington, but if there’s someone in your party who can’t stomach fish, don’t worry, because there’s also cannon of lamb with aubergine caponata, rib-eye with cafe de paris butter and Moroccan vegetable tagine with saffron couscous and apricots. In other words, you don’t have to like palourde clams to eat here, but it helps. When I say sea-themed, I don’t mean hessian fishing nets, paintings of lighthouses or those whimsical, shell-embossed signs they sell at The Range that read: “This house believes in sandy toes”. No, I mean marble mermaids, a huge, wall-mounted marlin, a mural of Hemingway’s The Old Man and The Sea, crab-shaped cruets and a plethora of fishy fixtures and fittings adorning the door handles to the loos and the backs of chairs. In short, it’s all a bit bloody much – but I like it. Manzi’s has about it a whiff of the cruise-ship dining room, which might sound like a slight, but isn’t. It’s more the posh dining room bit you’re permitted to eat in only once a week and for which they wheel out the captain in his cummerbund and the ladies put on a “smart frock”, rather than the free-for-all buffet with a chocolate fountain and Americans pushing mac’n’cheese into their ears. For those few brief hours while you’re floating through a Norwegian fjord and eating souffle, it’s as if you’re in an entirely separate microcosm. At Manzi’s, though, you’re in fact sailing just behind Dean Street and Frith Street, so, the moment you jump ship, its elegant, twinkly spell is broken, because you suddenly find yourself slap-bang in the middle of Soho’s usual bunfight. Even so, for the few hours I was asail in Manzi’s, I rather enjoyed its Liberace levels of camp and its self-aware daftness. More than that, though, I liked the food. The cioppino fish stew was hearty, a thick, rich, fragrant base teeming with cod, moules, squid and langoustine served with grilled sourdough and a big blob of pleasingly vicious saffron aïoli. A starter of fried violet artichokes were soft yet crisp and buttery, and came with a good parsley and lemon gremolata. A bowl of steamed whelks were dressed in Sarson’s malt vinegar, specifically namechecked on the menu so no one would think they were getting that bleak “non-brewed condiment” that so many chip shops hurl about these days. Certainly, some will balk at the idea of paying £16 for a fish finger sandwich, but, having been numbed by London’s prices of late, I actually found myself gasping at just how reasonable £24 seemed for breadcrumbed haddock and chips. And a half-pint of prawns for only £14 – was I back in 2015? The ridiculous and infantilising knickerbocker glory comes in a tall glass stuffed to the brim with strawberry ripple ice-cream, meringue, honeycomb, chocolate, whipped cream and raspberry sauce. This isn’t the best food in London by any stretch, but then no one ever goes to the Delauney, Brasserie Zédel or Fischer’s for the best food in town, either. They go because these places are always open, easy to understand, bookable and tend to have a cast of what seems like thousands on the floor, all cheerily whisking you through a perfectly decent dining experience. Manzi’s is no exception: it’s just newer, with cleaner glossy marble, crabby pepper pots and a mermaid on every bar corner. If you’ve heard that this type of eating out is over, well, you’re clearly hard of herring. Manzi’s 1-8 Bateman’s Buildings, London W1, 020-3540 4546. Open all week, 11.30am-11pm (10pm Sun).

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(565,'2023-08-18T11:00:47Z','Mountain, London W1: ‘This is why we put on shoes and go out to eat’ – restaurant review | Grace Dent on restaurants','When a place such as Mountain opens, I can almost hear the grinding teeth of rival restaurateurs, because every new Tomos Parry restaurant creates a gasping hubbub that you cannot manufacture or pay for. Parry rarely appears on TV, he doesn’t have a string of cookbooks, neither does he go on tour, as James Martin does, and play Money For Nothing on an electric guitar between recipe demos (the fervour around Parry’s breakthrough restaurant, Brat in Shoreditch, would have allowed it, though). Instead, somewhere among the Basque-style turbot, the smoked potatoes and the wobbly cheesecake, diners and food critics alike developed a deep respect for Parry. It wasn’t hype, either: Brat is exemplary. Four years after opening, it is still the place to get a table, especially if you want to signal to your guest: “I know what I am doing.” And now we have Mountain in Soho, a bigger space set over two floors, with more cooking on fire, more muted, industrial-rustic decor, more painstakingly sourced ingredients such as ex-dairy beef and sobrassada. The menu is a tad more experimental, though, with Tamworth sow collar, turbot head and cull yaw chops, as well as beef sweetbreads with violet artichokes, spider crab omelette and nutty walnut bread with peach and bottarga, which is one of the most delicious things I’ve eaten this year. Would I, of my own volition, layer wafer-thin slices of ripe peach on to walnut bread and add pungent, salty, smoked fish roe? No, it sounds horrific. But the fact that it is entirely the opposite is the whole point of putting on some shoes and eating outside your own house. A salad of cucumbers, peeled, roughly chopped and served in a tangle of mountain mint and bergamot, was delicious, eventually, but initially rather odd. Never fear, though: Parry’s famous fire-smoked potatoes are here, too, all crunchy yet soft, waxy, irresistible and, if you’re not an adventurer, highly accessible. You can share four-year-old Jersey sirloin for £30 a head or, for a bit more, eight-year-old friesian beef rib, both cooked on the fire, both rare and both fabulous, especially with those spuds and Clos Culombu Corsican red at £9 a glass, although I stuck to a Botivo spritz, which is the closest no-alcohol drink you can get to a proper adult tipple in any bar right now. Mountain, of course, is in many ways not Brat: for a start, it’s in Soho, where rumours of an economic downturn haven’t touched the top echelons of ad-land and expense accounts are still being audibly or, more accurately, loquaciously rinsed. It was a Friday, and table-hopping, back-slapping and memories of Tuscany were in full swing within a metre of my fishy peach bread. I won’t wish that such people would disappear – after all, they are the customers who are keeping large, fancy restaurants serving good produce afloat, especially ones such as this, where it’s £8 for a langoustine, £26 for a plate of sweetbreads and £10 for a side of lettuce with anchovy. It’s a spacious setting in a building that was once home to Murray’s, a private cabaret club where Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies were hostesses. Now, possibly in the exact same spot where Keeler once draped herself over a Conservative minister, there is a small, in-house bakery earnestly churning out loaves, soft and crunchy in all the right places, to serve festooned with fresh cheese and raw prawns, or to smear through the oil on a plate of braised summer vegetables (peppers, carrots, courgettes, green beans). Mountain’s sheer size, however, also means it is rather loud. Eventually, the restaurant landscape will split into two groups: people such as myself who damaged their hearing in the 1980s watching Ragga Twins at Rezerection all-nighters, and younger diners with working ears who can eat their dinner in a big, echoey room without resorting to lip-reading. I shouldn’t finish without giving special mention to the dessert menu, because it’s both complex and surprising, which are two words rarely used in pudding-land these days. Ensaimada, a sweet, fluffy, traditional Mallorcan pastry, came with peaches, and do leave room for the torrija, which is essentially a slice of fried brioche-and-butter pudding with custard, and plump, glossy blackberries, or brambles as we called them when I was a child. Swimming in wild brambles we were back then; now, though, like so much fruit, they’re an expensive treat. Which may also explain why Mountain’s ice-creams and sorbets are on the pricey side, though I can say beyond doubt that they are some of the best being made in London right now. The blackcurrant sorbet was particularly mesmerising, and they also had honey melon and strawberry on that day; the ice-cream choice was olive oil, ricotta, cherry and whey caramel. In fact, on a future visit, I may well go straight to the pudding section and work my way through that, because another table’s red gooseberries with whitecurrant semifreddo caused me a fair bit of 3am sadness. Mountain is buzzy, delicious, destination dining in the middle of Soho. It’s also further evidence that Tomos Parry really knows what he’s doing.

Small dishes £3-£12, larger dishes £11-£16.50, dessert £8, wines from £29 If you decide to go to Epicurus and you probably should, perhaps when drunk, be prepared to power up Google Maps. Maybe carry a sheaf of the Ordnance Survey’s finest and a compass. Better still, go with a young person who is used to navigating the cobbled, labyrinthine mess that is the refurbished Stables Market at London’s Camden Town. In the early 80s, when I was a 16-year-old regular round here, I recall it as an architectural bin-fire of grand old red brick, fox-scented, guano-smeared ramshackle outbuildings; a superb place in which to witness Doc Marten-wearing skinheads fronting up gangs of aspiring psychobillies hot out of the nearby Electric Ballroom. Now it’s a veritable food-hatch Babylon. The air smells heavily of wok-scalded noodles and angry, indeterminate proteins slathered in soy-boosted sauces the colour of Donald Trump. There are chicken shops and waffle shops, over-stacked burgers and plant-based options, which look no healthier. If I was 16 once more, I know I would still be here an awful lot. Instead, I am 40 years older and reminded, as I often am, by the response of a conscripted soldier, temperamentally unsuited to battle, writing home from the First World War trenches: “Darling, the people! And the noise!” We traipse and we stumble, curve back on ourselves, and eventually find our way to a special kind of desolation: the vaulting railway arch that houses Epicurus, with its red-brick ceiling and outbreaks of magnolia anaglypta. It’s completely empty. Music thrums in lieu of atmosphere. One very bored looking waiter is slumped behind the bar. One very bored looking cook is poised to do absolutely nothing by the fryers. We are seated at a large table by the wall and brought paper menus so badly printed, the first column of dishes is only half on the paper. Key ingredients are unreadable. Our waiter wanders off to the far end of the room and the music suddenly doubles in volume. I beg her to turn it down. After all, we’re the only people here. She tells me she didn’t touch it; that it’s something the sound system does by itself every now and then. Happily, she turns it down. These are our first impressions. Epicurus, which opened in April, feels like an idea somebody got very excited by and then very bored with at equal speed. For a moment, we search on our phones for other nearby restaurant options. Eventually, we decide we should make a go of it. Partly, this is out of solidarity with the two stoical women here who are required to soldier on when there is seemingly nothing to soldier on for; those diligent souls who are the very backbone of hospitality, sometimes called upon to do a thankless job through the stuttering gloom. Both have suddenly come alive. Partly it’s because we have now been given a new copy of the menu. We can finally read the dish descriptions and frankly it all seems rather jolly. Epicurus is a side project by two ex-Palomar chefs, Shiri Kraus and Amir Batito, who already have a steakhouse in Camden called the Black Cow. This venture describes itself as an American diner, but one that’s been hanging out in Tel Aviv, and has picked up a distinct Middle Eastern accent. Take the Sloppy Joe, that ludicrously impractical, properly messy diner staple of sauced and seasoned ground beef in a hamburger bun. Here, it gets tidied away into a big purse of crisp, golden deep-fried borek pastry, with melty, stringy cheese. Behold the Sloppy Yossef. Obviously, you should drink responsibly at all times. But if you accidentally did drink irresponsibly, this may be the dish for you. Partner it with one of their boozy, grownup shakes: there’s baklava, honey and whisky, or banana, date and rum, and so on. You get the idea. Crisp-skinned chicken wings come slathered in a prickly, sweet-sour sauce of pickled mango and scotch bonnet. It’s like meeting an old friend who is proudly showing off a new outfit. There are salty, fried padrón peppers, with bouncy pieces of okra showered with a spice blend – cinnamon, sumac, ground cardamom and the rest – associated with the famed Jerusalem mix of grilled chicken hearts, livers and thigh sold by street vendors in the city. A huge, golden-toasted brick of brioche, has a pocket cut into it, which is filled with creamy, squeaky prawns, with a mound of whipped blue cheese on the side. Squint at it and you could interpret this as a witty take on a tuna melt made by someone who had none of the ingredients to hand. Or have the dry-aged smash burger, the mellifluously named Esh a la Golesh, topped with tzatziki, pickled onions and a deep-fried, soft-shell crab, for no good reason other than that the surf ’n’ turf textures and flavours dance as if they’re at a beloved cousin’s wedding. Oy and vey and so on. At which point perhaps you should take refuge in the iceberg salad with a remoulade dressing, then topped with pieces of seeded cracker, parmesan crisp and smoked almonds. Desserts are as ludicrous as those boozy shakes. A tightly coiled cinnamon bun is speared with shards of crisped maple bacon under a cream cheese glaze. It’s a little dense. Instead have the Messy Bamba, a sundae by any other name, in which a metal cup of dondurma or Turkish ice-cream comes mined with chunks of praline brownie, puffs much like sweet Wotsits and a chocolate caramel sauce. It’s topped by a soft peak of whipped cream, with a literal cherry on the top. Taken at one sitting like this, the effect could sound and, in some ways, really was deadening. It’s an effusive, ululation of way too much, but only because we ordered way too much, hence a bill of £140, including wine. Sometimes it’s possible to see the virtue in a cascade of dishes like this while also recognising they’re not aimed at you, or the you that you happen to be now. It’s food for a gang of younger people feeding the deep carb-calling hunger they’ve nurtured. Sometimes it’s also possible to see through the less-than-ideal circumstances. The night we were there Epicurus felt like a ghost restaurant, sailing an almost empty sea. But there’s dollops of culinary wit here and technique, and the two noble women entrusted with the all-but-empty vessel for the night really did do a bang-up job. It deserves to be full. Perhaps I am not the only one struggling to find the way into the place. News bites Let’s give a big welcome to Sharing Plate, a lovely new podcast in which people from all over the world who have made the UK their home, tell their story through the dishes which link them to their country or countries of origin.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(568,'2023-09-01T11:00:13Z','Gökyüzü, London N4: ‘There’s no chance of leaving hungry’ – restaurant review | Grace Dent on restaurants','In a bumpy restaurant landscape, Green Lanes in Haringey, north London, with its glut of Turkish-Cypriot restaurants, cafes and baklava shops, remains pretty much a constant. Anyone who has ever passed through the capital seems to have a Green Lanes story involving plates of sweet sobiyet and kadayif with mint tea at Antepliler, or a night in Diyarbakir Kitchen featuring cold Efes beers and hot mangal grills. Places round here open for breakfast and close long after midnight, and operate seven days a week, too. The Green Lanes scene may have opened up in recent years to include Kurdish and Bulgarian flavours, but its vibe remains largely unaltered: there are no frustrating tasting menus, no minuscule sharing plates, no pretension – and no chance of leaving hungry. At Gökyüzü, for instance, established in 1999, we went for an embarrassingly early dinner, imagining that we’d be eating pide and lahmacun in an empty restaurant with bored waiters and tumbleweed. But here’s the thing: Green Lanes is never really quiet. At 5.45pm on a Tuesday, Gökyüzü is in a reassuring state of bedlam: tables are full, and there are families everywhere – bring your babies, bring your mothers-in-law. Sharing platters of lamb shish, adana kebabs and chicken wings are in full swing, bowls of dressed leaves and baskets of fresh bread are being delivered to tables, while trayloads of yoghurty ayran are swept across the floor. There are 10 staff waiting tables, and at least six more behind glass counters heaving with raw skewers, cold meze and desserts waiting to go. Gökyüzü, which began life here, now has five branches from Walthamstow to Kentish Town, and is perhaps one of the flashier set-ups in the Green Lanes brigade, with a cleaner, sparklier store front, semi-romantic booths, non-wonky tables and bright, fast service. But its main selling point is the sheer sense of largesse as you enter the joint. It is impossible to walk past those glass cabinets on the way to your seat and not spy something that you’d really like hurled on to a hot grill and brought to your table, which is already littered with small plates of tabbouleh, tarama and haydari. In my case, that thing was a skewer of fearsomely large, unshelled prawns coated in a marinade that I could see from some distance was a potent blend of garlic paste and parsley. While I’m not entirely sure that Gökyüzü makes the crispest or most deftly seasoned lahmacun or the loveliest, silkiest baba ganoush in London, or even on Green Lanes, for that matter, there is a sense of theatre about the place, as well as a legacy about dining here that will make you overlook most flaws – especially if you’re dining with a crowd, because they’ll serve 12 of you without breaking sweat and won’t push to turn your table. Prices seem to have shot up along Green Lanes recently, much as they have done in every corner of the British restaurant scene, so a rather diminutive chicken shish consisting of not very much meat and served with rice now costs £17.50, whereas the larger one that might satisfy a real appetite is £22.50. Cheap and cheerful this is not. A small mixed cold meze platter, which at one point in history was a typical complimentary offer along this stretch, is £16.50, which seems a lot for unmemorable hummus, a few scoops of strained yoghurt and some pleasant aubergine in tomato. Still, those enormous garlic prawns, fresh off the charcoal, were utterly glorious, as well as an absolute car crash to shell with any sense of decorum. There’s a strong sense at Gökyüzü that they’ve seen it all, however. Staff flutter around like chipper survivors, retrieving lost babies, doling out doggy-bag boxes and helpfully adding an extra table when you’re eating with the likes of Charles, who always orders too much. “Let me help,” our server said, pushing another table close by to take the strain as a platter of lamb ribs and yet more Efes arrived, along with a second basket of lavash. Where Gökyüzü surpasses itself, perhaps surprisingly, is in the desserts, which I ordered merely out of curiosity, then ate my words spoon by spoon in the form of one of the best kunefes I have ever encountered. It was wickedly good, featuring two layers of filo filled with crushed pistachios and served warm, drowned in syrup, encrusted with more pistachios and proffered with a scoop of gorgeous vanilla ice-cream. The sutlac, or rice pudding, is also extremely good; teeth-shatteringly sweet, perhaps, but worth every damned kilojoule. Will I go back to Gökyüzü? Inevitably. It’s loud, just about always open and reliable for a last-minute large table. Even if it’s not quite changing the face of Turkish cooking, it is preserving the face of how it has looked, and it has made people in north London happy for decades. It’s not deconstructing the kebab and serving it with a playful yoghurt emulsion, but, let’s be honest, nobody needs that anyway. Gökyüzü 26-28 Grand Parade, Green Lanes, London N4, 020-8211 8406.

My ancestors in Northumbria, circa AD800, did not spy Vikings clomping hairily into Lindisfarne and think: “These guys look like people we can buy a wind chime from. I hope they’ve brought Brunsviger cake.” Yet here I am, centuries later, at Blåbär in south-west London, perusing the menu of Västerbotten cheese toasties and slices of kladdkaka mud cake, wondering why shelves of Meraki handcreams, Happysweeds umbrellas and Broste Copenhagen twisted walnut candles are so wholly irresistible. Blåbär – Swedish for blueberry – is a little slice of sedate, small-batch, Scandi-sourced loveliness, just around the back of a Waitrose in Putney. It was my second Scandi stop-off that day: I began Saturday breakfasting at Hjem, a suitably pared-back Danish-inspired cafe in the heart of genteel Kensington. Here, trailing geranium windowboxes on pristine white townhouses give way to a tiny cluster of cafes and shops, including Hjem, which is little more than a couple of shabby-chic rooms plus a small terrace out back. It serves Kiss the Hippo coffee and loads paper bags to take away from a window full of loaves, swirls and buns, including large, fat, damp, slices of drømmekage (Danish dream cake), which consists of little more than vanilla-flavoured sponge topped heavily with thick brown, buttery desiccated coconut. It may sound unremarkable and won’t win any beauty contests, but it is a delightfully moist ribsticker. Hjem’s version is particularly good. I took two pieces home, plus one of their large, ornate cardamom buns – intensely flavoured with a crunchy, sugary topping. Cardamom buns are an acquired taste: numerous pods are cracked open, steamed in milk and butter, and the resulting liquid is then used in a bread mix to create something that’s neither sweet nor savoury, but assertively perfumed. Do I like them, or are they an endurance test? Hjem’s is the hinterland between barmcake and potpourri. So, weighed down with cakes, buns and tubs of Lakrids by Bülow passion-fruit liquorice and Karamel Kompagniet bars, I made my way over to Putney for lunch. Blåbär packs an awful lot into its tiny, two-floored space. Glancing at the website – proffering soft furnishings, children’s games, jewellery, cakes and meatballs – you’d be forgiven for imagining you’re visiting a cooler, pricier, independent Ikea. No, this is a small shop, scented with pine candles and cinnamon buns, crammed with Klippan gooseye eco lamb’s-wool blankets, Martin Schwartz jigsaws and By May Stockholm teapots. There’s a cluster of tables to enjoy a Swedish handpeeled prawn salad with housemade aïoli, lemon and dill, or sip a turmeric latte. Here, the avocado toast – which all brunch spots must serve by law – is scattered with lingonberries and toasted seeds. Blåbär’s menu errs on the side of vegan, although that is never underlined. On a Saturday, the place is hectic, so eating here might not be relaxing, as shoppers mill about buying diffusers and artworks while diners eat coconut porridge with chia or gravadlax on rye. Still, I’m glad I found my second wind for lunch, because the vegan meatballs were really very good, and served on sourdough with a sweet, creamy beetroot slaw and lots of fresh sliced cucumber. Ikea cafe this certainly was not – although, if I’d wanted my fix, Blåbär does sell Daim bars, too. There are, of course, fika-friendly pastries, cakes and buns, cinnamon swirls and those amazing punsch-rolls of marzipan dipped in chocolate that look like bright green bumblebees. However, I went for a timeless classic: the chocolate mud cake. Blåbär’s is heart-shaped, and it screams, “Put me on social media!”, as you attempt to eat it with a fork, before abandoning dignity and squashing it into your mouth. Damn these Nordic types with their delightful, dignified living. They may have pillaged my ancestors’ farms, but now I have all their scatter cushions, domino sets and dream cake.

It’s there in the name – Cádiz is an ancient Spanish port, after all – and in the menu of pulpo gallego, seafood arroz and jamón Ibérico. Sometimes, when searching for the flavours of Spain in the UK, that is as good as it gets. The Spanish have been terrifically good sports about what we Britons have done to their food over the years: chopped chorizo in syrah, stiff omelette masquerading as tortilla and bowls of frozen battered squid in place of delicate calamar. We stole the word “tapas” and changed its meaning from “fresh anchovy on a cocktail stick while on a balmy bar crawl in San Sebastián” to the really rather different “sitting down somewhere in Halifax eating patatas bravas that are actually Aunt Bessie roast potatoes in sweet chilli sauce”. Somehow, the Spanish are still cordial. Cadiz, the restaurant, is not like that, though: it is an elegant dining room close to Edinburgh’s Royal Mile that serves Scottish seafood in a Spanish way. It presents itself as swanky and frankly above playing the Macarena while charging £7 for some Iceland ham croquettes, and it is. But, for all the website’s vows to nail the ambience of “latitude 36.53, where the taste of the sea meets the sound of the city”, it is an oddly un-Spanish experience. Yes, the decor features large paintings of lobsters and black-and-white portraits of gnarly Spanish fishermen, but much of the wine list is French and the cocktail list boasts the likes of From Cadiz With Love, in which Bombay Sapphire gin meets Chambord raspberry liqueur, to sip with your snacks of Scottish oysters with soy and pickled ginger, and sourdough. The menu begins with platters of Cepo de Campo Ibérico ham with manchego for £24, before quickly jaunting over to a £29 “9oz prime rib-eye steak with confit garlic”, plus optional bearnaise or green peppercorn sauce on the side for an extra three quid. The small plates (don’t call them tapas) side of the menu is similarly so French-Scottish that they should have called the place The Auld Alliance. Seafood bisque sits alongside a delightful summer chicken salad with pine nuts, and grilled asparagus with hollandaise. There are glorious, plump scallops that come with actual Spanish morcilla (blood sausage), but then we’re back to Shetland mussels with parsley and cream, and served with skinny fries. It is almost as if, in trying to please everyone and avoid the patatas bravas route, Cadiz has lost sight of Spain altogether, and instead offers up haddock and chips, lobster thermidor and lemon sole. The house paella, made with calasperra rice, pork loin, chicken and various seafood, is served only on Sundays, which seems a shame, because surely one of the whole points of going to a fancy Spanish joint in the first place is to experience good paella made properly. We made a pretty underwhelming start with the pulpo gallego, a small cast-iron pan filled mainly with hot oil, new potatoes and a dozen or so chickpeas, and we had to hunt for the ungenerous serving of thinly sliced octopus hiding among them. A large plate of sunrise-yellow, saffron-infused seafood arroz was, however, stodgily delicious and came flanked by two very good grilled langoustines and three mussels. It was a sort of budget paella for people who find wrestling a massive pan a bit too much of a commitment. The king scallops were also very good, dramatically seared yet soft to the bite, sitting in a rockpool of white wine and coral sauce with baby spinach and large, year-one catering school fondant potatoes. During my glorious reign, I shall call a moratorium on the fondant spud. The Cadiz house salad, meanwhile, was a small, damp bowl of mushy green that was fit only for a donkey, though I have been mistaken for one of those, especially when without makeup, so I suppose that’s fair enough. Hoping desperately for a slice of burnt Basque cheesecake, I asked for the pudding list only to find it offered panna cotta, chocolate fondant, salted caramel cheesecake – the inhumanity! – and raspberry pavlova, which is Antipodean anyway. The cheeseboard features picos blue, manchego and a tetilla prestes alongside some munster, Scottish oatcakes and chutney. On leaving the rather sedate, fur-coat-no-knickers Cadiz, we wandered down the back stairs and through its cheap-and-cheerful sister restaurant, Cafe Andaluz, which is unashamedly, noisily old-school Spanish. In full Friday lunchtime swing, every table was taken, the place was jolly and full of laughter, flamenco music played in the background and waiters wrestled jugs of sangria and plates of gambas pilpil, pollo al ajillo, pan con tomate and, the final insult, large pans of paella mixta that they serve every single day. “That’ll teach me to try to be fancy,” I said to Charles as we smiled weakly at a woman knocking the crisp top off her crema catalana. Next time, we eat downstairs. • This article was amended on 15 September 2023. An earlier version described Cádiz as a “Mediterranean port”, when it is on Spain’s Atlantic coast.

Our cousins over the pond have always laughed at British “fayre” – they chortle at our spotted dicks, steak-and-kidney puddings and fry-ups – and, more generally, snigger at the drab, mediocre pub grub they have to endure when they’re over here. What they rarely grasp, however, is that we guffaw right back at them, for their wasteful enormo-sandwiches, breakfast potatoes, half-and-half cream and how their national dish now seems to be deep-frozen popcorn shrimp. Even so, we Brits generally eat rather better in America, because there is a sense of largesse in the States, as well as chipper, tip-based customer service to which we’re utterly unused. It’s no surprise, then, that some of us look to recreate that feeling back home, which explains why brands such as Big Easy Bar BQ &amp; Crabshack and Sophie’s Steakhouse thrive, not to mention the roadside OK Diners where you can get a chilli and cheese hotdog with twister fries and a blue bubblegum-flavoured “Million Dollar” shake. Sophie’s is a bit more refined than that. It’s a classic US-style grill bar that’s open seven days a week and serves prawn cocktails, chicken wings with blue cheese dip and corn ribs, alongside ribeye, butcher’s cut rump and sirloin steaks. There’s a classic hamburger with a dill pickle, and a chargrilled tuna steak with avocado, and waffle cone ice-cream for afters. Sophie’s is not loud, blaring or gimmicky. It’s the genteel face of steak eating – this is Chelsea, after all – but it is breezy enough to go as a family group without worrying about making too much noise. It puts me in mind of all those faceless, run-of-the-mill, family-owned grill restaurants that I have chanced upon in upstate New York, Florida and even California. Sophie’s is not pretending to be anything new, experimental or remotely earth-shattering. Rather, it’s quietly determined to be simply “somewhere to go” when you fancy a centre cut fillet with a jug of peppercorn sauce and baked alaska for pudding. Yes, there is paprika rubbed on those very good corn ribs, and harissa in the mayo that comes with the courgette fritters, but the food is resolutely, safely unadventurous. Shockingly so, in some cases: I’d ordered the grilled sweet potato side to go with my main, imagining something baked, whipped with butter, gilded with herbs and spices, and finished under a grill, only to receive a plain sweet potato, just parboiled and grilled. It was the sort of British cooking that the Americans have laughed at for the past 20 years. Still, while nobody ever leaves Sophie’s thinking, “Gosh, that changed my life”, service is bright and swift, they throw house salami on your table when you sit down and offer buttermilk wings that are crisp, gorgeous and far too hot to eat. That tuna steak was gargantuan, which doesn’t happen often these days, and came topped with avocado, tomato and red onion. Charles’s “house fries”, which I stole following my disappointment with the sweet potato, were glorious (as stolen chips so frequently are). He ordered his ribeye rare, and it arrived as bloody as required; the peppercorn sauce that came with it, however, was oddly lacklustre, while the creamed spinach was actual spinach, not canned – which is good – but was unseasoned and drowning in an ocean of cream. The house salad, meanwhile, was fresh and generous, and featured a good, sharp vinaigrette. “If this place was next door,” I suddenly found myself saying, “I’d come here a lot.” Because, among the various duds and “what the hell?”s, there are actually some decent things to eat, such as those corn ribs, the smoked mackerel paté and the crispy squid with aïoli that provided all the oily, crunchy joy of eating at an American bar without having to shell out £450 to get to Florida. For dessert, we ordered a dark chocolate brownie that was more like a square of warm sponge cake and came smothered in chocolate sauce, Jackson-Pollocked with custard and served with a scoop of very good vanilla ice-cream. I defy anyone not to be cheered by that. I was dead set on the waffle cone, even though it’s clearly for children. But if there is any upside to ageing, it has to be the lack of self-consciousness you have about lapping a mango sorbet, letting it melt and run down your arm, before crunching the chocolate-rimmed cone right down to the point. Yes, people nudged each other and made comments, but that made it all the more enjoyable. Sophie’s does a rather more refined berry mess and burnt cheesecake, too, but that waffle cone was delicious. I had come looking for Santa Monica, but it turned out the bit I enjoyed the most was Margate pier. Sophie’s Steakhouse 311-313 Fulham Road, London SW10, 020-7352 0088.

That may sound a strange thing to say, because the entire process of visiting a restaurant requires pulling on a combo of accoutrements to make yourself acceptable to the outside world: pants, matching socks, mascara. It also usually involves a painful experience with a parking app and a table troublingly close to “other people”, whom we all by and large agree are hell. But there is a side to eating out that is rarely celebrated, and that thrives on providing a moment of comfort: the chain. Come as you are, come dishevelled, hungover, heartbroken, alone or with a rabble. We’re not going on a culinary journey; rather, this is a culinary cul-de-sac where you’ve been doing a three-point turn for the past 20 years. In fact, I’m fairly sure that, at a moment’s notice, I could step in for the 2pm-10pm shift at Wagamama, say, because I’ve been eating its yaki udon since about 1995; my order rarely deviates and my love never dwindles. Everybody needs one restaurant in their repertoire where they accept the menu from the server just to be polite. We already know that list, that font, that drinks selection. A trip to Pizza Express or Nando’s will never rock your world, but the fact that you can visualise exactly how your butterfly chicken with macho peas will look before you’ve even walked through the door will bring a moment of dependable zen to a helter-skelter day. At Wagamama, I know the swirl of the server’s ballpoint pen, scribbling numbers on my disposable table mat, and that it means fat udon noodles, wobbly gyoza and a Diet Coke will manifest themselves in about 12 minutes, very possibly for the 150th time in my life. This instils in me a sense of calm in a way that walking up the steps to a Michelin-starred “voyage of culinary exploration” simply does not. At Wagamama, I have eaten this yaki udon, on this plate and with these cheap wooden chopsticks, through a dozen stages of life. I have been young, cool and hip, dipping my gyoza in the vinegary soy dip, and I have been washed-up and 30, crying over a break-up while cramming chilli squid into my mouth. In my 40s, I retreated to Wagamama for bang bang cauliflower during death, divorce, deadlines and other personal hiccups. For me, Wagamama isn’t just for tough times, though: the branch at Westfield shopping centre, in Stratford, east London, is about 50 metres from a 20-screen Vue cinema, making it the ideal spot for carving out some clandestine “me” time. Katsu curry, a bao bun and then Barbie are an entire afternoon of big, dumb fun for about £20. Such chains offer something slightly different from cooking, too; they provide a soothing, liminal space where children won’t tantrum over “new things” and where even gran has her go-to order. Yes, there are a dozen places close to my home that serve better gyoza and noodles, and all of them have their merits; the same goes for pizza or Portuguese chicken. But we choose the chain because it rarely seriously angers us. Sure, they will have bad days – fiorentina pizza with a hard egg yolk, a Zinger Supercharger Tower meal with missing hash brown, or dry, overcooked peri peri chicken, as well as missing loo paper and forgotten desserts – but your favourite chain never truly burns its bridges. Or at least almost never – Pret a Manger has recently pushed me to the very edge of patience, with prices rising even on its watery soups and shrinkflation salads. What I find odd about this is my feeling of actual betrayal. Pret was never my friend; it has always been a steely-eyed corporation, not a cheerful, stand-in mother who owed me mate’s rates on Love bars or bircher muesli pots. Still, a sense of true companionship had definitely set in between me and Pret during the last approximately one thousand times we ate together. There was tremendous comfort in hiding in corners of random branches, eating Pret’s “proper porridge” after scattering in the little pot of pistachio, seeds and dried fruit. I sometimes also took a honey sachet, even though the rule is nuts or honey – one or the other – but Pret didn’t mind because it was my chum, so it didn’t really count as stealing. But now, as I gaze into my soup with its lonely single broccoli floret, resembling something Oliver Twist might beg for in the workhouse, it turns out that Pret was quietly planning the big grab back. Even so, I still have Greggs sausage rolls, Starbucks’ vegan Beyond Meat breakfast sandwich and even McDonald’s Filet-O-Fish, which always takes a little longer than everything else on the menu because they make it fresh. Allowing myself those extra three minutes, to ensure I get to eat something hot in a motorway service station, is often my single moment of self-care in an otherwise thankless day. I’m not at Noma now, and needs must, so I’ll take joy however it’s packaged. The second episode in the new series of Grace Dent’s Comfort Eating podcast goes live on Tuesday 3 October.

It sits on the site of a former takeaway, now va-va-voomed with pink paint and fairy lights, but there’s still only enough room to swing a small shrew without sweeping its whisker through someone’s Colombian rocoto chilli salsa. This is a sort-of Latin American restaurant – or at least the cocktails and the soundtrack are. Pineapple and jalapeño mezcalitas were on the menu when we went, alongside cachaça cristalina and velvet falernum caipirinhas, but then the pre-dinner snacks included lentil papad with plum chutney, which is decidedly Indian, albeit with a condiment redolent of my gran’s linen cupboard, which brimmed with homemade preserves. You are on a journey at Palmito. The menu is a vast scroll of text, allowing the place’s founder, Diego from Ecuador, to range through all his favourite dishes from Latin America, southern Europe and south Asia, plus anywhere else that happens to float his boat. Heritage tomato, beetroot and feta za’atar salad sits alongside nectarines with pistachio tahini, along with a scattering of fritters, spreads and relishes that wouldn’t look out of place in a 1970s Cranks cookbook, only for the pudding list to feature a spin on a home-counties eton mess. Palmito’s USP, I feel, is this jumbled yet delicious poetry, an intoxicating bombardment of 24 different small plates: on the day we went, the choice included “grilled spiced chicken thigh with turtle bean and chorizo menestra and spring greens” and “grilled oyster mushrooms anticucho with cannellini hummus and kohlrabi salad”. That nectarine, for example, came in fat slices, grilled and served with green pistachio tahini on charred endive and a pomegranate dressing, and was sweet and bitter and burnt and fruity all at once. Many dishes are vegan, so this is definitely a place to take someone who is tired of the meat-free options available elsewhere: roast harissa cauliflower with black pepper grapes or crisp celeriac masala with stuffed padrón peppers and tamarind chutney, say, should tick that box. Meat eaters, meanwhile, will find happiness in longhorn beef steak anticucho for a shockingly reasonable £15 that comes flanked by grilled potatoes and doused with Peruvian aji panca pepper paste and coriander sauce. It wasn’t all plain sailing. We’d ordered parippu moong lentil coconut dal with roast butternut squash and a flatbread, and the bread arrived 27 minutes after the dal. Together, they’d have been showstopping; separately, they were still magnificent: beautiful, silky dal with chunks of sweet squash, and pillowy bread doused with good olive oil. Does Palmito need to offer quite so many things? Probably not – they could get away with cutting the menu by two-thirds, and make it less erratic and with fewer pivots, but that wouldn’t be anywhere near as big, bold and frothy. They’d definitely serve more people, and faster, but where’s the fun in that? Palmito’s vibe is thoughtful and designed to pack as much of a punch on the plate as possible. And, right now, when your server asks, “Any questions?” the absolute honest answer is, “Yes, I have about 15, actually, but I’ve decided to ask you just to surprise me.” I drank a booze-free sangria made with red grape and orange kombucha and Three Spirit Livener and attempted, poorly, not to listen in on the rather close next-door tables. All I will say about that is: “No, it’s not a hot flush – it is warm in Palmito when the door is shut”, and “Yes, your neighbour’s daughter is in the wrong for making her evening-only wedding guests use a pay bar.” Lack of privacy will always be an issue in such compact and bijou places, but it’s clearly not hindering the footfall here, because people kept coming to the door to eye up whether we were on mains or dessert, and hoping to take our table. As our plates arrived, never predictable or half-hearted, there was a sense that each hand-dived scallop and plate of Keralan chicken had been made simply how the chef fancied it that night; that this particular concoction may well never be repeated. Palmito is ever-changing, and leans heavily on what it can get hold of, so those plums I mentioned earlier popped up in various sauces as well as in the eton mess. If you were plum-phobic, though, that night there was also a boozy, grilled banana with rum baba and banana creme. It was a little Latin America with a dash each of Lyon and Leighton Buzzard, and I wouldn’t have changed a thing. I’d love to go back, but somehow I sense Palmito will now be even busier. Palmito 16 Western Road, Hove, East Sussex, 01273 777588. Open Tues-Fri 5-11pm, Sat noon-11pm. From about £30 a head, plus drinks and service.

Snacks and starters £7- £18, mains £32-£38, desserts £8, wines from £27 If you choose to sit at the deep-varnished wooden counter of Fin Boys in Cambridge, which is the best place to sit, chef Richard Stokes may well tell you things. He’ll tell you about the Cornish day boats that supply their fish, and the WhatsApp group of skippers who ping him with news of the catch early each morning. He’ll tell you about the giant scallops they sometimes get from Orkney, the size of a Dobermann’s paw. He’ll talk about the sauces he makes from smoking and grinding fish bones, and the Asian shops a few doors down, with their stocks of dried ground scallop and shrimp for his oof and aaah of an XO sauce. He’ll tell you a lot of things. What you won’t see is the culinary burst of flame or gust of smoke. There’s barely more kit in the open kitchen behind him than there is in mine at home. Their location beneath two floors of flats demands it. There’s a four-ring induction hob, a small induction plancha and, in the corner, a sizeable oven. I point to the door out back. “We’ve got a fridge out there,” Stokes says. So both the décor and the gadgets are stripped back. And yet out of here come fish and seafood dishes which will, by turns, make you grin, nod approvingly and often just simply lean in over your plate to get on with the job at hand. It’s a curiously briny restaurant to find on a shopping parade in the heart of inland Cambridge. Perhaps they’re just working with what they’ve got. Stokes, who has the floppy fringed air of someone who is comfortable with his nerdiness, was previously the head chef at nearby Parker’s Tavern, when it was at the height of its popularity. The other fin boy is Jay Scrimshaw, who spent time cooking at both Bibendum and Chez Bruce in London. When they opened in 2021, they were more fish shop than restaurant. They pursued the doctrine of lip-to-caudal-fin fish “butchery” espoused by the Australian chef Josh Niland. He argues that fish should be treated like other animals; that the whole carcass should be used. If you want recipes for fish sausages and wellingtons, for a marlin ’nduja and a flathead mortadella, Niland’s your man. Fin Boys saw themselves as a repository of good ingredients, alongside a few pre-prepped dishes and advice. They built their relationships with those Cornish day boats and their sustainable fishing methods. They sourced bluefin tuna from a farm in Galicia; they made sure the scallops were hand-dived. And some nights each week they would become a restaurant. Three months ago, however, they scrapped the main retail business. The demand just wasn’t there. A lot of home cooks seem terrified of fish. They see fins and scales and eyes, staring back at them, and run away gibbering. Now, Fin Boys is solely a restaurant. There’s an à la carte for most of the week, and an £85 six-course tasting menu on Friday and Saturday evenings. A lot of that comes boosted with Japanese umami-rich flavours: think white soy and togarashi spice, shisho leaf and Kewpie mayo and bonito. Flavour is in the detail. Today’s lunch menu starts with a list of snacks including prawn toast. “You should have it,” Stokes says. “It’s very good.” He’s not wrong. The base is a thick slab of shokupan or Japanese milk bread, which is basically white sliced that’s been taught some delightful manners. It’s been fried until golden. The wedge of sesame-crusted minced prawn on top has been showered with furikake, that bold seasoning mix of ground seaweed and more sesame. It’s then dribbled with oyster sauce, to remind you that this is very much seafood cookery. From the list of raw dishes come deep purple lozenges of tuna, seared around their edges, with a crisp salad of shaved mooli, a dollop of cooling labne and a boldly savoury nitsume sauce made by roasting any available fish bones. Pearly slices of seared scallop lie on a bed of samphire under drifts of a bright green parsley and garlic crumb. It feels rather traditional by comparison, but in a good way. As does a heaving shellfish platter for £38. That may sound like a hefty price tag, but it really isn’t. Good seafood should never be cheap. Here’s a beautifully dressed Portland crab, the white meat flecked with finely chopped herbs. Here are shell-on prawns, big fat crevettes and oysters. The Fin Boy flourish comes courtesy of a restrained aioli, and both a hot sauce made with the iodine rush of seaweed and a more Asiatic mix of soy, ginger and garlic. We lean over all of this, tearing at shells, dipping, and dredging. Occasionally we make a pitstop at the finger bowl before returning to shove our hands wrist-deep into the seafood funk. Next up, two red mullet fillets, the skin crisply fried so it shimmers by turns rosy and golden. Underneath, is a heap of ostentatiously colourful rainbow chard in a mess of their XO sauce; a brew of dried seafood, ground mushrooms, miso and soy. It’s the sort of condiment you want to take home to meet the family, so you can all be friends. Alongside, we have a salad of tomatoes as plump as muffin tops, with roasted peaches and torn basil. It’s hinged delicately between sweet and savoury. Desserts include a summer pudding, the deep purple of a bishop’s vestments, and a Basque cheesecake. “I suspect you get a lot of Basque cheesecake in London,” Stokes says wearily, as if the capital is overrun with pastry sections so bereft of ideas all they can do now is mix cream cheese, sugar and eggs and bake it. Sometimes it does feel that way. He insists I try his and fair enough: it isn’t the deathly, drying puck that Basque cheesecake can be. It’s creamy and light and soft. At the end, Stokes passes us a tiny bowl bearing four cherry tomatoes, as if they are petit fours. “Try those,” he says. “Properly delicious.” By this point I’m really not surprised. Fin Boys is that entrancing combination of inventive cookery and seriously good ingredients. It seems at first sight to be a modest venture. The space is monkishly unadorned. But that’s because the food coming out of that minimalist kitchen is allowed to provide all the thrills and excitement and colour. It’s a restaurant driven by both an obsession with fishy detail and a profound instinct to feed. The result is completely compelling. Jay’s news bites Dan Lee, who won MasterChef: The Professionals in 2021, is to open a permanent street food outlet at Birmingham’s Hockley Social Club food hall next month, following his recent residency there. The menu at Dai Pai Dong, a Hong Kong term for an open-air food stand, will feature BBQ Szechuan lamb flatbreads, salt and chilli chicken wings and a brownie with milk miso caramel (hockleysocialclub.com). The London-based five-strong vegan restaurant group Mildreds, which opened its first outpost in 1988, is to launch two new sites next year, after having negotiated a multi-million-pound investment. MiMa, a plant-based bakery serving pastries, open sandwiches, and salads, will debut at the redeveloped Wimbledon Quarter, inside a former fire station and will have 100 seats. The second new venture will be in Victoria (mildreds.co.uk). The Hardwick, the Abergavenny restaurant of veteran chef Stephen Terry, has closed suddenly. The end was announced in an Instagram post which ended with the words “It’s been emotional. Onwards and Upwards.” Earlier this year a couple who defrauded the restaurant of £150,000 avoided a prison sentence, a judgement Terry described as “an absolute joke”. Terry, who was previously named restaurateur of the year in the Cateys, had been at the Hardwick since 2005.

Starters and small plates £9-£22.50, mains £22-£77, desserts £9.90-£11, wines from £29 To prepare for eating at the Campaner, the new London outpost of an apparently famous restaurant group in Barcelona, first look in the window of the estate agents just across the square. A two-bedroom apartment on this Qatari-funded development, which occupies what was once Chelsea Barracks, will cost you £6.65m. Spend an extra £1.35m and you can have a third bedroom. Bargain. Either way you’ll be living in a cold-edged and bleak development which, despite being finished, still looks like a computer-generated artist’s impression of itself. There are retractable bollards on the private road to keep the bad people out. There are overly cheerful doormen, loitering on the pavements. Very few lights are on. The website bears the legend: “This is your realm. Enter your private world of sophistication.” I do so love being privately sophisticated. Now turn from the estate agent’s window and look at the piece of public art a few metres away, clearly designed to give the impression that this is a space engineered for humans. It’s an enormous stylised sculpture of a hare on its knees, arse in the air as if waiting eagerly to be roundly screwed. Finally, you will be ready to confront the menu prices at the Campaner. Were you hoping for a bargain? Oh, you dear sweet thing. Just look at the place. It’s housed in a red brick edifice of vaulting arches like some Florentine nobleman’s colonnade. Oversized lampshades dangle from the ceiling, and by the door there’s a display of giant tins of caviar, alongside a basket of croissants, which have clearly been there since this morning and will still be there when we leave. Mildly annoying Latin piano jazz plays, made all the more annoying when they turn up the volume. In return for my knackered jacket, they give me a brass fob bearing the legend “007”. It almost feels like sarcasm. They bring us a bowl of what taste exactly like Sea Salt and Balsamic Vinegar Kettle Chips, and not from the freshest of bags. Behind us a 16-strong table of Chelsea’s glossy-haired finest clack into place, to pick uncertainly at small plates. The whole thing feels mildly ill-at-ease with itself. One of the menu items is listed as “Vitello Tonnato Frankie Gallo Cha Cha Cha”. I ask our waiter what it all means. She explains politely what a vitello tonnato is. I explain politely that it was the other bit I was interested in. She goes away to check. It turns out Frankie Gallo Cha Cha Cha is the name of one of the original restaurants in Barcelona. This place has been open for four months. Was that really the first time anyone had asked? And yet for all this, some of the food here is really very good. Granted, some of it isn’t. A couple of dishes make us frown and tut. But the good things are terrific. Mucking with a vitello tonnato is always risky: thinly sliced veal, blitzed tuna and caper mayo. It works. Why fix that which isn’t broken? Here it’s thinly sliced roast beef, in cashmere-soft folds, with whorls of sauce, rather than rivers, and huge fat caper berries and tiny crispy capers. It is both soothing and exciting. Four darling little scallops arrive in their shells, perched on dollops of a very good romesco. They are the Maybachs of canapés, with go-faster stripes. It costs £17.50 for four mind, but, my love, what price beautiful things? I am so excited by those two dishes that I wantonly order their “spicy sausage rolls”. Meagre nuggets of fatty, cumin-spiked sausage on a stick come wrapped in a claggy batter that has then been deep fried so it’s puffy and brown. Are corn dogs a big thing in Barcelona? Should they be? We don’t finish them. In the middle of the menu are some fearsomely priced big plates: lobster with hollandaise and caviar for £77; a lobster and monkfish casserole for two at £70 a head, which comes in two services. Eat the lobster and monkfish, then they’ll take away the broth, add some poached eggs and bring it back to you. There are also rice dishes for two, including a Catalan “socarrat” with red prawns at £38 per person, or £76. That’s £85.50 with the ever-present service charge. Save up and come here for this alone and pretend it’s good value, because it is an absolute belter of a dish. It’s served in a monster truck hubcap-sized paella pan that befits the price tag. The rice, mixed with deep orange mussels and a fine dice of cuttlefish, has been cooked down in a broth made in part from the heads of the lobsters already served to the wealthier people seated over there, until it is almost dry and sticky. Our waiter scrapes at the base of the pan in a studied manner to portion it out. A socarrat describes the crisp, crusty layer at the bottom of a paella and this isn’t that, not quite. But it is still a hugely satisfying rumble of deep seafood flavours. The red prawns on top are also perfectly cooked. After we are given the first portion, we are left to serve ourselves. And finally, we can relax into the mood of the Campaner, Latin jazz and all. This dish really is the whole point of it. The dessert menu includes Basque cheesecake, but then you knew it would. A lemon pie is a restaurant service-friendly crisp tart case, filled with sharp lemon curd and topped with peaks of torched meringue. It pretty much works. A chocolate soufflé really doesn’t. It’s halfway to being a chocolate fondant, but not a very good one of those either. The wine list is short and quickly excruciating which is, of course, as you would expect. I am being abstemious tonight and so have a mocktail of lime, syrup, tonic, soda and angostura bitters. It costs £10. I try not to think about the markup on that. The Campaner means the “bell ringer”, and references nicely the restored Garrison Chapel across the square. The restaurant is clearly trying to establish itself as a community hub for a very particular silk-socked community. Those ageing croissants are part of a breakfast menu which includes a full English for £20, or porridge for £11. With just one glass of English fizz, our bill comes to just shy of £200. We walk out into this new and deserted housing estate for scared wealthy people. I look up at the kneeling hare. I swear the damn thing winked at me. News bites In far-flung news, Simon Rogan of L’Enclume in Cumbria, is to open a restaurant in Phuket, Thailand. The Thai version of Aulis, which serves just 12 at a chef’s counter, will be part of the Iniala Beach House luxury resort in Phang-nga. Rogan says they intend to use local produce and native ingredients and work alongside the area’s farmers. The new venture joins another by Rogan on the island of Malta, which is also in partnership with Iniala. Yum Bug which, as the name hints, offers animal proteins made from insects, is launching a pop-up restaurant to promote its products. The restaurant, in London’s Old Street, will operate from 26 October to 11 November, Wednesday to Saturday, and will have a menu of dishes created by a number of partner chefs. Sam Clark from Moro has come up with hummus topped with cricket mince, while Tim Molemo, head of food at Nando’s, is using the cricket mince in a flatbread with pomegranate and onion (yumbug.com). A lawsuit in New York accusing both McDonald’s and Wendy’s of misleading diners over the size of their burgers, has been thrown out. A judge ruled that he had not been shown proof that either company delivered smaller products than suggested by their advertising. The company’s efforts to make their food look appetising was, Judge Hector Gonazlez ruled, ‘no different than other companies using visually appealing images to foster positive associations with their products’. The ruling could have implications for similar cases being brought against a range of brands, including Taco Bell, Buffalo Wild Wings and, as reported here a few weeks ago, Burger King.

In fact, perhaps my entire restaurant career can now be divided into a time before Tantra, when life felt simple, and a time after, when all other dining experiences are merely pedestrian. Tantra describes itself as “elevated” Indian cuisine, and the front of the building has the word “PROGRESSIVE” emblazoned across it, maybe as a warning to hang on to your pants, because these guys really mean business. It’s not an eatery or street-food joint; rather, it is “a streetery”. It’s also a cocktail bar that serves the likes of a Queen of the Dragon, brimming with Midori, Cointreau, prosecco and something called “perfume myst” that comes with a lime-flavoured replica dragon’s tail poking out of a cloud of dry ice. Tantra loves dry ice, and it never knowingly misses an opportunity to open a cloche and waft some of the stuff your way, leaving you in a mysterious fog and resembling a Hanna-Barbera villain. The Peacock Pistachio, meanwhile, turns up on a glass tripod and is garnished with “mamam” jelly and faux peacock feathers. Those are two of the more casual, everyday cocktails. I no longer drink alcohol, but by God I wanted to, if only to force Tantra to make at least some sense. The place is as cavernous as an old-school The Hitman and Her-style “niteclub”, painted mostly black and with an interior design theme fever-dream that could be more accurately described as Funkadelic-era George Clinton. There are flashing neon blue lights, patches of plastic greenery hanging from the ceiling, paisley wallpaper and mirrored walls. “Are you ready to order?” a server asked. “No,” is what I wanted to reply, “I shall never be truly ready, because I’m still trying to process everything I’ve seen in the last four minutes and my brain’s computer needs a full NVRAM reset. Also, your menu has approximately 68 dishes on it, and I have no idea what “Fuchka Xplosionz” or “Bone Marrow Canoes” are. Also, neither do you, because it’s your first day here, you poor thing, so let’s just go gentle into this good night together.” We ordered a round of lassis, which came in ornate goblets and tasted like butterscotch Angel Delight, so were therefore utterly marvellous. Less modern streeteries might at this point have offered some poppadoms, but Tantra furnished us with a “crisp board … with progressive regional dips”. This turned out to be seven shards of poppadom in various colours, one of them luminous green, that were plated on blobs of pickle and raita, so some of them had gone soggy. “Tantric lamb cutlets” came next, and were so called, I think, because the chops had had a long, hard session under a hot grill and were extremely well done. Like almost everything at Tantra, they were served on a black plate with a flamboyant garnish, in this instance a roughly 30cm-long sprig of rosemary, which is about the amount of foliage you could get away with on a fascinator at Ascot. At no point during lunch did I have a clue what was going to happen next, and I loved every second of it. These people are true mavericks. Sure, the venison sheesh wasn’t too exciting, but it came on a slab of black slate and sitting on vivid smears of beetroot glaze, all festooned with large non-edible flowers, puddles of ginger chutney and half a dozen parsley garnishes, so that was novel. The curries, on the other hand, came with far fewer bells and whistles, and were really rather good. Duck chettinad was fragrant with ground coconut and black pepper, and packed with generous slices of nicely pink duck breast. Makhani saabat maanh turned out to be dal makhani with a real kick of ghee, garlic, cream and cardamom, while the dum hyderbadi gosht biryani was light, golden and delicately spiced, and far too dainty to eat while listening to a loud remix of I’m Good by David Guetta. The folk at Tantra really love sizzling plates, and are never happier than when they’re whizzing something past your table that might feasibly set your eyebrows on fire. All very exciting, I know, but I draw the line at the “sizzling chocolate brownie”, which was more a stale lump of cold brownie on a red-hot dish on to which the poor server was then contracted to pour boiling hot chocolate syrup. As a result, the entire plateful quickly set into an inedibly coagulated fire hazard. “We’ll have the bill now,” I said through very small lips.

There was once a restaurant/llama petting zoo on the A66 near Penrith called the Llama Karma Kafe, where you could eat a jacket potato with tuna mix just metres from a crowd of these furry beasts, but sadly the place has long since closed. Equally sadly, Llama Inn in Shoreditch is nothing like the Llama Karma Kafe, either – there’s not a slice of bakewell tart or a domesticated camelid in sight. Instead, it is a “cool” Peruvian restaurant down an alleyway, then up a lift and on to a Hoxton rooftop. You’d never get a llama in that lift, by the way; it’s far too small: the cool kids with their big shoes and oversized jackets have to take it two at a time. Llama Inn first opened in New York in 2015 and has now set up shop in London, serving anticucho (stuff on skewers), various types of ceviches and sliders, as well as its signature lomo saltado (stir-fried beef with spring onion pancakes and pickled chillies). The menu is inspired by south American and Peruvian tastes, so expect ají rocoto pepper, choclo corn and caucau (tripe stew), but there’s also a heavy Nikkei undertone, with dishes dressed in furikake seasoning and yuzu kosho. In brief, everything at Llama Inn is memorable for one reason or another. You’ll be bombarded with sweet, sour, soy, mayo and nutty umami pastes at every turn. Sometimes they are lovely, at others quite puzzling, but at all times they will be expensive, because you’re in Hoxton. One tiny skewer of octopus, potato and capers is as big as my index finger and costs £9, plus service. A small pile of quinoa containing chopped bacon, banana and avocado is £13. One of the most expensive dishes, the lomo saltado, is £56. For a restaurant that arrived with such a clear idea of its hip, New York identity, however, this is an understated, pale, mature dining space. I came here a few years ago, back when it was an Italian restaurant, and this time I could barely spot anything by way of refurbishment, although I’m certain money must have been spent on it. The music is much louder, though, and features more Chaka Khan and Mos Def, while the cocktail list now offers the likes of YaYo hipsters with Japanese gin and vermut rojo as well as something called a “chupetini – make it a supertini”, which has Japanese gin, dry vermouth, an “umami bomb” and a blue cheese olive. They made me a no-alcohol, sort-of-Japanese-style sangria garnished with banana leaf, which was very pretty. Service was lovely, though we must have had at least six different servers over the course of our meal, and each one told me to remember that everything was designed for sharing. That’s as may be, but it’s actually quite hard to share Llama Inn’s crispy squid ceviche, which is essentially deep-fried squid rings with a sweet, corn-based sauce. Or its zucchini caucau, which is a bowl of soup with a roll. Have you ever shared a bowl of soup and a roll with another human being? You’d have to know them extremely well indeed. At Palmito in Brighton, which I reviewed a few weeks ago, I witnessed an act of open rebellion from one table of four diners, who, when told that “everything was for sharing”, replied: “We don’t want to. We don’t like sharing.” This is how revolution feels, I thought quietly to myself while dividing a dal into two portions. I should add that both the sauce with the squid and the caucau were genuinely very good indeed. As for the star attraction, that lomo saltado was peculiar. It’s a Peruvian take on a Chinese beef stir-fry, with a handful of meat fried to well done and served in a soy-based sauce with some oyster sauce and beef broth, plus, at a guess, five large spring onions. Some of these were chopped and thrown over as garnish, and others were semi-fried in large chunks and left floating in the sauce, which tasted mostly of dark soy. The entire merry mess was garnished further with a Jackson Pollock of vivid orange mayo and served with spring onion pancakes, rice and chips. We foraged for the beef on that vast, spring onion mountain. The chips were very good, though. Freakishly good, in fact: thin and french fry in style, but triple-cooked and crunchy. World-class chips. The pancakes weren’t great, though. If I sound a bit confused by Llama Inn, I am, as will probably everyone who goes there. After a matcha tart with a fridge-cold pastry base, I paid the £170 bill and left, saying: “Parts of that were genuinely innovative and delicious, and the staff were so nice. I’d even go back if someone else was paying.” Form an orderly queue with your Coutts cards, everyone, though you have to like sharing plates – and spring onions.

Or the merits of textured vegetable protein, or whether vegans should use the word “pork” when many seem to think it should be saved strictly to describe bits of actual pig. These vocabulary purists will, for instance, be wildly irked by Bonsai’s Hanoi “pork” spring rolls. Because guess what? They don’t feature pork at all! Rather, they’re made with fruit, egg-less cream and a layer of deep-fried rice paper, all of it teetering taste-wise on the edge of porky, but actually more a cacophony of non-sentient items styled into a punchy, umami hit. It’s absolutely bloody delicious, too. Bonsai began life as the pop-up BangBao, which used to sell vegan bao but has since grown into a full-scale, award-winning, sort-of Japanese, Thai-influenced and deeply experimental bricks-and-mortar restaurant. It resides in a cool, elegant, black building down a side street, and the interior features polished benches, lacquered tiles, glass bricks, tasteful neon signs and music I’d describe as house. A woman of my vintage trying to pinpoint any modern dance music genre always sounds confused at best, but this stuff was fast enough to make Charles and me crave a visit to a nightclub, before breaking into peals of laughter. Imagine! They open so late. I already regard anyone who books a 9.30pm table for dinner as the perpetrator of an open act of aggression. All of this – the music, the dragon mural, the general decor, the wild food – could make Bonsai feel a bit intimidating, but never fear: its secret weapon is its staff, especially front-of-house Amy Bennett. In her hands, it feels almost cosy, even when the menu arrives on what looks like a betting-shop slip on which you’re meant to write your order yourself and pass it back. You can put a tick beside the “chef’s selection of pickles” line or the bánh mi sliders made with crisp “chicken” that costs “7¾”, which I cleverly guessed meant £7.75. The menu splits into small plates, things from the bincho grill, their “classic” bao buns, rices and sides, plus a few daily specials: on the day we went, there was bincho-grilled paratha with curry butter and spring onion oil, and a couple of desserts, including a passion-fruit cream. Bonsai, with chef Dom Sherriff at the helm, is definitely remarkable and unusual; it is also a warning shot for any johnny-come-lately restaurant hoping to cater for a more diverse audience that thinks a drab risotto is enough to wow meat-avoiding punters. God knows, in recent years I’ve been giddy enough over a salt-baked celeriac or a spruced-up jerusalem artichoke, but here they serve “yakitori chicken” made with those pieces of weirdly chickeny non-meat that are becoming more realistic with every passing year; they’re coated in togarashi and sesame, and cooked over posh Japanese binchotan charcoal until almost blackened. Bonsai isn’t all about reimagined meat, by the way. There is also barbecued cabbage and chunky corn on the cob, fired until charred yet still sweet and juicy, and served with something that’s very buttery and what tasted very much like grated parmesan but absolutely wasn’t. There are Sussex-grown mushrooms in tempura, and a fantastic som tam made with pounded sour mango, cherry tomatoes and coriander, which I demolished. The greatest joy here, however, is the sheer attention to detail. If you order a side of kimchi, you’ll get a really good, crisp, funky kimchi that’s sweet and astringent in all the right places. If you order the aubergine on skewers, worrying that you’ll possibly end up with sad lumps of what seem like washing-up sponge, as is often the way with barbecued aubergine, fret not – what arrives comes scorched and glossy with miso, maple syrup and wasabi. Mixed vegetable gyoza are finished with a blowtorch, served caramelised side up and dressed in Sichuan chilli oil with crisp garlic. One of the biggest compliments I can give any restaurant is to say that it is like nowhere else. Bonsai is a place for vegans to take non-vegans and open their minds, or annoy them with inverted commas and fake Mongolian lamb until they never speak to them again. Here, the former is far more likely. This place is special, and you’d have to be a pretty dour-faced “foodie” not to find happiness in it.

Starters £8, mains £18-£19, desserts £8, wine from £20 a carafe The Small Canteen is not a restaurant for claustrophobes. The name isn’t whimsy. It’s an accurate description. It’s a room in which to eat and it’s very small. The business occupies a flat-roofed, oblong block on a residential corner in Newcastle’s Sandyford. There is a big green and gold painted sign across the top of the building and that is possibly the flashiest thing about the place. If you want the loo, they’ll direct you out the door on to the street and round the corner. On a rainy Newcastle night, it might be best to go before you arrive. Inside, there is room for 15, in a way which some might call intimate, others an invasion of privacy. Then again, this space used to be a sandwich shop and those are rarely built in ballrooms. The tables are solid lumps of scrubbed-down old wood, which I’m absolutely sure were not reclaimed from a skip. The compact menu, which changes daily according to what’s available, is written up in multi-coloured chalk on a blackboard, in an enthusiastic hand. And it is, of course, all bloody marvellous. The Small Canteen serves big food, in the classic bistro tradition; the dishes are rich and generous and designed to get you through the night and a few of the following days, too. The scene is set by the dips that await you at the table, on a Small Canteen monogrammed plate: a tricolour of deep green salsa verde, sunset orange red pepper purée and an-off white aioli. All of them boast proper depth and power. Take a photo of the menu because it’s on the wall behind you, then, while you study it, get to work on those dips with the hunks of accompanying bread. Just beware. There’s more coming. A lot more. It’s all the work of Sam Betts, an experienced chef who came out of Covid wanting to do his own thing. He could be called the head chef, but as he’s the only person at the stoves, he’s just the head of himself. There’s a strong sense he very much likes it that way. Tonight, there’s one person out front taking the orders, doing the carrying and clearing, and another chap on pot wash. There isn’t room for more. As there are just three starters, two mains and two desserts we order it all because it’s priced to encourage that sort of behaviour. The starters and desserts are all £8. The mains are around £18. A double-cooked cheddar soufflé is springy and light and served in a lake of chive-flecked, cheese-boosted béchamel. Around the rim the cheese sauce has become crusted and brown and is demanding to be scraped at. It reminds me of the heart-stopping soufflé suissesse at Le Gavroche, only one that’s started hanging out with a rougher crowd and learned some delightfully louche manners. A confit pork terrine is served at a perfect room temperature. It’s in a slab the thickness of a big Stephen King novel. There are bursts of pistachio green among the meaty pink and on the side there’s a relish made from pickled walnuts. Betts has clearly spent a lot of time learning the craft of the terrine. The third starter is a golden trio of smoked haddock croquettes in a panko crumb, accompanied by a rough-hewn tartare sauce. We begin to worry a little about how much enthusiasm we put into dispatching those dips. For here come the main courses, like aircraft carriers cresting the horizon. The braised beef cheek clearly originated with a proper-sized beast. It is fork-tender and slumped on a duvet of mash that is not shy of the horseradish with which it has been impregnated. Because Betts doesn’t do restrained there are also roasted shallots and slabs of smoked bacon as if it’s a boeuf bourguignon that never got properly disassembled into its various parts. Obviously, there is gravy. Lots and lots of gravy, for this is Newcastle and they wouldn’t have it any other way. The other main is three silky ravioli, each the size of saucers, stuffed with a smooth butternut squash purée and dressed with toasty beurre noisette and pine nuts. Alongside is a brightly dressed salad, because leaves are in order. If I have a doubt about any of this, it is not for the customers, but for the business. The portions really are quite challenging and the pricing does not seem to reflect what’s gone into them. For the same price, that terrine could be the thickness of a novella rather than a blockbuster and nobody would feel short-changed. It would still be the edible equivalent of a major page-turner. The peak of the beef cheek dish could be a few inches lower and again nobody would complain about having less of a summit to scale. It’s exemplified for me by our wine choice. It’s a lovely, smooth 2021 gavi di gavi from Villa Casetta. It’s up on the blackboard at £26 alongside two similarly priced whites and reds. It retails for between £18 and £20. Of course, we are meant to celebrate good value, but for God’s sake, Sam, this is no way to do business. The Small Canteen is one of the good places. No. It’s one of the great places. It needs to survive. And so to the desserts. There is a wedge of raisin and apple cake with the lightest, most acutely judged waft of saffron. It is both homely and accomplished; the thing your favourite auntie, the one who knows how to bake, gets out when you come round because she is pleased to see you. It comes with mascarpone ice-cream. Or there’s the panna cotta, set in a glass tumbler. A slab of seedy nut brittle sticks out of it. On top are the sweetest of blackberries. And, of course, they are huge specimens, the biggest blackberries I have seen in a long while. It would be a lie to say that any of this was truly surprising. It was Betts himself who brought the restaurant to my attention, with an emailed photograph of one of his messy blackboards. It just seemed the kind of place I would like. But I hadn’t quite bargained on it being such a joy. In a restaurant world that too often celebrates the big and the dramatic and the glossy, it was delightful to find somewhere so damn pleasurable and so at ease with itself. The obvious should generally be avoided but it has to be said: the Small Canteen is a restaurant with a huge heart. News bites A 4,000-strong Facebook group for self-declared food, booze and music obsessives called the Porky Punk has, after a dozen years of sharing hungry ideas with each other and just happily wasting time online, spawned a book. The Porky Punk Annual Manual, published by hospitality industry veteran Mark Souter, who founded the group, has a foreword by cook and broadcaster Andi Oliver and more than 80 recipes, alongside stories celebrating pickling, fermenting, preserving, micro dosing and a whole bunch of other stuff which may or may not be relevant. Copies are available to buy here. My annual reminder that fundraising by Streetsmart, which invites participating restaurants to put an extra £1 per table on bills to help alleviate homelessness, is in full swing from now until Christmas. According to the most recent figures, homelessness has risen 12% since before Covid. More than 560 restaurants in 24 cities across the UK are involved this year and they hope to beat the £786,000 raised in 2022. For a full list of participating restaurants, visit streetsmart.org.uk. Big business update: the Asda Group has become the owner of “natural fast food” company Leon, which originally launched as a plucky competitor to high-street fast-food brands. Asda has bought EG Group’s business in the UK for £2.07bn, which includes Leon. The brand had already started running coffee kiosks in various of Asda’s supermarkets and will now be fully rolled out across the estate (leon.co).

Ilona Rose House, anyone? The name hardly rolls off the tongue, does it, but it describes the many thousands of square feet of land more or less behind Greek Street that consists of work spaces, art installations and, more relevant to this column, a mews with alfresco dining. You enter via an archway on Greek Street, or via the equally new, spangly, hyper-modern Tottenham Court Road station, although right now you’ll still be treading through building sites, cooing at foxes cavorting in rubble and basically wondering: “Where the hell am I? None of this seems to be on the map.” The developers have chucked just about everything they can at IIona Rose House to prettify this mega-priced patch of grade-A real estate. Milk Beach and Kapara opened here last year, and now there’s Daroco, a 120-seater Parisian import that serves fancy pizza, titivated pappardelle and hyped-up tiramisu. Yes, it may be selling mainly just pizza and pasta, but Daroco does so in a wildly ostentatious and unforgettable manner that I’m going to call acid art deco with a renaissance edge. Velour gilt banquettes perch under a mirrored, pleasure palace ceiling, and there are lots of plants, lots of brass, lots of staff in navy blue and an enormous disco pizza oven decorated with a whole flock of blue butterflies. Minimalist is clearly a filthy word to the Daroco people. Here, more is most definitely more. Downstairs there’s a spacious, equally ornate cocktail bar called, rather bizarrely, Wacky Wombat. At Daroco, the website says, architect Oliver Delannoy “sets the stage by imagining a more than monumental identity”, an identity that has already been a great success in both the 2nd and 16th arrondissements of Paris due to the vision of owners Alexandre Giesbert, Julien Ross and Nico de Soto. The trio behind those ventures now find themselves in an area of London that’s only just awakening after a decade under dust covers. It’s mere moments from the Outernet, a space where tourists now linger in their thousands, lured by the Vegas-style wraparound screens that blare out music all day long. I’m sure all that gawping will make them fancy a bowl of spaghetti alla chitarra with baccalà, cured sardines with sweet-sour white onions and pine kernels, or chocolate mousse served very much French-style in a lovely, aerated, gelatinous lump and garnished with big pinch of sea salt. I can’t help but be rather enamoured of Daroco. It’s silly, yes, but it’s fun, to quote the title of my favourite episode of The Good Life. In this gig, I must eat pasta in a safely decorated, somewhat pale room at least 20 times a year, so it’s a real treat to have Daroco channel Michelangelo’s St Peter’s basilica while bringing me ravioli filled with braised pheasant served in a butter and rosemary sauce. After all the bluster, I was expecting very little from the food, but I’ll eat that cynicism immediately: this was a more than decent lunch. First, that big, blue and ridiculous pizza oven is churning out possibly the best pizzas in Soho. These are huge, sloppy, soft-based and floofy-edged, and made with good-quality produce at more or less the same price as the nearby Pizza Express. The “parmigiana” with tomato sauce, fried aubergine, stracciatella, grana padano and basil is very good and serves two. The “mortadelight” is littered with fior di latte mozzarella and comes with mortadella, more stracciatella, a rather wondrous pistachio cream and crushed pistachios. The arancini are plump, crunchy-coated, stuffed with well-seasoned braised leeks, scamorza, hot peppers and pecorino, and pretty much as good as arancini get. An antipasti of marango beef, sliced thinly and served raw, is dressed with good-quality olive oil, sea salt, lemon and a side of pane carasau, or Sardinian “sheet music” crispbread. Yes, this is a vast, daft restaurant in the heart of tourist land, but it’s also much better than it needs to be. I felt similarly about Milk Beach next door. Such restaurants are the only things saving this Soho facelift from being wholly awful. As well as that mousse, we had the tiramisu for pudding, a generous, unregimented stack of espresso-soaked savoiardi biscuits and mascarpone splodged dramatically in a bowl, with no sharp corners and almost like a trifle. A new mode of presentation, perhaps, but still the same old comforting, boozy, spongey, creamy, dinner-party classic. The staff are lovely and the menu isn’t that pricey, considering where it is. Leave your family staring at the 50m screens playing Beyoncé and treat yourself to a Napoli pizza with capers, white anchovies and taggiasca olives with a £6 glass of montepulciano. Central London is befuddling, but there is some wonky sanity at play here. Daroco Ilona Rose House, Manette Street, London W1, 020-7348 4998.

Always the same but, oddly, always evolving, too – I’ve been treating myself here for at least 25 years. Claridge’s is the doyenne of classy, pricey metropolitan hotels. It is Audrey Hepburn eating a caviar blini while wearing a tiara, with crunchily expensive carpets, top-hatted doormen and a delightful art deco ladies’ bathroom. Post-pee, an attendant beckons you to a mirrored dressing table to powder your nose. All this bling remains constant, but in other ways Claridge’s isn’t afraid to change, particularly in its main dining room, where in recent years it’s said hello and goodbye to Simon Rogan’s esoteric food journey at Fera, followed by a warm embrace for Daniel Humm’s Davies and Brook, a sibling to New York’s Eleven Madison Park, although he, too, packed his cases pretty quickly. Creative differences, they said: Humm wanted to turn the whole menu vegan, and Claridge’s didn’t share his vision for multiple courses of petals, flora and parsnip shavings. So what for Claridge’s Restaurant now? Well, something rather revolutionary, actually: it has been reborn as a straightforward restaurant with a low-key chef and serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. Claridge’s describes itself as British, and the short new menu is full of unchallenging yet pleasing terms such as steak au poivre, baked alaska, chocolate souffle tart and roasted Norfolk chicken. It’s not pommes puree, it’s mashed potatoes, and no one has deconstructed that chocolate tart either. The most challenging offering to a picky eater is the beef tartare with a confit egg yolk and bone marrow. Starters such as black truffle crumpets and goat’s cheese and pear salad are clearly marked as the “first course”. With its sheer simplicity, the new restaurant’s identity is spelled out in all the things it doesn’t do: it doesn’t have a pretentious one-word name, it doesn’t make you guess what the dishes actually are by listing only their component ingredients, it doesn’t proffer a vertical list of 20 sharing plates at various prices and make you work out what might make a proper dinner, nor does it keep you there for so long, while forcing you to eat 16 courses, that you feel imprisoned. No, here you’re whisked back in time and across the mosaic floor while savouring art deco flourishes and fabulous pendant lamps. Coo at the Calacatta violet marble and the antique brass, perch your bottom on a leather banquette, then order a leek and watercress velouté with a mini parker house loaf that comes with a small pat of Claridge’s embossed butter, because of course it does – it’s Claridge’s. If you want to ooh and ah over a menu, go to Ikoyi or Mountain; queue in the rain for a Supernova burger or for Mystic Burek. The capital is teeming with groundbreaking, puzzling, horizon-expanding dining experiences right now, but none of them is happening in here. Instead, Claridge’s is a jocund, elegant time over a plateau de fruits de mer that features a feast of fine de claire oysters, fat langoustines, crab, clams, mussels and scallops. It’s £45 for one person, and for another £30 you can add half a lobster. They’ll bring an assortment of prodding, scooping and cracking devices, which will feel oddly formal, but, importantly, they will pretend not to notice if you don’t use the correct ones in the right order. The seafood is beautifully dressed and, with such a small menu and rapid turnover, notably perky and fresh. In the event of another world war breaking out, some people say they’d head for the kitchen department at John Lewis and live out their final hours fondling Le Creuset ramekins, not least because it is the ultimate safe space. I agree with the sentiment, but all things considered I think I’d now go to Claridge’s Restaurant, after first spending a penny in London’s loveliest lavs, handing my coat to the wonderful reception staff, accepting the pretty token they’d give me in return, before settling down with a bowl of pumpkin agnolotti – a hearty, sunset-shaded bowl of fresh pasta with chunks of baked delica pumpkin and shaved black truffle. I’d follow that with the grilled Cornish turbot with sauce nantaise, which is basically a more creamy take on beurre blanc laced with smoked caviar. With it, I’d take a side of buttered french beans with meyer lemon, some of those buttery mashed spuds in a small black earthenware pot, and maybe the glazed garden carrots, too, because they come on a carrot puree. For pudding, I’d have the baked alaska for two, which the staff will set ablaze for me because it always brings out the child in me. If I’m going to watch the world burn, I may as well begin by doing the same to my pudding. Claridge’s never truly changes, but there’s enough happening now to keep me curious. I’m set for another 25 years. • This article was amended on 25 November 2023. An earlier version had its fauna and flora mixed up. This has been corrected.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(590,'2023-12-29T12:00:04Z',' ‘Where chefs let their freak flag fly’: Grace Dent’s favourite restaurants of 2023','While I was eating smoke-infused Indian small plates at Khai Khai on the Quayside in Newcastle, a curious thought occurred to me: 2023 seemed set to be the year that London’s restaurant scene lost its edge. Outside the M25, I was eating far better. I was midway through a plate of broccoli so charred I wrote that it looked as if it had been “chipped from Pompeii’s pavement”. The florets were festooned with pistachio, micro-greens and chilli. It was a Thursday night and the place was heaving, with queues out of the door. Gordon Ramsay had been in that month to sing Khai Khai’s praises. Oh, and Harrison Ford, too. Things used to be more straightforward: even if Michelin fixated on Cumbria, London’s restaurant landscape was always a touch slicker and more innovative. You would eat better in Soho than in Solihull, or in Mayfair than in Macclesfield. But costs, Covid and other calamities have made London a less easy place to experiment. Meanwhile, in south-west Scotland, say, at both Mr Pook’s in Castle Douglas and Home in Dumfries, I found delightfully odd, fiercely unique places where chefs can let their freak flag fly. At Mr Pook’s, that meant panko-wrapped Dullarg duck eggs and marmalade bread-and-butter pudding with rum-and-raisin ice-cream, while at Home they served Angus steak with a side of fried lasagne. For the rest of the year, anywhere but London continued to deliver. At Beckford Canteen in Bath, one of my openings of 2023, I ate a chocolate and jerusalem artichoke pudding, after a dinner of welsh rarebit with pickled red onions draped over it like a pretty, stained-glass window. At the Woolpack Inn in Gloucestershire, a pub that Laurie Lee used to love, we ate fresh beetroot with whole almonds and fiery horseradish. Brighton offered up the unmissable, tiny, but fabulous Palmito, and in nearby Lewes the compact but perfect Fork serves a fabulous Sunday lunch with rare beef that lives on in my heart, as do its starter of cauliflower velouté with blue cheese beignets and hazelnuts and the mont blanc with spiced sponge dessert. One evening at the end of summer, we went to Clay’s near Reading, a restaurant that rose from the ashes of lockdown, and ate crab minapa garelu (spiced doughnuts) and chepala pulusu (Andhra-style fish curry) with blush-coloured beetroot rotis off a menu that is a cacophony of family recipes: “Food,” I wrote, “doesn’t get any more personal than this.” Before I am banished from London completely for restaurant treason, there have been some wonderful openings in the capital this year: the recently relocated Chishuru, Akara and 64 Goodge Street are all places to put on your list, if you have one, while Tomos Parry’s Mountain is a buzzing, experimental rollercoaster of flavour, and as much evidence as you can have that London still wants to lead the way, even if Le Gavroche has called it a day. If you can nab a table at Homies on Donkeys in E11 for its heavenly Mexicana, go for the chicken thigh barbacoa tacos with smoked guajillo salsa and stay for the large plates of braised chuck pico de gallo and 90s hip-hop. But, alas, across London, this seemed to be the year that capacious luxury hotels offered star-name chefs and chic dining experiences at ridiculously fierce prices. As I stared forlornly at my £28 plate of drab green beans at House of Ming in the Taj Hotel, sitting at the table where they shove single diners, overlooking the loos and the place they scrape the plates, I felt somewhat shortchanged. In many London restaurants, portions have become hysterically small, with the term “prawns” often meaning “one prawn, sliced multiple ways”, pasta served by the tablespoon and £50 lobster dishes that turn out to be a taste of the tail on a lacklustre waffle. It costs a lot to keep the lights on, let alone buy ingredients, and in times such as these I find myself longing for the rugged cheerfulness of Casa Romana in Carlisle, with its plentiful plates of salmon cooked in sambuca, or the cosy, rural splendour of the Kirkstyle Inn at Slaggyford, Northumberland, where three courses of sheep’s cheese mousse, beef cheek and dark chocolate cremeux come in at £30, which in this day and age, I wrote at the time, “felt like a misprint”. So, London 0, the rest of the UK 1. But 2024 is all to play for …','https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/dec/29/grace-dent-favourite-restaurants-2023-review','Grace Dent','‘Where chefs let their freak flag fly’',-119.331939700000006,40.8594398500000011,-0.0258);

The store’s frontage is defiantly anonymous, and its signage understated, so perhaps you will also walk past two or three times while looking for it, as I did. In a postcode that’s full of shouty, shiny rooms to eat in, and to be seen eating in, most of them places that overpromise and under-deliver, King Cookdaily is befuddlingly low-key, especially considering its revered status among plant-based diners. The old joke goes that vegans are constantly announcing their presence, apropos of nothing, lest anyone miss their very saintliness. At King Cookdaily, however, it would take the unfamiliar guest a few long, hard looks at the menu to realise there’s not a scrap of meat or animal by-product on offer here. The vibe is Buddhist, but there’s devil in the detail. That High Grade bowl, for example, is a deft blend of fresh veg – carrot, cabbage, mushroom, yam, plus plenty of minced garlic and ground dried red pepper – stewed until soft and served in a thoughtfully engineered, smoky sweet-and-sour barbecue sauce. It is all then topped with a crumble of hemp. Life is too short to crumble your own hemp, even if it is a superfood, plus I wouldn’t know where to begin. You can have your High Grade over steamed coconut rice or load it with extra tofu or, if you like, chick’n. Yes, that sort of chick’n, where the apostrophe is literally the difference between life and death, because no clucky things are harmed in its making. The Yoga Fire, my go-to on this menu, is a delicately spiced yellow curry of soft chickpeas, sweet potatoes and mung bean dal, all simmered slowly in golden coconut milk, served over steamed rice and garnished with cucumber raita. It is a bowl of profound, restorative goodness. In fact, this is literally the only “fast food” that my body thanks me for. I love vegan dining, but recently so much of it has slipped towards the decadent, the “dirty” and the deep-fried. King Cookdaily, however, errs on the fresh, the crunchy, the al dente and the fibrous, and serves vegetables in an instantly recognisable form. Chef King Cook himself has been perfecting his plant-based offering since 2009, when he attracted all sorts to his previous shop in the nearby Box Park; they included armfuls of hip-hop artists, US film stars and British young bright things – in other words, the sort of people who look as if they get their five a day. When he opened this new venture, then, you’d have been forgiven for thinking that this was the point when the bells, whistles and hoopla would finally begin, with a multi-floor dining space, living greenery walls, Insta-friendly staging and maybe a merch shop at the entrance. But no, it’s the same low-key, let-the-food-sing-for-its-supper vibe as before. There are still no plates, just the same biodegradable bowls and cardboard forks. There are no fancy signature sodas, no premix cocktails; rather, there are five varieties of Thai Foco pop on offer – guava, pomegranate, sugar cane, mangosteen and soursop. I asked if they had a fancy, middle-class kombucha, like Guardian readers drink, but they shook their heads and offered me a Peak Calm “mood drink” with tryptophan to help soothe my furrowed brow. King Cookdaily doesn’t even have the obligatory open kitchen, where we could maybe catch sight of the man himself sweating over his increasingly famous vegan lao bowl, a meat-free take on the national dish of Laos that loses nothing by omitting blood and sinew. After all, perhaps we want to see where the unami-rich chick’n mince is cooked with green herbs and served over sticky plantain and toasted sticky rice. Perhaps, like Salt Bae with his salt, we’d like to see him flourishing his fresh radish. King Cookdaily will not be everyone’s cup of tea, but for many this is the sort of cooking that makes you question why you’re cluttering your innards with flesh. Perhaps the answer is just that a normal mortal can’t cook vegetables this well at home. Take another signature, the Hard Bowl, which features glorious, twice-cooked cassava: cooked by the wrong hands – in fact, cooked by my hands – it’s always a complete mess, but here it is soft, yielding and mixed with ackee, boiled dumplings, fresh thyme and a judicious amount of scotch bonnet chilli. This is futuristic vegan cooking, using old, beloved ideas. It’s food for people who, like Mark E Smith, want to Eat Y’self Fitter, but don’t quite know how to do that at home. I have no idea how to scramble tofu with black Indian salt, as King Cook does in his KCD pad Thai, or how to add it to flat noodles without creating a vast, gelatinous lump. But I’m quietly pleased that there’s a man in east London who resolutely, if rather quietly, does. King Cookdaily 10 Hanbury Street, London E1 (no phone).

Let me start with the decor: the plush, cherry-red carpets, the velvet chairs, the marble tabletops, the mahogany panelling and the beige leather banquettes. Basically, it gives off “chicest dining option on a swanky 1960s cruise ship, complete with a swarm of seagulls chasing you from Civitavecchia to Cartagena” vibes; it also zings with “restaurant adjacent to a Monte Carlo poker table where James Bond might woo Honey Ryder”, although 007 would have to bet on Honey loving chicken, because that’s the only main course Bébé Bob offers. One bird, served for two, with legs, thighs, wings and breasts on a plate with a kitsch red logo. Bébé Bob is essentially a rotisserie restaurant wearing a fur coat and Rigby &amp; Peller knickers. Selling just the one item and doing it well is very much du jour in restaurant-land these days, though: it cuts costs, faff and fuss, while at the same time emitting an air of culinary expertise. Bébé Bob, as you may have guessed from the name, is a pared-down spin-off from the nearby well-established Bob Bob Ricard, which is best known for its Instagram-friendly “press for champagne” buttons, chicken kiev and -18C shots of Staritsky Levitsky small-batch vodka. Bob Bob Ricard is completely ridiculous, so it is a huge relief that its little sister doesn’t let it down. Now, about those birds on which the menu so heavily relies: Bébé Bob serves either Vendée chicken from Pays de la Loire or Landaise chicken from Gascony, both the kind of plump, painstakingly reared bird that weary food experts advise us all to eat, rather than £6 supermarket chooks with gammy legs and cysts. Vendée chickens have no such woes – these are VIP chickens, VICs, if you will. Landaise chickens are such exclusive cluckers, meanwhile, that they didn’t even show up on the day we visited. “We only have Vendée today,” our waiter said, without even acknowledging that this meant the tiny menu had at a stroke been effectively halved. I couldn’t be cross about it, though. The place is too tongue-in-cheek silly to get mad at. “Inspired by the golden age”, this boss-level KFC says on its glitzy website. “Fashionwear is welcome, activewear is not … Guests under 15 years old are not admitted,” and the really quite brilliant: “Tables are available for up to four guests only. Larger groups, alas, cannot be accommodated.” The fabulous, pass-agg positioning of that “alas” makes me purr with joy. Offity-fuck you go, Kardashian clan, with your extended broods and your Balenciaga-Adidas spandex workout stilettos. No posh chicken for you! No truffled fries. No delicious sides of chicken fat-encrusted roast potatoes, honeyed parsnips and carrots, also drenched in chicken fat. All of them are outstanding, by the way, this being VIC fat. Charles griped that his own roast chicken is better, softer and seasoned more deftly, but I argued that he makes just the one at a time, not 100 of the things, so we could maybe cut them some slack. We’re still arguing about that. Bébé Bob may well be accused of having a lot of swagger for what is essentially a roast dinner restaurant round the back of Regent Street, yet, via smoke and mirrors, the whole thing hangs together rather well. The menu’s list of starters could easily be a paean to Margo from The Good Life entertaining Mrs Dooms-Patterson. There is prawn cocktail with VSOP cognac-infused marie rose sauce, eggs mayonnaise draped with Cantabrian anchovies, a dressed winter leaf salad and smoked salmon with buttered rye bread. None of these will bend the mind of a dedicated gourmand; they are just tasty, inoffensive versions of Franglais dining classics. There is caviar, too, if that’s your bag: Siberian, Oscietra or Amurski, with creme fraiche and blinis, plus, if you can’t choose, a £49 dégustation plate featuring all three. We ate one Saturday lunchtime in a sedate but still jolly room of families, couples and groups of friends who clearly didn’t mind keeping the guest limit to four. Who needs more than three friends at dinner, anyway? Any more than that, and it’s just noise, and all those dishes you foolishly agreed to share end up at the wrong end of the table. Perhaps Bébé Bob has a point: four is just the right amount. With the choices for starters and mains so brief, desserts are similarly lightly administered. Unless you’re in Fuerteventura, a shot of lemon-infused vodka is not, strictly speaking, pudding. Neither is a scoop of lemon sorbet doused in vodka, although the booze might numb the pain of it costing £9. Being a creature of habit, I went for the Paris-Brest, because there is no such thing as a bad one. Show me a collision of choux pastry, praline cream and blanched almonds that I’ll balk at? Impossible. It wasn’t the greatest Paris-Brest in London (that would be Cédric Grolet’s Paris-Brest flower over at the Berkeley, a snip at £35), but it was definitely decent. Bébé Bob is a chicken-and-chips joint that thinks it is “it”, and I shan’t tell them otherwise. Bébé Bob 37 Golden Square, London W1, 020-7242 1000.

Once upon a time, Borough Market was a weekend affair, but now it’s a genteel, organic sort of bedlam every single day. It’s the perfect place to open somewhere like Akara, the second restaurant from Aji Akokomi, who in 2020 opened Akoko, a fine-dining excursion around the owner’s west African heritage that, to my mind, is well worthy of a Michelin star. Akara is Akoko’s more casual younger sibling, a place where newbies to west African cuisine can dangle a toe, while more well-versed diners can come to judge the chef’s take on efik coconut rice in a smart, beautifully lit industrial-chic space. Actual akara are, of course, on the menu, too. They could, roughly speaking, be called fritters, though I’d compare them more to fried fairy cakes – spongey, golden, almost resembling financiers, although in truth these particular buns, which inspired the Brazilian street-food snack, the acarajé, are made from loved and much-laboured-over black-eye beans. The beans are soaked, shelled, whisked, pulverised and transformed into a light batter before being deep-fried until golden. In the wrong hands (namely, my clumsy shovels), akara would be a disaster, but here they are plump, voluptuous and stuffed with the likes of sweet, spiced barbecued tiger prawns, soft, yielding braised ox cheek, barbecued wild mushrooms or a seared hand-dived Orkney scallop. Each akara comes in its own little box, so don’t order them to share, as we did. They are best tackled with both hands and accompanied by the house scotch-bonnet soda, a non-alcoholic beverage offering all the elegance of a cool, clear, long soda with a heat rating of about 200,000 units on the Scoville scale. We visited on a midweek lunchtime, when the place was pleasingly busy, possibly because so many of London’s smart restaurants don’t seem to open until Wednesday evenings at the moment. As a result, Akara was packed with solo food obsessives photographing their lunches and smart business groups enjoying the plantain old fashioneds, the cacao and date negronis and the short wine list. The food is hearty rather than fancy; if, for example, you order the Lagos chicken from the larger plates section of the menu, what turns up is a whole, splayed, spatchcocked poussin drizzled with vibrant orange sosu kaani, a Senegalese hot sauce singing with habanero chilli peppers and garlic. There’s also grilled pollock with a yassa sauce made from deeply caramelised onion and lemon, and a vegan dish of grilled cabbage in carrot sauce and herby oil. This isn’t stand-on-ceremony food, this is a dig-in type of dinner – although your servers will happily explain the cooking process if you ask them to. The standout dish for me was a side of fried plantain with octopus, served in a curiously delicate and deft way, and made lively with pepper relish. The efik rice is pale, having been simmered in chicken broth and coconut, and, if you like, comes topped with seared mackerel. If you want something green on the table to make you feel healthy, there is a salad of baby gem, crisp shallots and spiced peanuts to pair with your Senegalese-sauced poussin. This is a confident restaurant taking its first tottering steps, offering modern, playful, imaginative riffs on food that clearly means so much to Akokomi. It is no small feat to trailblaze in this way, bringing much-loved dishes to an audience that may never have eaten them before, and hoping both to delight and to broaden horizons. Akoko, for me, was groundbreaking, and the more casual, everyday Akara is a spiriting slice of joy for London’s dining scene. We finished with tamarind date sponge cake with tonka bean cream, which was kind of inevitable from the moment I saw it on the menu, because I am rather fixated by the richness of the tonka bean and the slightly macabre aspect that, in the wrong hands, it can be poisonous; in fact, it has been banned in the US since 1954 due to, ahem, casualties. I trusted Akara not to kill me, though. Let’s face it, the paperwork would be arduous. Less brave sorts can go for the coconut and lime sorbet, which is a citric blast to send you on your way feeling fully awakened. Akara is worth visiting if only for the dish the place is named after. Be honest, you’re never going to shell those black-eye beans yourself. Akara Arch 208, 18 Stoney Street, London SE1, 020-3861 5190. Open Tues-Sat, lunch noon-4pm, dinner 6-11pm.

I adore the word “foodie”, because it makes foodies themselves shudder, but how else to describe an area so knee-deep in artisan viennoiserie, so sodden with sourdough pizza, and where you’re never more than 20m from an earnest soul pickling grusas capers? Eating out is already a tactical game round these parts, and anywhere that gets hyped is instantly oversubscribed. Calling up Max Rocha’s nearby Cafe Cecilia to enquire about the possibility of a last-minute table, for example, feels a bit like phoning the Tower of London to ask if you can pop by and try on the crowns. Risible. And now here’s Sune, which opens just a few evenings a week, by Honey Spencer and Charlie Sims, who have been called a “hospitality power couple”, which sounds terribly intimidating, though in all fairness they are absolutely not. In fact, they’re delightful, which is one reason, on the wettest of Wednesday evenings and only a few weeks in, the place was mobbed. Spencer and Sims, as well their chef Michael Robins, come with a pedigree from all kinds of “foodie” icons. Noma is in there, of course, because all restaurants these days must have at least one staff member who has herded ants for René Redzepi; Lyle’s is in there, too, as are the Palomar, the Barbary, the Midland Grand Dining Room and Akoko, all places I’d take a punt on for dinner any day. Spencer is a renowned sommelier – the restaurant is named after her mentor, Sune Rosforth – so expect natural wines, about a dozen types by the glass, while if you’re like me and have stopped boozing, she will tempt you over to the weird and wonderful world of experimental, low-intervention, funky, kombucha-style brews – cloudy, whiffy things that taste like distilled elderflower marsh fog with a slight hint of feet and voles’ tears, which I don’t mean in any pejorative sense. The future of non-drinking is weird, and I like it. If Sune hasn’t annoyed you enough yet, let me explain the menu. It is a single sheet of about 10 ever-changing dishes, one of which, on the night we visited, was ready-salted crisps with egg yolk and eel. And by that I mean good, properly salty homemade crisps with decent chunks of silver-skinned fish. Sune is one of those restaurants, a bit like Primeur or Westerns Laundry, where the menu features intriguing, delicious phrases such as “Galician sea urchin and tomato” and “fermented dairy beef tartare and croque monsieur” alongside those eely crisps, grilled pork chop with prawn sauce and a plate of potatoes. Whether you consider such a hotchpotch of sharing plates – a turbo cheese sandwich, pasta and potatoes, say – “a proper dinner” is up to you. For me, these restaurants are more a rumination on fine produce, memories, influences, restaurants worked in and countries travelled to. We shared a homemade flatbread so hot from the oven that we needed to wait to tackle it and scoop it through a bowl of pleasingly brutal whipped horseradish topped generously with vivid orange salmon roe. Excellent. Then came that croque monsieur, which for any British comprehensive schoolchild of the 1980s was the only dining option in France. Sune’s version is a crisp, cheesy, sticky and stinky toastie with a roof rack of roughly diced, deftly seasoned raw beef. Again, wonderful. I do not normally care much for croque monsieur or for beef tartare, but here I was sharply elbowing friends who were silly enough to think it was for sharing. A bowl of strozzapreti pasta with corra linn cheese, by contrast, while satisfying, was hardly a showstopper. Choices for dessert are brief – on the night we went, there was pear tart with sorbet or sorbet with meringue, as well as shropshire blue with caraway crackers – and the list skips quickly over actual puddings and on to a range of boozy, after-dinner treats: Talisker 10-year-old, Laphroaig quarter cask and 12-year-old Yamazaki at £30 a shot. The tart was lovely, if not earth-shattering, with thin, crisp pastry and a pear topped with an eau de vie caramel sorbet that was luxuriant and silky enough to pass for ice-cream. There is some amazing destination cooking going on at Sune, as well as a few completely forgettable dishes, but since the menu changes constantly, it feels very much like a restaurant to which you’d return if only out of curiosity. Sune is warmly staffed, determined and still finding its feet, menu-wise in the most public of ways. Right now, you’ll get a table here much easier than at Cafe Cecilia – but only just. Sune 129a Pritchard’s Road, London E2, 020-4568 6675. Open lunch Fri &amp; Sat, noon-2.30pm, dinner Weds-Sat, 5.30-10.30pm.

A bit of Whitney gives way to Michael Jackson, via a segue into The Girl from Ipanema. Tall and tan and young and lovely she may well be, but I can’t lie. Her passing by is not making me go “Ah”, because it’s a little hard for me to focus on my delightful fried sea bass. The more senior quartet of diners to my right is in active, if very polite, suburban revolt. They have complained to the waiter that they can no longer hear themselves think, let alone what each other has to say. Never fear, for the waiters are attentive to their customers’ needs. The live music is turned down. Dissent dissipates. Contentment reigns anew. As a diehard south Londoner, I feel tonight like I am a very long way off my patch, here on the unpromising edge of the Great North Road, as it labours to escape north London. True, I am employed to travel great distances just to eat. I once flew to Inverness for lunch. On another occasion I took three trains west across Wales just for dinner. But this trip, to the very northern tip of the Northern line and then a 10-minute walk down a dark suburban trunk road, feels more intrepid than most. At the end of a journey which would be worthy of Odysseus if he owned an Oyster card, I reach a brightly lit, white-walled dining room, clad in intricate toffee-coloured Balinese textiles. The chairs are dressed in the same material right down to the wood-effect tiled floor as are the tables so that, once seated, it fills my field of vision. I fantasise for a moment about getting a suit made from a bolt of this gorgeous cloth. I could sit here and disappear from view, like a lion in the Serengeti. There are dangly lamps, a couple of faux living walls over by the loos and a little basket-wear, hung as decoration. All the serious action will be on the table in front of us. The Bali Satay House was recommended to me by a reader who saw it as a companion to Supawan Thai in King’s Cross, a family-run restaurant with a menu that dives deeper than most into unfamiliar parts of the Thai repertoire. It’s a point well made. Tonight’s menu contains familiar words, but the dishes they represent are less so. It starts with lacy, friable peanut crackers, still warm from the fryer, with the breathy aromatics of lemongrass. On the side is a fierce chilli-hot sambal, which invites my diaphragm to go into spasmodic hiccups. (Tell me: what’s your hiccup cure? Mine is to take a deep breath and then imagine there’s a balloon of air which I’m pressing down on into my chest. I think it’s the focus that halts the spasms rather than anything else, but it works for me. In my highly risky line of work, I find this a useful strategy.) As befits the name of the restaurant, the satay list is lengthy. Each of them arrives in a pottery platter placed in turn on an ornate brown ceramic burner so that many of the dishes become not just dinner, but also centrepiece. The mackerel satay appear as spiced fishcakes, formed on sticks and then fried. They come with coarsely chopped fresh onion and bird’s eye chillies with crispy onion. It’s a fun dish to chat over. The chicken satay, however, is the best kind of brown food, the sort of dish you keep glancing at, as if it’s waving at you. The smoky grilled chunks of thigh come under a blanket of sauce-cum-coarsely chopped peanut stew. It is the colour of varnished antique oak. It is both sweet and salty, and rich with spiced caramel tones. The chicken is great. It deserves all the good words like “tender” and “charred”. But it is only a supporting actor to the star of this show, the intense satay. I want to take a bucket of this stuff home with me and introduce it to everything I happen to have lurking in my fridge right now. For all its interest in chicken, lamb and beef, the menu is strong on plant-based options. We have deep-fried sweetcorn fritters, which remind me of similar dishes in the repertoire of Myanmar, the heat-blistered kernels bursting out of their skins amid the batter matrix. They are scattered with chopped spring onions and served with more of the perky sambal, which is weirdly addictive now the hiccups have subsided. Among the vegan mains, alongside tofu and seitan dishes, is a hefty salad of cucumber, chopped green beans, basil and green aubergine bound by a thick peanut and coconut milk dressing. It arrives surrounded by crackers and is very much salad as main event. It’s a good foil to the galangal-rich beef rendang, in its thick, glossy gravy. If you are one of those who prize a rendang for the crisped, friable edges and corners cooked out at the bottom of a hot pan, among whose number I count myself, be aware: you won’t find that here. It is a softer, soupier version, but with huge depths. The chopped fresh red chilli is there to provide any fire you might crave. Finally, alongside a dome of sesame seed-flecked jasmine rice, is the flash-fried fillet of sea bass in a sweet-sour sauce. The skin is crisp. The flesh is bronzed around the edges. Egged on by the staff in their Balinese shirts, we are having a very nice time. For dessert we are pointed towards banana fritters with honey, which are a little batter-heavy and solid. The pleasingly grainy coconut ice-cream, made here, helps send them on their way. Far better are fried, sesame-crusted dumplings made with sweet potato and filled with an ooze of brown sugar caramel. To go with this there’s Indonesian beer, Swedish cider and an offer on spirits that is clearly aimed at those who don’t have to get up in the morning. The second set has now begun and the duo are exploring the 80s back catalogue with uncompromising vigour. On principle and out of solidarity with musicians, I can never object to live music anywhere, but for those who are less keen the website says it happens every Thursday. On Wednesdays, it’s Balinese dancing. That also sounds like fun. In truth, though, just as with the decor, the real entertainment is always going to be provided by the food. News bites Members of the Jewish community in Margate have come together with hospitality and other businesses in the town who were planning a fundraising drive to aid humanitarian work in Gaza, and instead together have launched a crowdfunder raising money for groups pursuing peace and humanitarian initiatives on both sides of the Israel-Gaza divide. It’s focused on a Feast for Peace, next Wednesday, 31 January, at the Curve Coffee Store in Margate, featuring dishes from across the region, but there is also a range of raffle prizes. To buy tickets for the dinner and raffle prizes, or simply to donate go here. The Ottolenghi restaurant group is planning its first opening outside London, with a new restaurant and deli planned for a former Pain Quotidien site in Bicester Village, Oxfordshire. The business, fronted by chef and writer Yotam Ottolenghi, has just opened its sixth deli in Hampstead, London. Ottolenghi has also said he is eyeing international expansion with an outpost planned for Paris (ottolenghi.co.uk). Gary Townsend, the former head chef of One Devonshire Gardens in Glasgow, is to open his own restaurant in the city, with a £400,000 investment. The 40-cover Elements will be on New Kirk Road in the suburb of Bearsden and will serve a four-course menu at lunch and both a tasting menu and à la carte in the evenings, using ingredients from across Scotland (elementsgla.com). • This article was amended on 28 January 2024 because an earlier picture caption misnamed the dish onde onde as ubi goreng.

Let me say it again: Eggslut. For people who are sluts about eggs. In a world where “you can’t say anything any more”, apparently, Eggslut has spread its legs: New York, Los Angeles, Seoul, Tokyo and now five sites in London, including a large new eggy pleasure palace in Stratford, where they play She’s Lost Control by Joy Division into a stark, industrial, cement-chic setting and the scrambled egg and salmon roll costs £15. Eggslut, which since 2010 has grown from a humble food truck into a global, albumen-focused fast food conglomerate, does not care what you think about its name, though. It doesn’t care if the name gives you the ick, pushes you into a feminist rage or sounds a lot like non-edgy people trying to be edgy. Over the past decade, I have waited for a company stooge to plead for forgiveness and for the place to rebrand as Eggqueen, but no – and, to be honest, it is this type of unapologetic doubling down in restaurant land that I live for. Without such chutzpah, I’d never get to enjoy Clap, which opened recently in Knightsbridge offering “sensory Japanese dining”, rather than a large dose of antibiotics to bring down the swelling. Or, for that matter, the billion-pound luxury hotel refit OWO, which opened in Whitehall late last year, defiantly ignoring what “OWO” means to any Londoner who has seen those adverts that used to be left in public phone boxes. While Eggslut doesn’t care about semantics, it does have an interest in the death of the British greasy spoon, which is slowly being strangled by rates and rents. Brands such as Eggslut know that people still need casual breakfast dining options – hash browns, sausage muffins, coddled eggs in little pots with soldiers – and that the likes of the Breakfast Club have long queues every weekend. It also knows that Gen Z doesn’t quite believe that eschewing fancy, £9.95 scrambled eggs, which Eggslut serves on a glossy roll with cheese, sriracha mayo, chives and caramelised onions, will help them to save up for a £300k starter flat, so they’ve decided to enjoy the eggs anyway. Eggslut’s menu is brief; it is comfort food made ostensibly of good produce, and almost everything comes in a brioche bun. There are eggs with applewood smoked bacon, cheddar and chipotle ketchup, eggs with portobello mushroom paté and hollandaise, chopped hard-boiled eggs with honey mustard aïoli and dressed rocket. Other options are the Gaucho, which features seared wagyu tri-tip steak with an egg over easy and chimichurri sauce, or a chicken-and-egg sando (presumably for people who find saying the word “sandwich” arduous), or one with crisp pork belly and romesco. Whatever you order, however, you’re facing a meal on a tray, with no cutlery, and in a room that’s only slightly more comfortable than a building site. The paper napkins will be your closest friend, too, because another problem with almost everything at Eggslut is the sheer drippy, oozy messiness of it all, with yolk down your face and a brioche bun that cannot stand the weight of its innards. This bun is cheap. It is not fit for purpose. Don’t eat here if you wish to retain any decorum, or to dine while wearing anything prettier than a sou’wester. Modern, yes. Decadent, absolutely. But a pleasurable experience? Not really. Having tried Eggslut several times now, and after weathering several collapsing £15 sandwiches, their OK if forgettable hash browns and a dessert list that offers an odd-looking chocolate chip cookie covered in grey salt and served in a bag, I can’t help thinking that, for the price, it should all just be a bit better (the plastic display containers on the counters showing the dessert choices should definitely all look a little less wilted). Eggslut is the plain, minimalist reaction to the bright, multicoloured, kid-friendly McDonald’s or Burger King, with their glowing, above-counter menus and enforced jolliness. Eggslut is a sea of cement where no chair is the best chair, and where they take £45 out of your account for two of you to eat an unmemorable fried-egg butty with a slice of salmon, a filter coffee and perhaps a doughnut each, before heading back out into the February winds with egg yolk down your sleeve and a creeping feeling that the local greasy spoon, where set menu A, with double bubble and a cup of teafor about £6.99, used to be so nice. I have tasted the new face of the all-day breakfast and, while it’s intriguing, eggs is eggs, and there’s nothing revolutionary happening here. The prices, though, are a – cough – yolk.

Margate’s demographic and its food scene may have shifted a fair bit over the past decade, but this Kentish seaside town will never be like gorgeous but airy-fairy Aldeburgh or Southwold. Yes, modern Margate is far prettier than it used to be, but it will never be prettified to that hyper-real state that happens when seaside towns go posh and end up finding themselves swimming in £7 sausage rolls, with the locals all sold up and the newcomers working on watercolour exhibitions. Modern Margate is certainly a bit “let’s go to see the new Tracey Emin, then pop by Angela’s for a small plate of turbot head brawn with pickles”, but it’s also still very much Chas Hodges rhyming “buckets and spades and cossies and all” with “fill of jellied eels at the cockle stall”, and if you come here to “summer” in 2024, there will still be a brutalist 1960s tower block overlooking the beach. The restaurant Sète is a short walk from the town centre in Cliftonville and began life just over a year ago as a “Parisian-inspired wine bar”, a mood that owner and manager Natalia Ribbe has well and truly nailed. As you approach the door, you see a dewily candlelit, informal room filled with customers perched on stools and supping their choices from the handwritten specials blackboard. Nothing fancy or remotely intimidating, but still elegant, which those Frenchies are so very good at. Ribbe, who is not French but German/American, could have stopped there, because she’d taken a former sweet shop and turned it into a marvellous place to drink pet nat “à la orange” with perhaps a plate of anchovies on toast. Job done. However, she then went on to open a 40-seater restaurant in the back room with food by Billy Stock, formerly of St John and the Marksman in London. Stock’s menu is French-leaning, too, with pungent, sweet confit garlic and goat’s curd stuffed into vol-au-vents, braised squid on olive toast with puddles of vibrant aïoli and slices of thick, creamy, lardon-bejewelled tartiflette. Everything is served as small sharing plates, but still very much hangs together well as a meal. The best thing on the menu – or, indeed, perhaps on any menu I’ll eat this year, and it’s only February – is Stock’s chicken schnitzel, there in honour of Ribbe’s heritage. The tender schnitzel, robed in crunchy breadcrumbs, is served with a whopping quenelle of Café de Paris butter, though Stock’s version is like a steroid-riddled curry sauce mated with a buttercream ganache. Sète has few fancy bells and whistles; it is a warm, pleasing, straightforward room decorated in creams and browns, and reminds me of the 70s, when Britain still loved beige and tapioca. What the place does have, however, is the winning combination of Ribbe at the helm and Stock on the stoves. Ribbe is a natural, effusive host, flitting from back room to front room with ease, and bringing together all corners of the bar and restaurant. Stock, meanwhile, is plainly a very good cook who adds breathtaking depth to even the simplest dishes. Take his curried lamb mince with turnips. “Let’s order the lamb mince – that sounds delicious!” said no one ever, because in the wrong hands lamb mince is bad school canteen shepherd’s pie or, at its very worst, salty stodge, but here Stock makes it multilayered, sweet, herby, spicy and fragrant, and serves it with small, peeled, softened baby turnips. There’s also a deftly dressed, crunchy salad laden with king crab and, for me, the star of the show, pumpkin in tempura with a pesto-like pumpkin-seed dressing and a lot of grated parmesan. Yes, it turns out you can batter and deep-fry a pumpkin, and we are fools not to have done so until now. On the evening I visited, a choux bun filled with sweet vanilla custard and a layer of stewed forced rhubarbcalled to me from the short pudding list. Sète is small, unshowy and just a little away from Margate’s main drag, so it may well be overlooked by daytrippers. But if you’re in the know and down here to catch some art at TKE Studios or some waves once the days grow warmer, this is the place to reserve a table, check if the schnitzel is on and soak in the ambience of the costa del Kent. Sète 238 Northdown Road, Margate, Kent, 01843 606007. Open dinner only, Weds &amp; Thurs, 6-9pm, Fri 6-9.30pm, Sat 4-9.30pm.

Kokum is also the name of a modern Indian restaurant on East Dulwich Road in south-east London that, like all contemporary subcontinental restaurants, has a tightrope to walk: they’re brimming with ambition and a need for authenticity, while at the same time having to cater to a neighbourhood clientele. Kokum the restaurant offers uthappam rice pancakes, fish koliwada and beef short rib stewed nihari-style, and aims to explore different culinary corners of this vast country while also being aware of the need to list at least one chicken dish in a tomatoey sauce on the mains so as not to scare the horses. New openings such as this want their decor to be chic, semi-industrial and never cosy or chintzy, and to offer complex cocktails spiced with chai and cayenne, but know they run the risk that locals may come to visit once, deem the place “a bit trendy” and never return. The other dilemma is that this kind of authenticity doesn’t come cheap: that nihari short rib contains saffron and kewra, and the boozy Kalcutta cosmos feature roasted fenugreek syrup. “Eleven pounds fifty for a raan uthappam!?” some will shriek, overlooking that this stew of kid lamb is simmered for 12 hours and served with homemade coconut chutney. If anyone can pull this trick off, it is Sanjay Gour, who used to be head chef at Gymkhana in the West End of London, which was a gamechanger in the British-Indian restaurant world. I could wax lyrical about the cooking, service and Michelin stars (of which, as of last week, it now has two), but that would possibly mask the main message, which is that Gymkhana is simply one of Britain’s best reasons to leave the house. Should anyone ever offer you a table there, say yes without blinking, order the lasooni wild tiger prawns, the methi malai mutter paneer and the rasgulla tiramisu. After leaving Gymkhana, Gour and his Gymkhana colleague Nand Kishor opened the much-loved Dastaan in Ewell in 2016 (and a second branch in Leeds in 2022), and Black Salt over in East Sheen. Kokum is Gour’s newest baby, where he works alongside co-founder Simeron Lily Patel and executive head chef Manmeet Singh Bali, ex of the Turnberry hotel in Scotland. We visited on the wettest, windiest winter Wednesday night imaginable, fully expecting to be the only people there and instead finding an almost booked-out restaurant. Whatever Kokum’s doing, word of mouth has certainly spread. From the small plates section of the menu, we tried the uthappam, which to the untrained eye looks a bit like a pikelet, all pale and puckered with holes, but which is, in fact, a kind-of dosa made with fermented rice batter and, in this instance, topped with a rich, dark, meaty stew. There are deceptively spicy pani puri: spherical, deep-fried little vessels of chickpea and potato singing with tamarind, mint and coriander and littered with moong sprouts. There’s an ornate samosa chaat in which chopped vegetable samosa, chickpeas, herbs and yoghurt combine to create a crunchy, balm-like mouthful. From the tandoori section, which also features kasundi prawns and roast cauliflower, we had the seekh kebab – a kofta-like roll of minced lamb made aromatic with cardamom and cumin, and served with a pile of softened onion salad and a quenelle of tempered apple chutney. If those starters sound a little on the fancy side and perhaps overly arty, you’ll be pleased to learn that the mains selection is much more brown, beige, gravy-laden things-in-bowls. Nobody wants butter chicken, lamb rogan josh or pork vindaloo deconstructed and served with a sparkler. Still, Kokum’s main courses are made with the same seriousness as the small plates: prawns are made lively with lime leaf, coconut sauce and patty pan squash, and a paneer makhani with cottage cheese has just the right amount of fenugreek. There is a pride in this cooking, in each Hyderbadi biryani and even in each serving of pre-dinner papads and pickles, while attentive staff keep a close eye on the likes and dislikes of every table. Writing about bread can sometimes feel a waste of words, but Kokum’s truffle pecorino kulcha is outrageous. Did I really need a cheesy, truffly flatbread to wipe through a puddle of slow-cooked black lentil dal? No, it was probably louche and unnecessary. But would I do it again, then carry on and order the bebinca coconut and cardamom cake, leave clasping a variety of paper bags full of little leftover bits and eat the rest of the kulcha stood at the door of my fridge the next day? Yes, in an instant. Kokum is a neighbourhood restaurant that’s bringing Gymkhana-style newness and experimentation to a corner of south-east London, and at about half the price. By the looks of things, the locals have already found it, and they probably won’t thank me for telling you. Kokum 58-60 East Dulwich Road, London SE22, 020-3551 1883.

Mid-February brings a yearly glut of “restaurants for romance”: places with views, places with booths, places with plastic indoor floral displays and places serving a special Valentine’s set menu with asti spumante and a helium balloon. None of these things makes my heart beat, but I’ll tell you what does: acoustic absorption. This, to me, is the sexiest phrase in the modern restaurant landscape, so when someone told me that the Dover, a New York-style Italian restaurant on Mayfair’s Dover Street, was a place one could hear and be heard, it was duly noted. Having now been, I can attest this is true: velvet curtains, wood panelling and not one but two tablecloths on each cover make every table feel like its own private island, where diners can hear their friends and, crucially, be unheard by other tables. This is gold dust. Privacy is romantic. Oh, and so is good lighting. The Dover, a restaurant by former Soho House chief Martin Kuczmarski, has been said to be styled on Sophia Loren in the 1970s, which is another sexy phrase. Loren would look wonderful sitting in this gorgeously lit room, where each lightbulb is chosen to give your skin a radiant, just-stepped-off-a-film-set glow. The place isn’t candlelit, but it feels as if it is. It’s not often one feels sophisticated when ordering an Italian sausage pie or a hamburger, but this is one of those times. This new Mayfair hotspot – and it is hot right now – appeared in London just before Christmas, intriguing the food scene clique by being wholly, defiantly anti-intriguing. There was no glitzy launch, no invites to influencers, no photos of VIPs in underwear sipping vesper martinis. It was almost as if Kuczmarski – after 16 years with Soho House, at the forefront of exclusivity and manufactured FOMO – had grown tired of all the baloney. Anyone with deep pockets can hurl around free sliders and create a temporary buzz. Instead, the Dover serves spaghetti and meatballs, prawn cocktails, cheesecake and other dishes that are the opposite of experimental. The Dover did not seem to want to be found or spoken about; in fact, I challenge you to find its muted, dark, unsigned front door without walking the length and breadth of Dover Street at least twice, before eventually opening a black door and saying hopefully to someone behind the old-school handwritten reservations book: “Am I here?” Soon, you’ll be whisked into the bar, staffed by efficient, attractive Italians for a relaxing pre-dinner sleepy pony (Konik’s Tail vodka, limoncello, camomile and mint), before sipping it in the sort of elegant yet happening bar Goodfellas’ Henry Hill took Karen to when they were courting. All this about the Dover’s stylishness and vibe now said, the food is far better than I’d envisaged. This is basic comfort food served with aplomb: starters of prime beef steak tartare, nicely seasoned and pretty to look at, with a truffle and hazelnut salad, or prawns in marie rose sauce ornately arranged to resemble Mount Vesuvius. It’s your average prawn cocktail, but an aesthetically pleasing one. I did not try the Dover’s minestrone soup, mini hotdog or smoked salmon with blinis, or the chopped salad or the penne arrabbiata, but safe to say this menu isn’t a fancy-schmancy journey of introspection from a showy chef. It’s just dinner; a satisfying dinner – we ate well and left full. The branzino fillets on the mains menu were two plentiful, nicely cooked pieces of sea bass with a very good, chunky olive and aubergine caponata and a fine, pond-green, herby sauce. I ate that with a side of mash and jus – a small pot of the butteriest pomme puree swimming in gravy. The parmigiana americanata is a sloppy treat of aubergine, pasta, arrabbiata sauce and some dreamy parmesan fondue. This is a restaurant to keep up your sleeve for people who are sick and tired of restaurants – sick of the noise, sick of concrete walls, sick of sharing plates and of dishes arriving “as they’re cooked” – and for those who are tired of opaque menus and feel with general dismay that the golden age of dining is behind us. This is a place to dress up nice, open a door to 1970s upscale but naughty New York and eat a slice of baked cheesecake brulee safe in the knowledge that, due to top-class sound absorption, your darkest secrets are kept at your table. While 2024 may have only just begun, I don’t think that I’ll give you a better dining offer than that this year. The Dover 33 Dover Street, London W1, 020-3327 8883.

All dishes £5-£9.80. Unlicensed Once everything we’d ordered for lunch had arrived, a Chinese man on the next table leaned over and pointed approvingly at the array of steaming bowls: the wok-scorched ho fun, the brashly orange prawn sweet-and-sour, the golden lozenges of deep-fried pork chop with chilli salt and the rest. “I am impressed by what you have chosen,” he said. “It’s the food we would order.” He was part of a quartet of Reading residents, all originally from Hong Kong. I asked him if this was the food of home. He nodded vigorously and grinned. They all nodded vigorously and grinned. “Very much so,” he said. “And look at the amount you have ordered. I couldn’t eat all that.” I tamped down the shame and mumbled something about just trying to get a sense of the menu. But he was right. We had heroically over-ordered. Some of this would be coming back with us in takeaway boxes. That’s never a bad thing. Good Old Days Hong Kong Cuisine Ltd, to use its full name, was recommended to me by a friend who is blessed to live two minutes’ walk away in Caversham, or Reading’s Latin Quarter as no one has ever called it. Until last August the site, on a quiet residential street of bay-windowed terraces, was a takeaway called Burger Revolution. Slogan: Flavour is Freedom, which is a revolutionary rallying cry I could get behind. Then the Sung family moved in, operating first as a cash-only takeaway, before installing a mighty 14 seats in the spartan, white-tiled space. Two of those seats are side-by-side facing the wall, pulled in against a table of pure wood-effect Formica. There is nothing fancy about these good old days. Quickly word spread online among members of the town’s substantial Hong Kong community, which apparently has increased in size since 2021, when the government introduced the British National (Overseas) Visas for Hong Kong residents, following China’s security crackdown. The Sung family came here under the scheme to open this restaurant which, the online chatter said, seemed to be the real thing. Not that identifying what that means is straightforward to the untrained eye. It’s simple to spot the dishes of Sichuan or Hunan, courtesy of the relatively recent boom in restaurants from China’s diverse provinces, such as the Hunan Man, which I wrote about recently. Just look for heaps of brilliant red chillies; for steaming chilli oil-slicked broths, intriguing ways with offal, and liberal scatterings of tongue-buzzing Sichuan peppercorns. The menu of Cantonese classics here looks softer, more comforting and altogether more familiar. Before visiting, I showed it to the writer and cookery teacher Jeremy Pang, whose family is from Hong Kong. “At first glance it just looks like a standard English Chinese restaurant menu, doesn’t it?” he said. “There are black bean sauce dishes, and sweet-and-sour and so on.” It’s the stuff of a thousand suburban takeaways; of the arduous labour of an immigrant community working all hours to create opportunity for the next generation, one spring roll at a time. But item by item, Jeremy started to identify things that reminded him very much of trips back to see the family. It was interesting, he said, that there were two beef ho fun dishes. The lettuce with fermented bean curd was not something he’d seen on a British menu before. Over the water from Hong Kong in Macau, the deep-fried boneless pork chop on offer here would be sold in a bun. He’d always enjoyed eating those as a kid. And so to the backstory, told to us by Nicola Sung, who takes all the orders and delivers all the dishes. Her dad, Pui, is the chef. He had his own restaurant in Hong Kong for many years, before cooking at the Hong Kong Jockey Club, and then at the city’s gilded Four Seasons Hotel. It feels like finding a senior chef from the Ritz, now doing their own thing in your local caff, and doing it all rather splendidly. First, a quick note on what there is not. There are no spring rolls. There is no crispy duck with pancakes. Instead, there are pot sticker dumplings and a trio of shredded chicken dishes. We have the chef’s special shredded chicken, the marble-pale breast meat served cool. Underneath is a nest of noodle-sliced cucumber. On top is a vinegary sauce of finely chopped spring onions, coriander, garlic, ginger and chilli. It’s refreshing and awakening; the edible equivalent of splashing your face with a palmful of cold water in the morning. The bed for the rest of our dishes is a generous dome of egg-fried rice seasoned with salted fish, spring onions and pebbles of chicken. We lubricate it with the thickened, soy-rich liquor from the soft folds of beef with seasonal vegetables, and the sparklingly bright and glossy sauce coating the large sweet-and-sour prawns, which have been flash-fried so they still have a slight crunch on the outside and a squeak between the teeth. It’s a flashback to my childhood: a recollection of that moment in a local Chinese in northwest London when the food on my plate lurched into an astonishing wave of fruity colour for the first time. It’s good to be reminded of just how boisterously thrilling, how completely great, well-made sweet-and-sour can be. Then there are the flat, slippery ribbons of beef ho fun. They are an encouraging soy-brown with the appropriately smoky breath of wok singe to them. The most unfamiliar dish is the heap of wilted lettuce with the funk of that fermented bean curd, like a salty cheese that’s just about to turn, that’s followed up by a strident burst of chilli. The broth is restorative. The emerald-green leaves are a display of show just how satisfying cooked lettuce can be; how its balanced sweetness comes to the fore. Good Old Days is a modest place and so are the prices which, with a nod to lucky numbers, generally end in a three or an eight. The vegetable dishes start at £6.30. Only the seafood offering reaches the dizzying height of £9.80. If you want to splash out more, get a £15 jar of their absolutely banging homemade dried shrimp, pork and chilli-boosted XO sauce. Bring your own booze. Or if, like my friend, you happen to live nearby, get the food to go. Because in truth, Good Old Days is a takeaway that just happens to have a few tables. And it’s a damn fine one at that. News bites Chris Hicks and Alex Bagner, the couple behind The Rose in Deal, which I much enjoyed in the Autumn of 2022, are launching a Japanese-inspired restaurant and bar in the town towards the end of this month. The Blue Pelican will occupy a townhouse on Deal’s seafront, and will have a 10-seat kitchen counter, plus seating in a downstairs wine cellar. The chef is Luke Green, who ran the kitchen at the Rose under executive chef Nuno Mendes and who previously lived in Tokyo for five years. The menu includes skewers of pork collar with preserved greengages, homemade sesame tofu with daikon tops and crème caramel with kumquat and kinako. Thebluepelican.co.uk Interesting rumblings in the restaurant food delivery market with the announcement that the Mexican-inspired fast food chain Tortilla, which has more than 70 branches nationwide, has broken off its relationship with Deliveroo, citing commission charges which had ‘challenged margin performance’. In other words, working with Deliveroo was costing them too much. Instead, they will only be working through Uber Eats and Just Eat. Last October, KFC also severed links with the company. Deliveroo responded that it was ‘proud to partner with roughly 60,000 restaurants in the UK and Ireland’, thousands of which are Mexican. The team behind the much-admired Maison Francois, in London’s St James’s, is to open a more casual sibling in Borough Market. Café Francois, which opens in the autumn, will have an all-day menu of bistro classics including Toulouse sausages with lentils, rotisserie chickens, and steak sandwiches.

That is the first shot fired, warning you that the River Cafe this is not. Down an alley off Mare Street, and tucked into the side of an office block, Whyte’s is little more than some roaring hobs, a few tables and a bit of strategically daubed graffiti. I’ve sat in plusher minicab office waiting rooms. Not one tablecloth was troubled in creating the Whyte’s vibe, nor one napkin folded, origami-style, into a replica orchid. Instead, a dramatic plate of tempura octopus tentacle was delivered to the bar where we were perched watching chef Whyte Rushen at work. The tentacle was in a puddle of chip shop-style curry sauce. “Here you go,” said the server. “We call this the battered sausage of the sea.” That came shortly after a round of pickled onion Monster Munch-topped oyster and snail rockefeller and before a whopping great platter of tandoori john dory, a whole fish with a name like a Britpop B-side, served on the bone, skin rubbed with spice mix, all fragrant, crisp and with perfect flakes; it came with hot bowls of good homemade chips. Rushen’s restaurant, eating spot, dining hangout or whatever the hell he’s calling it is a judicious mix of chaos, misrule and careful, focused dining. This is his first solo bricks-and-mortar venture, having formerly worked at Brat, Scully and Kerridge’s, followed by several much-lauded, sell-out supper clubs. At those pop-ups, he made a name for himself by serving delicious things with off-the-wall names such as Stamford Hill Estate wagyu meatballs with burger sauce, brioche and duck-fat fries, and a dessert called “Off Licence” in which flambeed Basque cheesecake met poached fruit and Crunchie bars. Rushen’s food errs towards comfort-food classics – burgers, spag bol, fish and chips – but quickly pivots into postmodernism. Familiar recipes are broken down, reimagined and paired with popular 20th-century food icons. Why is there a slice of grilled Dairylea on top of my black cherry gateau? Why is this delicious cheese plate served with Hobnobs? Does the steak tartare really need the addition of Rice Krispies? Dishes are served with oceans of sauce and moppable jus; vanilla-braised endive comes in a blue cheese dressing, while salt and pepper frog’s legs turn up in a multilayered parsley sauce in various shades of green. Everything needs a spoon to scoop it up with, or at least some brioche or baguette to smear through puddles of mayo or gherkin ketchup. In the wrong hands, Whyte’s could be quite wearisomely wacky, but it isn’t; it is completely charming. This is an extremely talented chef clearly having some “mad scientist” time, not least because there’s no one to tell him not to. And, yes, obviously those Monster Munch-encrusted oysters will not be to everyone’s taste, particularly not to bivalve snobs, who consider even a little shallot vinaigrette a bit déclassé. Personally, though, I’m all for Rushen’s vision. Oysters, for instance, are often an anticlimax. I love the ceremony of ordering them, and hearing those dramatic, Shipping Forecast names such as Maldon rock, Carlingford, West Mersea, Porlock Pacific … I love the platter arriving, too, all the oohs and ahhs, the teensy forks, the lemon wedges, the dramatic swallowing. But all that buildup and fuss for two seconds of slightly bland, chewy snot? Whyte Rushen is right: coat those blighters in a maze of crunched-up pickled onion snacks, because oysters need all the help they can get. The menu at Whyte’s changes frequently, and as I write this he is going through a French period, offering confit trout with brown shrimp butter and braised rabbit with chocolate sauce and buttered cabbage. That last dish might sound a bit odd, but I can’t help but trust Rushen implicitly. Most evenings, there’s an enormous hunk of some fresh, whiffy, top-quality cheese such as bleu des Causses or bouyguette, submerged in honey and perhaps served with a few plump blueberries and maybe some toasted baguette. All this can and will change quickly. The best way to enjoy the place is to take a friend, arrive hungry and not remotely “on a diet”, wear something spongeable, sit up at the counter, and prepare to eat, laugh and at times be slightly startled. I’m not sure what Michelin would make of it all, but Whyte’s is already in my little black book under “weird but still pretty wonderful”. Whyte’s Unit 3, 143 Mare Street, London E8 (no phone).

Small plates £4-£12, cured meats £12-£22, large plates £13-£25, desserts £7, wines from £27 Hanging on the wall in the deep-varnished, oak-panelled stairwell at the Suffield Arms is a red neon sign which reads “Beer Girls Porn” with a blue neon arrow pointing to the ground floor. It is not entirely inaccurate. For all the restaurant trappings, this place still displays elements of pub. There is a public bar at the front with a pool table, a big screen TV and a number of ales on tap, many of them from local breweries like Lacons and Woodforde’s. Both genders are represented among the clientele, so in the very loosest sense of the sign, I suppose – and in a less than obliging manner – that’s the second word dealt with. Then there is the third word. Certainly, the walls are hung with pictures, of a sort which might once have been called “risqué”: faux American pin-ups; glowering documentary shots of life-class models, preparing to pose. That sort of thing. I gave these various images a bit of my male gaze and I’ll be honest: none of them started my engine (insert your alternative euphemism of choice here). And if it doesn’t do that, it’s art not porn. Perhaps all of this comes with the territory, by which I mean the fields that surround it. The Suffield Arms, located half an hour outside Norwich and a one-minute stroll from Gunton station, is a country pub, much as I am a country squire. Which is to say, I’ve been to the country and enjoyed myself there, but my heart is somewhere else, back in the belch and hard kerb of the city. Likewise, this is an outpost of urban sensibility amid the pasture and meadow. It’s the second business from the art dealer Ivor Braka, who has the Gunton Arms a couple of miles away. There, the walls are crusted with neon signs by Tracey Emin, flashing legends like “I said don’t practise on me”. There are works by Damien Hirst, Julian Opie and Paula Rego, and in the grounds, part of a sprawling deer park, sculptures by Anthony Caro and Sol LeWitt. It’s all displayed with the lightest of touches, as it is here. For these are places of studied, and extremely comfortable loucheness. At the Suffield Arms there are long, reconditioned communal tables which are less distressed than mildly disconcerted. There are slate-tiled floors. There’s a long counter edging the open kitchen, its frontage panelled in limed wood. Above the kitchen on the ceiling are daubed the names of painters from the Norwich School. Upstairs is what they call the saloon bar, a downlit snug with banquettes upholstered in blood-red corduroy, and swags of damask curtain, placing it somewhere between steampunk fantasy and Victorian brothel. In the most tasteful way possible, the whole place is mannered and contrived. All of which makes it a delightful place in which to loiter, even if you end up hating yourself just a little bit for liking it so very much. At the Gunton Arms the menu is, like your critic, meaty, butch and dark. There is a live fire grill and an Elk Room in which to eat. Here, the Spanish-accented menu, overseen by a young northern Italian chef called Alberto Mesini, is full of sunshine, soft winds and tidy ideas. To go with tumblers of sherry or vermouth there’s a lengthy list of jamón, lomo and chorizo, along with boquerones, tortillas, olives and almonds. So just your basic early evening in Granada, even on a grey winter’s day in Norfolk. There is also a mildly evolved selection of tapas. The mini chorizo sausages, which elsewhere might just lie languidly in a hot bath of cider, here come glazed with a sticky sauce of reduced rioja and honey. There are padrón peppers, and white Andalusian prawns, given the lightest of grillings, then allowed to swim through a lake of garlicky, parsley-rich butter. But the cooking also roams around Middle Eastern and North African flavours. Hunks of long-roasted lamb, in a sauce spiked with harissa, come with whorls of whipped hummus and puffy triangles of warm flatbread. The latter also turn up with a sweet-savoury dish of borani, the Iranian dip of puréed beetroot whipped up with yoghurt, garlic and walnuts, then heavily layered with crumbled feta. Aubergines have been cooked until mashable, then turned into lengthy, squared-off, crisp-shelled fritters with an almost liquid centre. Or chips as we might prefer to call them. They are stacked up like Jenga blocks and sprinkled generously with pomegranate seeds and more crumbled feta. A lot has been done to those aubergines for £7. I don’t need to tell you that these dishes are meant for sharing. For those who hate their friends and double dipping, there are also a few larger plates, priced from £15 to £25. A couple of these source their star ingredient from the deer park surrounding the Gunton Arms, where you can first admire the wildlife and then later eat it. There’s a venison tagine with apricots or a heaped pyramid of hand-cut tagliatelle, generously swamped with a venison and pancetta ragù cooked down until dark and almost crumbly. This is solid and satisfying cooking, rather than the stuff of thrills and grasps. It’s there to lubricate the chat and give purpose to a few lost hours at one of those long tables. The most on-brand dessert is a terracotta bowl of a furiously hot rice pudding, or arroz con leche, with bursts of citrus, under a bendy, melted sugar topping which will get stuck cheerfully in your teeth. Or, because they’re still cos-playing as an English country pub, there’s a rather good individual sticky toffee pudding in a deep lake of caramel sauce the colour of molasses. It’s while I am spooning away my sticky toffee pudding, purely in the name of diligent research, that I conclude I have really been far too literal with that neon sign in the stairwell. One of the things restaurants can do well is create a space in which you can participate in a kind of benign role play or fantasy. For a couple of hours, you are hanging out in a Thai beach shack or a Parisian café or in a Manhattan grill room where everyone talks in italics and the barman mixes a killer ice-cold martini. It’s all about trying on a lifestyle. The word “porn” in that sign? It was referring to the whole of the delicious Suffield Arms experience. And I am very much here for it.

But in this current restaurant landscape, where so many play it safe with the decor, The Blue Pelican in Deal, Kent, is definitely not a subscriber. It’s more like walking into Hokusai’s Great Wave off Kanagawa, a cacophony of tasteful blues, chilli pepper-coloured chessboard floor, striped cushions and, on one wall, a large mural of that very same wave, though this one is not by Hokusai but by local artist Tom Maryniak and it laps against the Deal seafront. Rarely do I mention a restaurant loo so early in proceedings, but at the Blue Pelican they’ve painted the tiny, under-the-stairs space such a vivid, fiery terracotta and lit it so gorgeously that it’s very possibly the prettiest place to spend a penny in 2024. You may not be surprised to learn that one of the founders, Alex Bagner, once worked for Wallpaper* magazine, or that, alongside her husband, Chris Hicks, they also run Deal’s Rose hotel and restaurant, which is equally aesthetically pleasing. Their new venture, meanwhile, is a Japanese-inspired, seafront townhouse restaurant and boutique yoga studio. Those two operations, I’m happy to say, do not overlap: not a single woman in a LuluLemon leotard went into a downward dog over the course of my Friday lunch. Instead, there was a busy room of locals, many of them just popping in for cocktails at the sit-up bar. And, despite it being the dankest, brolly-blowing winter’s day, the place was full of diners enjoying sesame tofu with daikon and three-cornered leek, and a rather boozy, sake-laced broth with chicken tsukune meatballs and hedgehog mushrooms. This is one of the most intriguing and punchy menus you’ll come across on the entire south coast, with chef Luke Green clearly excited and influenced by the Tokyo dining scene. Expect a skewer of pork collar with preserved greengages, clay-baked rice donabe with braised short-rib or, for vegetarians, roast chestnuts and rainbow chard, and halibut with clams, monksbeard and white miso. There are sides of pickles and ferments, bowls of cucumber and seaweed salad, and one quite unforgettable offering of utterly heavenly roast pink fir potatoes with walnut miso and cavolo nero. Nothing on Green’s menu is bland or pedestrian, and his cooking is one hefty poke after another of sake, mirin, soy, cumin, bergamot and whiffy, aged things. Even a plate of delica pumpkin, wreathed delicately in tempura, came stacked high, drizzled with fermented honey and dusted with a dark-green seaweed powder. It was excellent, and absolutely worth undoing every calorie ever burned off adopting a warrior or sun salutation pose. A slice of painstakingly rolled, sansho pepper-enhanced tamagoyaki, or Japanese omelette, came topped with smoked eel, while jerusalem artichokes and kale tops turned up in a glorious barley miso. Service is utterly unpretentious – rather, they’re friendly, knowledgable and quite clearly aware that the chef here is a real talent. The Blue Pelican could easily just have served pricey fish and chips for tourists to eat in a seaside setting, but instead they’ve gone out on a limb and set up a very classy, experimental, neighbourhood Japanese restaurant that I expect the locals will not feel like sharing with down-from-Londons clutching their yoga mats and eating all the halibut with calçots. For me, that halibut and calçot dish was the absolute highlight, a hulking great meaty lump of fish on the bone, perfectly timed, lying on a pile of sweet, caramelised onions and made pretty and even more fishy by vivid red trout roe. The pudding list, however, is not a list – it’s just the one offering, and on the day we went that was a kinako-flavoured creme caramel with kumquat. Take it or leave it. We left it. Fill up instead on those glorious walnut-miso potatoes. We ordered one portion to share and, due to my predictable behaviour around any sort of fancy spud, the atmosphere on the train home was rather frosty. Deal has got itself a little smasher of a place to eat dinner. Come for the food and, if you’re anything like me, steal all their ideas for paint and wallpaper.

Here, I’m using the term “foodie” to denote anyone who gets terrifically jolly at the mere thought of heirloom carrots, Swedish coastal honey and robatayaki skewered whelks for brunch. Not to mention the 500 people making social media content by throwing a peace sign next to the chocolate-coated strawberry stall and the other 10,000 or so, influenced by that content, now meeting seven friends outside Padella at noon on a Saturday. If you think that sounds like utterly unenjoyable chaos, you could very well be right. My advice for visiting Camille, which is on the periphery of this bunfight, is to plan your route in advance, write the address on your arm in case the 5G drops out the moment you leave London Bridge station, and walk swiftly and purposefully to Camille and order a stiff drink immediately. Also, rest assured that, once you’re safely through the door, the place is a little slice of calm with not one influencer draped over their Humble Crumble creme brulee. Rather, it’s a gratifyingly traditional, classy dining room that could be from the 1950s, with a tiny bar, counter seating and a little service hatch at the back sending out a short, meaningful menu influenced by provincial French dining. Camille is run by Clare Lattin and Tom Hill, founders of Ducksoup in Soho, Little Duck The Picklery in Dalston and, most recently, Emilia in Ashburton, south Devon, alongside Ratnesh Bagdai, co-founder of Brindisa. It is also a showcase for the skills of chef Elliot Hashtroudi, who seems to have taken his experience from St John, packed it into the boot of a Citroën 2CV and driven the back roads all the way from Bayeux to Marseille while smoking Gauloises and trying to work out what everyone’s grand-mère is cooking. Disclaimer: there will be copious amounts of garlic in the sauces and dressings, and you will leave whiffy and unsnoggable. Also expect snail butter, boudin noir, trotter in the terrine and poached ox tongue. If you’re the sort of person who went on a school French exchange, avoided the pig’s jowl, chicory and mysterious lumpy sausages and survived on smuggled Penguin biscuits, you may find Camille a little testing. Lately they’ve had atriaux on the menu, or, as I call them, “mystery sausagemeat meatballs”, because you never get the same answer twice from any French or Swiss chef as to what, exactly, they contain, although pig’s liver and parsley seem key; at Camille, they’re served on a soft, rich slick of puy lentils. On first impression, there is nothing all that remarkable about Camille; it seems like a rather anonymous, unplush room serving langoustines, devilled eggs and butter tart, all of which you can get in at least 10 other “hot” London settings right now. But, as Hashtroudi began feeding each plate through the wall from his hectic kitchen, I suddenly got the sense that this is a truly great little restaurant. First up, good, mustardy devilled eggs with vibrant orange innards topped with pungent, smoky eel to eat alongside a basket of fresh baguette slathered in salty butter. Next, an unwisely generous portion of buttery roast jerusalem artichokes piled high with a feathery, light mountain of grated Lincolnshire poacher: so delicious – although this is your biannual reminder from me that the jerusalem artichoke, albeit one of the most delicious vegetables on Earth, is neither an artichoke nor anything to do with Jerusalem; it’s the tuber of an American sunflower and creates wild amounts of methane in the gut. The quantity of garlic in the sauce with the langoustines off the specials board and the punchy yeast dressing on the grilled Tenderstem broccoli were similarly antisocial. Thankfully, I have nothing on this week. Even the ice-cream of the day, should you desire a palate cleanse, was made from rollright, a pungent, oozy British cheese. I ate two whole scoops of this salty, cheesy, oddly soothing stuff. Before that, as a main, we shared a Hereford onglet, served rare-ish with Cafe de Paris butter (which seems to be on menus everywhere right now) and a side of potato pavé with hay mayo. Pavé is a bit like a taller, more thinly sliced, drier dauphinois, and Hashtroudi serves his in thick blocks that resemble custard mille-feuille, to scrape through lamb’s liver with crisp bacon or charred calçots with anchovy hollandaise. The pudding list, meanwhile, is an equally wild ride. Alongside that rollright ice-cream, there’s Yorkshire custard with rhubarb, chocolate bun, bergkäse and canelé with prune. I really didn’t need an extra pudding, but I tolerated a slice of exceptional burnt milk tart. Camille is simply a good restaurant. Take your influencer buddies, leave them doing star jumps by the falafel stall in the market, and go and get yourself some proper dinner. Camille 2-3 Stoney Street, London SE1, 020-3794 8958.

They were always on the telly back in the 1970s, on shows such as That’s Life! and The Good Old Days, belting out Knees up Mother Brown and offering a route back to a golden time when all of London loved jellied eels and the pavements were clogged with folk doing the Lambeth Walk. Pearly Queen, the restaurant, instead takes a regal attitude to the likes of Carlingford Lough and Gallagher Atlantics, and serves them with scotch bonnet hot sauce and lime. It also serves crisp buffalo oysters, which involve dredging Carlingford number twos in panko breadcrumbs, deep-frying them at 190C, then drizzling them with a sauce made with sriracha and clarified butter, and finishing the whole, crisp, jammy, hot, salty mess with ranch dressing. Pearly Queen isn’t slap-bang in the middle of Shoreditch’s head-thumping epicentre, but is instead, and rather wisely, down the quieter end, between Aldgate and Spitalfields, and opposite the fantastic pulled noodle spot Xian Biang Biang Noodles and the ever-reliable Sunday lunch spot The Culpeper. Just like chef Tom Brown’s first solo restaurant, Cornerstone, his new place isn’t terribly formal, even if the food is certainly serious. There are no strings of pearls or cummerbunds required, but you’ll definitely need the capacity to eat Cornish brill poached in squid stock and butter, with a potato velouté and white asparagus and dotted with squid ink, or cuttlefish lasagne topped with a 36-month aged parmesan-enriched bechamel. Brown’s head chef here is Patrick Maher, ex of Orwell Road in Dublin and the Peligoni Club in Zakynthos, Greece, and his team dish up painstakingly thought-over creations, from the very first hunk of sourdough with seaweed butter to the deftly chopped chalk stream trout tartare topped with an egg yolk. More nouvelle dishes include crab meat transformed into the world’s most decadent ball of arancini with an oozing, buttery centre, much like a chicken kiev, and mash with Guinness and oyster gravy, in which the slightly bitter, black jus dances enticingly around silky pommes puree. There is two Michelin star-level ingenuity going on here, even when they’re only slinging oysters in the deep-fat fryer or doling out bread. Yes, you could just stick to oysters and cocktails and have a lovely time, but you could also try the oyster paté, which is piped back into its shell and topped with champagne jelly and purslane. Put simply, there will be things at Pearly Queen, as at Cornerstone, that you will never have eaten elsewhere, though that’s not to say you won’t do in future, once other people shamelessly rip them off. On a Friday lunchtime in early spring, the room was sedate, but the playlist was a nonstop cavalcade of post-punk and 80s indie: PiL, Gang of Four, Siouxsie and the Banshees, the Cure … Thank God we’re seeing the back of restaurants parping out Kenny G-lite, when they could instead be playing Psycho Killer by Talking Heads or whipping me into a melancholic haze with The Headmaster Ritual by the Smiths. I drank only fizzy water, because I am a saint, but the cocktail list is curated by Max Venning of Three Sheets in Dalston and features pearly martinis laced with picpoul and a pearl onion or bucks fizz made with clementine, fig leaf and almond. They also sell Hattingley Valley sparkling by the glass and, if you’re booze-free and want to feel grown up, they will make you a non-alcoholic seaside soda with Everleaf Marine, salt cordial and tonic. My enduring memories of Pearly Queen revolve around two things in particular: a monkfish tail in a rich XO sauce that is patently deepened with shellfish, and a dessert of warm gingerbread and Cashel Blue cheese – another novel combination that makes so much sense now that I’ve thought about it. They’ve also been known to offer desserts featuring a gold goblet filled with custard ice-cream, forced rhubarb and ginger biscuit crumbs, and positively wicked warm sticky toffee madeleines covered in butterscotch sauce and thick cream. Pearly Queen is not cheap, because nowhere lovely is these days, but it is a paean to fine British ingredients, and to splurging on butter and decadent dining. Sure, if you were to try to swim the Channel after eating at this fishy establishment, you’d sink to the bottom very quickly, weighed down with paté, cream and panko crumbs – but what a way to go.

Woolway is from Swansea, and passionate about fanning the flames of the local food scene.

But it does feel like a slice of living, breathing, everyday Wales, with a diminished town centre grappling to find new purpose. Yes, there are bits that look rather forgotten and shabby, with numerous boarded-up shopfronts, but there are also sleek, hopeful areas such as the SA1 Waterfront Area, which is where Woolway and his team are now showcasing Welsh produce and the future of local culinary talent. Do not by any means expect a St John replica. The Shed is essentially 16 years of Woolway’s homesickness on a plate, complete with a laverbread garnish. There may be no whole roast suckling pigs on platters or Eccles cakes with lancashire cheese to please the St John fanboys, but there are offally, mysterious faggots with sides of chips and greens or a salad of Cae Tân leaves. There was also, when I visited, a breadcrumbed, fatty, lamb rissole draped in a runny-yolked fried egg with a puddle of sweet, fiery homemade brown sauce. On other days, that same sauce may be served with mangalitsa blood cake. The Shed does make attempts to cater to vegetarians, too – a lovely bowl of thickly cut roast squash atop a stew of puy lentils topped with ewe’s cheese, say, soft-boiled eggs with fennel, or leek soup with local wild garlic – but I think it’s safe to say that this is more of a place for farm-to-fork lovers keen to eat every mooing, baa-ing tasty thing from across the Gower Peninsula, the Brecon Beacons, Herefordshire, and the lush farmland of West Wales and the Monmouthshire borders. Considering I had made the long-suffering Charles endure a six-hour round trip from London to Swansea and back just to eat lunch, he still says the Shed’s lamb chops, served on a mound of peppery mashed turnip, were absolutely worth every minute. On a Friday lunchtime, trade was healthy, with slabs of welsh rarebit flying out of the open kitchen. And if you are ever going to eat a welsh rarebit, then make sure it’s Jonathan Woolway’s, because he just knows what he’s talking about. His oozy slabs of cheesy heaven come with a bottle of Lee &amp; Perrins so you can add it to taste. A plate of pickled sardines to start were fresh and vibrant, with glistening, silver skins and a vinegar hit that knocked us sideways. One surprising dish, which seemed on paper to amount to very little, was a simple plate of gurnard fillet in a very light tempura batter with a warm, melting salad of anchovy, radicchio and spring onion. That may sound a bit peculiar, and it was most definitely odd, but I can’t forget the crisp, hot fish and the salty pungent salad. If you’re a vegetarian and feel a little short-changed by the starters and mains on offer, may I recommend just sitting quietly and waiting for dessert, because the Shed’s pudding list is almost as long as the mains and contains a whole lot of treasure. We – or, more accurately, I – managed a slice of chocolate terrine, with a quenelle of creme fraiche just to provide some refuge from the intense chocolate bombardment. We (sorry, I) also managed a slice of vivid-green pistachio cake with slices of pretty, pink poached forced rhubarb. In fact, the Shed’s regularly changing dessert menu has made me even today linger on the internet, looking for any updates, with one hand hovering over the train timetable: blood orange trifle, marmalade bread-and-butter pudding, baked egg custard, chocolate and honey choux bun – and that’s just in the past week alone. In a world of depressing pudding lists that speak meekly of sticky toffee pudding and homemade sorbet, the Shed really goes hard before you go home.

Sure, this thoroughfare may well be one of the nicest places in London to waste three to six hours over lunch, drinking vermouth and eating ice-cream, but it’s still a hard sell to tourists. “Did you know that Moro was the birthplace of the British small plate?” I tell people, brightly. “And it’s so close to Sadler’s Wells, too!” Reactions are generally muted, but those naysayers will now miss out on Morchella, a new place by the people behind the much-loved Perilla up in Stoke Newington, which recently appeared on the corner of Rosebery Avenue inside an imposing, former late-Victorian bank. In recent years, this gargantuan space with its high ceilings has been leased by various pizza restaurants, so you’d expect that by now its yesteryear charm might have been somewhat flattened, but, oddly, it’s quite the opposite. In fact, due to Morchella’s revamp using natural wood herringbone floors, the ghosts of the London &amp; South Western bank have never been so present. What those ghosts might make of Morchella’s plates of salt-baked poussin and spanakopita, or its staff whizzing about in what looks like bottle-green haute couture prison garb, is anyone’s guess. The menu is a short, ever-changing list of reimagined Mediterranean classics. That sounds a little terrifying, I know, because who wants a riff on spaghetti vongole or panzanella? Well, it turns out, I do. Plus, it’s hard to argue with Morchella’s salt cod “churros”. God bless this earthly meeting of fish and doughnut; so crisp, so hot, so pungent. Much the same goes for the spanakopita, which is often served in hefty, ribsticking lumps, but here comes as dainty finger-food, with a rich, pond-green spinach filling wrapped in paper-thin pastry. These two “snacks” are essentially canapes on steroids. This kitchen, which is led by Daniel Fletcher, is turning out an intense mix of decadent, surprising, weird and usually utterly triumphant dishes. Before coming, a scan of the menu had me hoodwinked that the place was channelling “relaxed and groovy Med vibes” with the likes of hake with sobrasada and a side of parmentier potatoes. That promised sunny, breezily served food to recreate warmer European climes. But nothing is slapdash or by chance at Morchella. It has one of those kitchens where the chefs care so much about the exact positioning of the vitello tonnato, it’s physically painful. No one is hurling pieces of monkfish at a cuttlefish stew in a “this will do” manner. This is not Club Med. Rather, it’s the Square in Speedos with a bucket and spade. Other opening snacks include plates of good-quality coppa, mussels served pil pil style and hunks of freshly baked, spongey focaccia strewn with pepper dulse seaweed, or “the truffle of the sea” as it’s sometimes known. Later on, fat Orkney scallops arrive in their shells, topped with poached cauliflower and mushroom, and dotted with black pepper. A crunchy radicchio salad turns up power-dressed in garlic. Yet despite all these serious flavours, Morchella also appears to be family-friendly – on the weekend we visited, there were lots of babies, lots of grans and lots of prams. Even an unadventurous eater would warm to the short-rib, baked slowly until soft, and topped generously with pickled, earthy, aged mushrooms. The result is extraordinary: this is a dish that looks like something dreamed up by JRR Tolkien, and is a rich mix of vinegary, piquant joy and soft, yielding beef. The meat-free, meanwhile, should try the parmigiana panzerotto, because it turns out that a calzone really does take on new life when fried. The dessert list is short and sweet. On the day we went, there was a freshly made lemon tart and a stinky gorgonzola with mustard fruits, both of which we need to go back for. Instead, we went for the pudding that will probably make all other puddings in 2024 seem lacklustre, namely blood orange and black olive portokalopita. This was stubby, fat, dense, glossy lump of what appeared to be sponge but was actually filo dough injected with syrup, which gave it a rather old-fashioned, suet pudding-like consistency. I’m a sucker for any posh pudding that feels as if it could have been steamed in the tin – plus, yes, it turns out that you can put black olives in a pudding, especially if you then serve it with a wonky quenelle of cream flecked with lemon zest. Sweet, slightly bitter, decadent and, thanks to the chopped orange, one of your five a day. So, sure, Exmouth Market may not be as well known or popular as Covent Garden or Notting Hill. But when it comes to eating lunch, I know where I’d rather be. Morchella 84-86 Rosebery Avenue, London EC1, 020-7916 0492. Open lunch Weds-Sat noon-2.30pm; dinner Tues-Sat 5.30-10pm; Sun noon-6.30pm.

I grew up about 250 miles from St James’s in central London, where handmade shoe boutiques nestle beside bespoke fedora specialists, and where the local corner shop is Fortnum &amp; Mason’s food hall. However, via the tabloids, the goings on at Le Caprice often played out in my living room in Carlisle. Behold, HRH Diana, sleek and coquettish, striding into Le Caprice for her bang bang chicken, perhaps dining alongside megastars Mick Jagger, Liz Taylor and Nina Myskow. I guzzled that sophisticated-sounding bang bang chicken vicariously, then headed off to the local Brewers Fayre for my breaded scampi. Now, on the old Le Caprice site, after closures and some management swapsies, Arlington is here. Some might say not a lot has changed: the decor, menu, clientele, Mayfair money, yacht tans, facelifts and the general sense that many of the diners here are merely passing through London this week, after Gstaad and before Cannes, and checking in on their Mayfair townhouses. Who is going to cook for themselves when you’re on a schedule like that? At Arlington, people table-hop, air-kiss and still eat bang bang chicken, which is just a runnier version of chicken satay, as I learned to my puzzlement on reaching London in the 1990s. It’s satisfying, sweet, crunchy, chickeny stodge, although Arlington’s version has a delectable undertone of barbecue sauce. You might well order that chicken as a starter before the salmon fishcake with sorrel sauce entree and a bowl of rhubarb crumble with custard to finish. Jerry Hall’s next husband could manage almost the whole menu without putting in teeth. That isn’t a criticism, but more a note on the misapprehension that, back in the 1990s, the moneyed and marvellous swarmed the Ivy, the Wolseley, Le Caprice et al for the complex cooking. They did not. They chose these Coutts-standard canteens for their exclusivity, for the shield they provided from the hoi polloi and for the menus filled with risotto nero, dressed crab and chocolate mousse. They still do. Arlington is a place for people who want tablecloths, lemon wedges wrapped in muslin, endive with roquefort, and all-day poached eggs on muffins. Basically, this is good-quality, spruced-up nursery food for those who find mastication arduous. All that said, Arlington is a terrific place to waste a few hours, sip a coastal martini and eat some well-coloured on-the-shell scallops backstroking in garlic butter. You can peruse the David Bailey portraits on every wall; even when you go to powder your nose in the ladies’ loo, you’re overlooked by an imperious Jean Shrimpton. Of course we had the bang bang chicken, garnished with sesame seeds and some flung-about coriander. I began eating it daintily, with a knife and fork, but soon gave up. This is a scoop-and-shovel kind of dish and, due to its sweetness and shards of roast peanut, a delicious one at that. Fish and chips were a less successful choice, despite the fearsomely impressive-looking piece of haddock. The batter was not up to much at all, and couldn’t be rectified no matter how much salt I threw at it; at least its accompanying tartare sauce had great zeal. A main of tuna loin was seared on the outside and dark pink through the middle, and came on spiced al dente lentils – nicely judged, if not especially exciting. Arlington’s caesar salad, however, which comprises large unchopped romaine lettuce leaves, croutons, decidedly non-dainty chunks of parmesan and a draping of good anchovies, is showstoppingly good. Both of our puddings were truly fantastic, too. Who knew that something as everyday-sounding as “mousse aux deux chocolats” – or two large quenelles of milk and white chocolate mousse – could be such a highlight? It’s almost as if, for decades now, this same room has been serving spoilt, grown-up babies the things they actually want, and I now count myself among them. When you’re offered rhubarb crumble here, it won’t be deconstructed or a playful riff on the old-school classic. No, instead, it is a moist, sweet, pink rhubarb crumble, tipped out on to a plate for you and served with a jug of vanilla custard. The crumble-to-fruit ratio is half and half, as any sane person knows is correct. Arlington does Britain’s best crumble, and I’ve thought about it hourly ever since. There are certainly better restaurants, dining-wise, in St James’s, but few are as interesting or infantilising to spend time in. Arlington is a new place doing the same old things. It ain’t broke, and neither is its the clientele, so nobody needs to fix it. Arlington 20 Arlington Street, London SW1, 020-3856 1000. Open Mon-Fri, lunch noon- 3pm, dinner 5.30-11pm; Sat &amp; Sun, brunch 11am-4pm, dinner 5.30-11pm (10pm Sun). From about £55 a head for three courses, plus drinks and service.

Starters £4-£13, mains £10-£45, desserts £8-£12, wines (500ml) from £18 Towards the bottom of the main course options at Medlock Canteen in Manchester is a dish that reads “staff dinner (limited availability)”. It costs £10. I ask our waiter what it is. “Exactly what it sounds like,” Tom says, cheerily. “The staff food is so much better here than I’m used to. Usually, it’s chicken nuggets. Not here. Today it was a pea risotto. We’ve had leek and bacon pie, and a cottage pie. It’s great.” They just happen to make enough to sell a few portions to the punters, too, though today they’ve already run out. No worries. There are other things worth ordering. It is a quiet and sweet way by which to make a statement. A lot of restaurants have abused the language of egalitarianism over the years, to signpost that they are democratising the whole socially stratified business of eating out, when their gilded ambitions and appetites are very much elsewhere. Marco Pierre White’s second restaurant was a place called the Canteen, when it was nothing of the sort. It opened in the 90s and was co-owned by Michael Caine, because the god of British film stars wanted somewhere to eat. It won a Michelin star for a humble menu of oysters with champagne sabayon and escalope of seabass with a parsley crust. Likewise, the equally starred River Café is many delightful things, but a caff it is not. The Medlock Canteen, named after the river overlooked by the Deansgate Square development of which it is a part, is also not a greasy spoon. But there really is something thoroughly come-one-come-all about its “morning-noon-night” proposition. It’s there in the tea towels for napkins and the wipe-clean tables, the concrete shell of a room with its midcentury modern wood cladding and the furniture. The room has a smart, utilitarian look, aided by the light green floor, the colour of chocolate lime sweets, which hints gently at the institutional. The oxblood leather banquettes remind me of the cherished 12-hole DMs I wore when I was a flat-footed youth. Mostly, though, it lies in the menu. You can come here for beans on toast and a “bottomless batch brew” first thing. You can stay for a steak sandwich or something bigger from the rotisserie. What you will not get are gimmicks or spins or, God help us, twists. Nothing is twisted. Nothing is spun. There’s nothing intrinsically special about the offering at the Medlock Canteen and that’s what makes it so special. What you read on the menu is exactly what you get: a set of appealing, familiar dishes that are the best versions of themselves. It’s a departure for chef Sam Grainger. At Belzan and Madre in Liverpool, he offers complexity and whizz-bangery. His team in the kitchen here worked previously at Manteca in London, doing bold and radical things to Roman classics. Now they are proving that, while restless flights of imagination can be great, simple, good taste and technique can be better. We have perfectly made duck rillettes with a heap of pickled vegetables heavy with tarragon, alongside a well-oiled slab of sourdough toast. There are fat, salty anchovies to be coiled on to bread and potato croquettes, at £3 each, perched on a dollop of truffled mayo, showered with nutty Alpine cheese and sprinkled with chives. We move on to half a rotisserie chicken for £14 and it is everything those words promise and don’t always deliver. No special rubs or sauces. Just roast chicken, rested long enough for the meat to start shrugging itself off the bones. The skin is crisp and salty. But what makes it is what they call chicken jus and what I’m going to call gravy, what with this being Manchester and all. It is dark and sticky and deeply savoury. It is tip-the-platter-and-spoon-it-away good. It is sipping gravy, which is the best kind of gravy. Even if you don’t order any chicken, order that and pour it over everything. Pour it over a friend. There’s a charcoal-grilled fish of the day, which this evening is a whole lemon sole for £24. It’s a seriously skilled piece of fish grilling. The lightly gelatinous skin on the darker side, where the thicker fillets are, has been gently grilled so the pearlescent flesh comes away easily. The white side has been given a spanking from the flames and is dark and blistered. We have a pot of salsa verde to go with it, which is salty and sharp and the perfect foil to the fish. Alongside, there is a pillow of mash flavoured with beurre noisette, and carrots glazed with honey and grain mustard, a burst of Christmas amid the whisper of spring. The sides also include fried eggs “served all day”. For all your fried egg needs. A rhubarb pie arrives hot from the deep fryer, crusted with rhubarb-flavoured sugar. It floats in the middle of a thick, frothy marsh of custard. It is a school dinner pudding, raised to a place of glory and wonder. You could easily get yourself through double maths thinking it. There’s a pistachio frangipane tart, deep-filled and with a crisp surface that gives way to squidgy depths. On the side is a dollop of granny smith purée. Across the top is a white quilt of crème fraîche. It is balanced and very satisfying. Medlock describes itself as a cross between a French bistro and an American diner. The references are smart. Take a seat at the counter and, in the falling light of a Manchester dusk, you could easily form a tableau that the painter Edward Hopper, the chronicler of the diner, would recognise. Or head to the entirely French wine list, with a strong offering by the 500ml carafe, and you could act out the Parisian part with a glass of sauvignon from Bordeaux. Manchester has been in the grip of a building boom for a while now, which has divided local opinion. The way the priapic tower blocks pierce the cloud-quilted skies encourages questions about what exactly these property moguls are compensating for. Sharp, modern complexes like this aren’t exactly warm and inviting. The space occupied by Medlock Canteen is so over-engineered that, unless you put your back into it, you might find pulling open the huge glass door tricky. Often staff scuttled forwards to finish the job for baffled customers. Rest assured, even if the area doesn’t feel finished, even if it lacks anything approaching human scale, there is at least the thoroughly humane embrace of the Medlock Canteen. News bites Birmingham-based chef Brad Carter, who closed his flagship restaurant Carters of Moseley last year with plans to relocate into central Birmingham, has announced a new project. This summer he is opening Undercroft, a restaurant in the crypt of Saint George’s, a church in London’s Mayfair. Dishes will include wild garlic chicken toast to start, followed by Tamworth pork with creamed snails and BBQ aged duck. Meanwhile, the rest of his team are running a venture inside 103 Colmore Row, a private members’ club in Birmingham. It has become a tradition that this column announces the start each year of the Streetsmart campaign which, in the run-up to Christmas, raises funds to tackle homelessness across the UK by putting a voluntary £1 levy on the bill of every table at hundreds of participating restaurants. It’s delightful to report that for the first time in its 25-year history the most recent campaign raised more than £1m. It is, of course, also depressing that such a campaign is needed at all. Visit streetsmart.org.uk. Early tickets have gone on sale for the Dorset Seafood Festival, which takes place this year across the weekend of 7 and 8 September on the Weymouth Peninsula.

The restaurant’s sleek website offers all sorts of bold statements about this hot dining experience (regular readers will be aware that I delight in this kind of Vogon poetry), claiming that it will take us on a “gastronomic journey throughout Asia that transcends ordinary flavours”, and offering cocktails that will “awaken your senses”. The website emotes grandly in this way for many more yards, so much so, in fact, that I suspect AI. Only a non-sentient being could describe Canterbury’s Riverside as a “vibrant new lifestyle district”, when it’s just an elevated patch of concrete. Maybe Sekkoya is entitled to be cocky, though, because it’s clearly the classiest venue for miles: the place is bedecked in sea-green velour, with shiny floors, pale tan leather seats and an impressive “mural” skylight that gives the impression that you’re dining in a rainforest. Fans of the opulent Chinese restaurant chain Tattu, which is especially big in Manchester, Birmingham and Leeds, will recognise dashes of the modern, high-octane glamour that delights Instagram feeds. Add beautiful bathrooms, Kool &amp; The Gang and George Benson on the stereo, and lovely, chipper serving staff, and they clearly mean business here. Yet, as soon as our first plate arrived – a beautiful-looking Thai salad that on the very first forkful revealed itself to be a big mound of wildly under-dressed cabbage – alarm bells started to ring. If only the food offering were as ballsy as the decor. The “small plates” section of the menu lists chicken wings, edamame, iceberg lettuce salad and prawn or vegetable tempura, which makes a trip to Wagamama seem like a street-food jaunt with Anthony Bourdain. This menu seems to assume that its customers have only ever experienced “abroad” on Google Street View. The small plates menu also features a robata selection of chicken satay, grilled padrón peppers or lamb in ginger and black bean sauce. The menu then moves to steamed gyoza – I had the vegetable ones, which came swimming in soy and a black, sticky snot that was apparently truffle. Actually, truffle does a lot of heavy lifting on Sekoyya’s menu – it’s there in the miso truffle tagliatelle and on the truffle and parmesan fries, too. There are also Korean bao buns with miso crispy aubergine, hoisin chicken, peppered beef or grilled duck. They jammed my aubergine bao into a toast rack inside a bamboo basket, but the bun was of such poor quality that it couldn’t be extracted without disintegrating, by which time all the tempura batter had fallen off the aubergine and I began to suspect we were being filmed by TikTok pranksters. Sekkoya is a prime example of why the term “pan-Asian” fills me with such foreboding these days. In its original sense, the phrase meant a culinary extravaganza in which the chefs showed off their discoveries from the 23 provinces of China, with a few highlights from Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia thrown in. It was an umbrella term for big, delicious, spicy, sticky and umami. Sekkoya, however, serves large plates of chicken udon, pork ribs in “Japanese-style bbq sauce” and truffle soy rib eye, and makes you think that someone here is deliberately diluting pan-Asian hits and serving them in their safest possible form. It’s the sort of Asian food that was invented for British people and that you’d get at a Cantonese restaurant in Braintree in 1994. I had hoped that my main course of masala cod would be the moment things turned around, but its green marinade tasted of precisely nothing: no garlic, no ginger, no chilli, no coriander – nothing. I sought refuge in the pickles that came with it, and relished every second of their mild, vinegary zing. I’d decided against eating this with chips, so went for one of the only other suitable side options, steamed rice, which was totally unseasoned, but there was a lot of it and it did come in a lovely bowl. “Is it worth looking at the dessert menu?” I asked our server. “Oh yes, it’s very exciting,” came the reply, with what I couldn’t be sure was a straight face. It featured ice-cream and sorbet, yuzu cheesecake, chocolate brownie and those bought-in mochi rice-cake ice-cream balls that pan-Asian restaurants often serve as their only dessert to bore you into leaving early because they want to turn your table. Ha! They wouldn’t shake me off that easily here, and my mango mochi ice-cream ball was the loveliest thing I ate that day; Sekkoya serves them with vanilla ice-cream. Gosh, this is some menu writing, but Sekkoya is sort-of-Asian, and the food’s definitely cooked in a pan, so, technically, they’re not lying.

Yet, from my table in the new Portobello Road branch, the love is not reciprocated. Solo dining is one of my specialist subjects, and my advice for lone wolves hoping for a walk-in anywhere is to turn up slightly earlier than the rush, when the staff are likely to be less fractious and dismissive of you turning up to clutter a table. Poppies starts serving its famous fish and chips from 11am, so I arrived 10 minutes before noon. Once inside, and as usual when I’m on my tod, I scan the room so I’m able to dispute whichever dismal crevice the server might try to stuff me in. By the toilet door? Next to the Epos machine? In this all-new Poppies, the worst seats out of the 64 available are those next to the open front door, where the queue is sorted into takeaway and eat-in diners. Armed with the knowledge that I’m intending to spend about £30 on regular fish with chips and a slice of apple pie, I fight the server’s urge to seat me there. “How about there or there?” I ask, pointing a hand towards a couple of nicer spots, but he seems to have suddenly become acutely myopic. While all this is going on, in the background the sound system is playing quirky, Noël Coward-esque ditties, the fryers are bubbling gently, and there are Sarson’s malt vinegar and farty tomato sauce bottles on every table. Staff are dressed in natty white jackets and there are jellied eels and Cartmel sticky toffee pudding on the menu, so I concentrate on the positives, rather than on the wind now blowing my bouffant. Poppies, which started out in London’s East End 60 years ago, has a fine reputation for its fish and chips, but has of late slipped into Harry Ramsden’s territory, offering a rosy, yesteryear take on what the Good Old British Chippy used to be: think battered saveloy and chips with a side order of Disney or Paddington. This new Portobello Market-friendly branch is full of tourists, possibly having their first ever taste of our most famous fayre: battered sausages, plates of bread and butter, and jugs of Bisto gravy (yes, it’s even branded on the menu). If the Italians sitting near me looked confused at their pricey plates of sepia stodge, I can’t blame them. Chippy food is the coddling stuff of this small, wet island, and it is dear to my heart, because it perked up a cold, beige, northern childhood. Chic sorts dressed in Balenciaga will never write home effusively to Napoli about mushy peas and bowls of authentic Heinz beans and, after eating here, neither will they come away much the wiser about how we salt of the earth folk once ate. According to the website, Poppies offers a slice of “London’s rich culinary history”, but then serves “seasonal salad”, grilled mackerel and margaritas to passers-by who can’t see how wildly inauthentic all this is. Also, a pedant would tell Poppies that chips with curry sauce or gravy were never part of southern culinary history; southerners used to like their chips offensively dry, and it was the north that educated them otherwise. Such opinions have led me to eat £1.75 pickled eggs alone in restaurants. Food is plonked down. The egg, cut in half and served in a bowl with a sprig of parsley, is inoffensively pickled, and I need a pickled egg to cause me genuine pain via its soaking of malt vinegar; I also need the yolk to be grey or mauve. A regular cod, about as big as my hand and served with roughly 40 chips, costs £18.95 and comes with a small pot of bland tartare sauce. The fish is nicely cooked, but the batter is too light and needs lots of salt. Curry sauce, which is bang-on-the-money 1980s chip shop-style stuff, is an extra £3.50 and inexplicably turns up in a dessert bowl. It’s all fine, but only fine, and I want to chivvy everyone in the place – the Italians, the Americans, the Japanese – on to a coach and take them to Stranraer to eat vast bundles of salty chips and thickly battered fish that sticks to newspaper. There will be no mojitos, but we can instead all share a bottle of Barr’s Scotch Cola, wiping the rim as we go. “Can I have some apple pie?” I ask my waiter, who ignores me as if I am on day release. “No, we do not have pie,” he says. “OK, how about sticky toffee pudding, or just ice-cream?” I say. He looks pained: “No, there are no puddings today,” he says. “Pudding is more of a night thing,” and promptly disappears. I sense they all wish I’d disappear, too. The temerity of me taking up space in this prime piece of real estate with my demands for a scoop of vanilla. I stand my ground and try another waiter: “Are you not doing any desserts today?” “Yes!” he says, but then falters. “I mean, no.” “Yes or no?” I ask. “No,” he says. “And why is that?” “Um, suppliers,” he says. “Try another day.” The solo diner’s life can be one of humiliation. I shan’t be going back to Poppies. They’ve had their chips. Poppies 152-154 Portobello Road, London W11, 020-4568 7720. Open all week, 11am-11pm.

Today’s young may be eschewing the vices of yesteryear – booze, ciggies, drugs, etc – but their Achilles heel is sugar. Build a cafe that serves short stacks of chunky, fat pancakes smothered in banoffee syrup and topped with mini meringues, shards of tempered chocolate, quenelles of thick cream and microplaned lemon zest, and they will come. Post a video on TikTok of someone blowtorching said pancake stack, so the meringue browns and gives the whole hot mess a baked alaska vibe, however, and your customers will queue from 8am for the chance to make their own content next to the fake plastic trees “growing” inside the cafe. Sugar is the most cheerily pernicious of vices. I come from a long line of bingo-winged, eccles cake-addicted Methodist women who wear smock dresses, so I am condemned by my DNA to seek out plentiful bowls of apple crumble pancakes with spiced fruit. No calories are printed on Apple Butter Cafe’s menu – not on the creme brulee french toast nor the croissant butter pudding with custard and pecan nuts. Both dishes, I suspect, would make a diabetes doctor sigh anxiously. That said, one benefit of Apple Butter Cafe’s new Langham Place branch is that it is a mere hop, skip and jump from Harley Street, though those in the medical profession may well see “hopping” as your destiny after too much vanilla cheesecake or saffron milk cake in a custardy puddle strewn with petals. None of this central London, influencer-friendly theatre is cheap. Mushed avocado on toast has had a bad rap for its wicked role in the housing crisis, so just wait until the grownups find out about Apple Butter Cafe’s black forest pancakes with chocolate sauce, cherry compote and gold powder dusting that cost £14.50 plus service. This wanton expenditure on pure pleasure will send some onlookers berserk, but then, when the world isn’t particularly sweet, sometimes we all need a sharp blast of teeth-chattering, sugary goo. There is something wildly childish and hyper-real about Apple Butter’s daily special pancake offering that seems to take the edge off normal life. My stack of blueberry pancakes consisted of three discs at least an inch thick, all drenched in blueberry syrup and topped with a handful of poached berries and a large slab of Cookie Monster-blue chocolate. The first pancake was delicious, the second was verging on overindulgence and, midway through the third, my mood changed to one of defeat, shame, regret and biliousness. Which is not exactly ideal when the bill for two comes in at more than £80. That bill creeps up thanks to the likes of fancy sesame lattes at £6.50 and Turkish coffee at £7 a cup. The sesame latte, incidentally, is eerily grey, is served in a beautiful glass and tastes like delicious caffeinated tahini. The turmeric, charcoal and creme brulee lattes are equally pretty and punchily priced. Still, service is perfunctory, the tables are stark and undressed, and the savoury dishes rather uninspiring, so it’s worth noting that breakfast at nearby Claridge’s comes in at roughly the same price, though there they bring the food with the correct amount of forks and spoons, and don’t squirt the tables with spray cleaner mid-service, as if you were in some greasy spoon. We ordered togarashi scrambled eggs – two eggs on a sesame bagel with a sort of okonomiyaki-style mayo – for £16.50, though the eggs were an omelette rather than scrambled, and I failed to detect the togarashi seven-spice blend anywhere. The £18.50 barbecue beef sandwich was even more surprising, because what came was a hotdog-style brioche bun with a light filling of beefy mush and a side of fries. The plate looked mighty bare when it arrived, so might I suggest a salad garnish to fill all that empty space, and in so doing spare Apple Butter’s blushes? This special-occasion cafe excels with its elegantly sugary grotesqueness – pancakes with Biscoff, pancakes with Oreos. Oh, and trifle made with acai berries (for health!), topped with cream and custard and served in an aesthetically pleasing retro jar that makes me forgive these blighters for all their crimes. I had eaten all of the daily calorie allowance for a grown woman by 10am, and in 42 minutes flat, too, and spent the rest of the day as a vision of sheepishness and indigestion. Apple Butter Cafe’s pancakes are last supper material. And, if you went every day, that could be sooner than you think. Apple Butter Cafe 4-5 Langham Place, London W1.

If you don’t know your “wildfarmed laffa” from your spanakopita gratin with malawach, or your giouvetsi beef-fat pangrattato from your mussel saganaki with tsalafouti, then this will be, literally, all Greek to you. At Oma, the server’s “Do you want any help with the menu?” is greeted with an emphatic “Yes!” How is the laffa wild, but also farmed, and why is it in the bread section? I’ll tell you how: the flour for the laffa is farmed, but without pesticides, and it’s then turned into a salty, pillowy, buttery flatbread to swoosh through Oma’s showstopping bowls of hummus, babaghanoush and labneh. Yes, I did just call hummus showstopping there, but that’s what happens when David Carter of Smokestak and Manteca and Ecuadorian chef Jorge Paredes, formerly of Sabor in Mayfair, spend 18 months tinkering with the recipe before serving their hummus masabacha-style – that is, much smoother and runnier than you may be used to. Crunchy chickpeas swim in this silky custard, which is topped with a spicy, bright green coriander zhoug. To the untrained eye, Oma is just another chic, semi-industrial space with an artisan cake kiosk and a cocktail bar on the outskirts of Borough Market; yes, the very market that I’ve already described as a Harry Potter Diagon Alley-esque theme park with extra venison sausage. But Oma is different from most other places round these parts. It is a nerdish, painstakingly thought-out, relaxed but high-end Greek-ish space-age taverna up a flight of stairs, and overlooking the melee outside. You enter Oma through its downstairs bar, Agora, which is noisier, less structured and has a slightly different but equally complex menu at slightly smaller prices. It’s not a restaurant, but it isn’t really a bar, either. The whole vibe down here is “bedlam plus charcoal pork souvlaki skewers”. Upstairs at Oma feels much more like an elegant night out, where you can sit at a proper table, sip a clementine gimlet, eat raw fish crudo and feast on the glossy, otherworldly bagel-like acma verde and scoop it through labneh topped with salt cod XO. Oma’s menu seems pretty straightforward – there are breads, dips, that raw fish, a few small plates, some skewers and a few larger dishes cooked in clay pots – but then an innocuous-sounding dip such as the “ajvar with mizithra and hazelnuts” turns out to be a compellingly intoxicating goo of red bell pepper and aubergine with crunchy, salty nuts, which you eat with a bowl of hot, fresh potato crisps. Oma doesn’t stand on ceremony – it’s not a place for ballgowns, cummerbunds or even high heels, especially if you keep in mind the trek to the bathrooms, which are underneath Agora and through a part of the kitchen (I managed to stroll through staff supper on my way back from spending a penny). Carter and his co-conspirators, however, have a knack of creating incredibly laid-back but gastronomically highfalutin joints. There’s a reason customers queue and squabble for seats at Smokestak, an equally industrial space over in Shoreditch that serves brisket buns and old fashioneds in a postcode saturated by draughty joints selling “dirty food” to “hip kids”. At Oma, however, gilt-head bream, sea bass, yellowfin tuna and chalk stream trout are served fresh, raw and dressed, but the devil is in the details – in the dressings of datterini tomato, apple aguachile, Todoli citrus, jalapeño granita and clementine ponzu. Anyone who finds it hard to pace themselves will find the breads, sauces and citrussy fishy loveliness very hard to resist, but you simply must leave room for the deconstructed spanakopita, which, frankly, is obscene. The traditional cheesy spinach filling is baked separately in an earthenware bowl, and the whole holy mess comes with light strips of moist, hot malawach bread to dredge through it. From the clay pot offerings, the dish already causing a stir is the wild red prawn giouvetsi, a sort of Greek risotto made with orzo that’s finished with a wildly decadent deep-fried prawn butter. The result is a glossy, set, incredibly fishy puddle that teeters on the brink of too much. Then again, nothing ever feels like too much at dinner, does it? It’s only the next day, as you step into a pair of suddenly snug pants, that you think, “Did my chargrilled squid skewers really need that extra splash of delicious za’atar oil?” and “When I was that full already, did I need those two large scoops of gorgeous olive oil ice-cream dusted with fennel pollen? And in what way was that any different from eating an entire cold rice pudding?” No difference, is the answer. Oma is one of the restaurant openings of the year, not least because literally no one was crying out for a fresh spin on babaghanoush. We were all very, very stupid.

It is a burly, noisy, brown-stone city with a rep for piercing the bubble of anything that is up itself, but there has always been a sleek underbelly of glam to these streets. Only quietly, mind. Brett, for example, on a corner of Great Western Road, sets out its stall as the polar opposite of a lofty, intimidating restaurant. It’s just a wine bar that happens to throw down a little beef fillet with jersey royals. Pop by for a birthday cocktail, the website seems to say, we’ll cook you a bit of pasta or fish, all while pointing at a menu that includes the likes of fresh linguine tossed in XO-infused mushroom sauce and caramelised leek, and topped with plump Cantabrian anchovies. This is not remotely pub grub and more, “We mean business here – bring a bib!” See also Brett’s gildas, based on that rough-and-ready northern Spanish pintxo bar snack of chilli, olive and anchovy shoved on a cocktail stick; here, however, the gilda is served on a luxurious plinth of chicken fat-encrusted crouton, and the olive and anchovy come with a nerdily engineered hot sauce. So, yes, you could come to Brett simply to sit up at the bar and savour the lengthy biodynamic wine list, or sip a corpse fizz with Roku gin and absinthe, but you’d be missing a trick. Despite its self-effacing charm, Brett is actually the younger sibling of fine-dining Cail Bruich a little further up Great Western Road. What’s more, Brett’s chef director is Colin Anderson, formerly of Restaurant Gordon Ramsay in London, so it’s probably worth checking what he’s got on the specials. On the evening we visited, there was prime chateaubriand, which we ate with a side of jersey royals drenched in a seasonal and sensational wild garlic and chicken butter emulsion. Those potatoes were a vibrant green, alien visitation, an explosion of umami finished with an elderflower vinegar gel. One perplexing thing about the place, however, is quite how little space they have to achieve all this. It’s just a small single room with a mezzanine at one end, a busy counter with at least eight cooks behind it, and diners, drinkers and servers all milling about. I’ve seen bigger places than this struggle to send out a club sandwich, yet here they make some of the most complex and intriguing starters I’ve eaten all year. A generous bowl of Orkney scallops, fried until golden and served in a macadamia nut cream, come in a scallop consommé with finger lime and coastal greens. Delicate, painstakingly boned chicken wings are served with tiny, salty clams in a rich, smoked chicken emulsion and dotted with a fiery scotch bonnet sauce. There are hunks of white bloomer from Edinburgh’s much-loved Company Bakery, both to scoop through those sauces or to smear with butter whipped with, yes, more chicken fat. Not one scrap of chicken seems to be binned at Brett. Waste not, want not, and all that. While Brett resolutely holds a fig leaf over its fanciness, as if to say, “Don’t mind us, we’re just rendering down some Angus beef fat while plating côte de porc with langoustine sauce and yellow carrot. Nothing to see here!”, it is very possibly Glasgow’s best restaurant right now. The service is great – warm, relaxed, proud of how delicious the food is, and always there, while also not being there at all. On a warm Friday night in Glasgow, which is always a bit magical, I can think of no better spot than one of the tables in Brett’s window, to sit, eat and watch the passing nightlife. A monkfish tail main was poached in butter and came with chunks of fennel confit’d in bergamot gel and a brown butter sauce. It was comfort food with the chef’s foot fully on the gas – the genius of the dish is that the thick sauce is filled with extra tail meat dressed with shaved raw fennel. If I’d paced myself, we’d have ordered the pink lady apple tarte tatin with caramel sauce and Madagascan vanilla ice-cream. Instead, we went for something we hoped might be smaller, though the menu description – “Cluizel 63% chocolate and Highland Park 12” – provided no clue to the fact that it’s a perilously decadent bowl of warm chocolate mousse concealing a frozen cultured cream and layers of whisky-laced salted caramel. I defy anyone to finish it on their own, because this dessert requires a team effort. Stay hydrated, loosen a button, work from the centre with large greedy swipes, and enjoy the rich, balmy, boozy excess. You’ll probably have to walk home from Brett to work off all the calories, but if you live in Inverness, you might just manage it. Brett 321 Great Western Road, Glasgow G4, 0141-406 0284.

Mind you, there is room for a restaurant to spread its legs in London E14. The newish Hawksmoor just along the wharf is also enormous, while the nearby Dishoom is another behemoth with added bacon naan. Roe is the second incarnation of the much-loved Fallow in St James’, which is known for its peculiar, yet ultimately delicious nose-to-tail, cheek-to-bumhole, low-intervention-style menu. Fallow, at least to begin with, had about it a rather worthy, Greta Thunberg with a Leith’s diploma vibe that sent a certain type of foodie giddy with joy. Fallow’s signature dish is a cod’s head doused in sriracha butter, and its beady eye glowers at you while you eat your kombu fries. In fact, I’ve felt a bit like Hamlet in high heels every time I’ve eaten there. Alas, poor Coddy, I knew him. New kid Roe, however, is a bigger, slicker, marginally less edgy version of Fallow, probably because E14 is the beating heart of the UK’s financial world and the audience round here doesn’t care if you’re trying to save Mother Earth one repurposed dairy cow called Hilda at a time. City people just need the burger, which at Roe contains both beef and venison, to be delicious. They also want their steaks to be 35-day, dry-aged and with XO mushroom sauce, plus a deep-fried blooming onion smothered in garlic mayo on the side. Oh, and a big slab of Tunworth cheesecake for afters. Massive, assertive flavours in a hulking football pitch of a restaurant. Did I mention that the place has 500 covers? This is a restaurant for people who like other people. A misanthrope invited to Roe would probably need to be struck down by a diplomatic dose of chickenpox. But while the place is far from intimate, the food sent out from the heavily populated open kitchen is made with true geeky precision. The menu screams “crowdpleasers cooked as you’ve never seen them before”. There’s a baked potato dish that I vow to eat again and again every time I return; it’s a baked, buttery spud in a bowl of rich cheese sauce, topped with shoestring fries and dotted with sweet, brown kombu ketchup. There’s a hen of the woods burger for vegetarians, featuring a brioche bun filled with a decadent, deep-fried mushroom patty, cheese, lettuce and shallot. Pillowy flatbreads come with various toppings – posh pizzas, if you like, though these salty, oil-drizzled, slightly charred breads come with scallops and bacon butter and the rather terrifying-sounding “snail vindaloo” with mint yoghurt. Roe’s menu dances rather daintily and deftly between “pub grub”, “fever dream” and “Noma”. Octopus and sausage skewers with samphire and sea bream tartare with tiger milk sit alongside a Cornish pasty and a side of salt and pepper fries for anyone who finds haute cuisine a bit daunting. The place is kind of mad, but it’s also mass-market and, ergo, sheer bloody genius. And if you’re wondering if they’ll have space for you and your friends, the answer is a resounding yes, because, as I’ve already said, Roe is bigger than some former Soviet-era Russian states. Right now, I really can’t think of a nicer informal lunch than Roe’s spring vegetable, ricotta and mint flatbread with a round of lemon verbena swizzles or gooseberry daiquiris off the cocktail list, and especially not if it could be taken on the outdoor terrace. For a larger table, you wouldn’t go far wrong by also ordering the very good satay chicken wing skewers, a couple of bowls of the pretty breaded mushrooms with a fierce aïoli and the house-made charcuterie plate with cornichons. We ate indoors at a lovely, spacious table with plenty of elbow room, and ordered a beautifully dressed sea bream tartare arranged delicately with apple and radish, that spring flatbread loaded high with asparagus, the jacket spud dish, fresh peas and ricotta, an Isle of Wight tomato salad and the mushroom burger, which eventually defeated me. Even so, Roe’s dessert menu is, I regret to say, unavoidable. They make a posh Viennetta with mint ice-cream, chocolate and marigold, though, unlike the “bad”, factory-made Vienetta that you needed a bread knife to cut, Roe’s version is delicate, luxurious and tastes of fresh mint. It’s well worth a whirl, though personally I’d go back for the caramelised banana parfait with nutty toffee sauce. It’s a sort-of-heavenly deconstructed banoffee pie complete with a clever optical illusion, though I won’t spoil that surprise for you. Nobody ever had Canary Wharf down as a future restaurant hotspot, but now Roe has come along to join the growing crowd and prove that a restaurant can be big as well as clever.

Nobody, back in the blue-sky-thinking days of opening a joint, has ever planned to open a stinker. Restaurants are perilously expensive ventures. Pop stars KLF may once have burned £1m on Jura, but at least they got to go to bed afterwards. Hospitality, however, never sleeps, so if, like Solynka Dumas and Julian Oschmann, you are burning money by opening a 44-cover, all-day German/Swiss dining experience at the hectic end of London’s Charlotte Street, you’ll be pretty tied up. The pair’s new restaurant in the heart of Fitzrovia is decked out in sumptuous, sunset-hued suede and leather, and offers a list of low-intervention wines that’s apparently curated by that wine-world name du jour, Honey Spencer. July also splashed the cash on employing someone to take lovely snaps of its Alsace-themed fantasy menu, including yummy-looking breaded deep-fried munster , pork terrine, herb dumplings in broth, exquisite salads, lamb hearts with green sauce, and white asparagus with ham and hollandaise. The dreamy list goes on: at weekends, I’m told, there will be whole Fosse Meadow chickens with homemade mayo, which I imagined as a bit like Bob Fosse chickens, having danced wild and free, and built up plenty of lovely, tasty flesh. Dumas and Oschmann may never have run a restaurant before at any level, but, according to the marketing spiel, they loved having friends over when they lived in Berlin and are in the business of “thoughtful hosting”, which apparently means that July is “a real passion project, born out of a shared love for entertaining, and using hospitality to create connections and long-lasting memories”. Absolutely no lies were told there. My two visits were truly unforgettable. My first error was to visit on a Tuesday lunchtime and expect to eat any of the aforementioned delicious Alsatian offerings. There was only a small, punchy menu of four items, one being that well-loved classic, sourdough baguette filled with chunks of cauliflower, for £12.50; or a lilliputian portion of cheese tarte for £12. There was also roast beef and horseradish baguette – the real taste of Alsace – and a miserly slice of hazelnut cake smeared with chocolate spread for £8. My guest necked a walnut old fashioned – very good, sweet, powerful – to quell their disappointment. “I do apologise,” I said, staring puzzled at my cauliflower sandwich. “I thought they served, well, food.” Apart from one other person sipping wine, we were the only guests. There is possibly a connection between the harrowing dearth of clientele and July’s decision to offer only weird, unappetising, hard-to-chew, overpriced baguettes at lunchtime. It’s a sort of M&amp;S meal deal for Coutts cardholders on some type of high-fibre purge. I sympathise with them, though – cooking lunch is a bit of a faff, isn’t it? People will turn up, be a nuisance, and spoil all that thoughtful hosting and long-lasting memories. On the Saturday night, I return for dinner with a different guest, because the first one was no longer speaking to me, hoping to experience the full majesty of Alsatian cuisine. We are, again, the only guests, other than a bunch of hedge-fund types drinking low-intervention wine on the terrace outside. A lovely server brings us the food menu, which is, again, brief. There’s the fancy chicken to share for £45, served with salad and spuds, as well as – hooray! – that deep-fried munster. There’s some not great trout rillettes with thin, spindly croutons, and some very mustardy devilled eggs. Puddings are the miser’s hazelnut cake again, and a crepe. The cheese arrives uncooked. It’s just a slab cut from the block and served with a few pickles. Lighting the stove is clearly too arduous. Then the chicken arrives. “This is half a chicken,” my guest says on seeing one breast, one leg and one wing in a bowl of thin jus with a small bowl of forgettable pink fir potatoes, some wilted greens and a bowl of salad. At this point, the two owners appear, wearing their coats and wishing their meagre clientele all the best for our evening, before disappearing into the night with the hedge funders outside. Joyful memories and great connections were definitely created that night, just not in Dumas and Oschmann’s restaurant, where I sat wondering where our other half a chicken had gone and why my crepe was cold. July has become a real bugbear to me: the restaurant that existed only in the minds of its owners and the people they paid to conjure it up. Dumas, whose family have a major stake in the French luxury brand Hermès, can clearly afford not to care if her restaurant thoroughly disappoints its customers. She can even afford to upset me, because I am but one small woman asking for her cheese to be fried. And for the amount of money sloshing about this passion project, she can definitely afford to send out whole chickens. July, 10 Charlotte Street, London W1, 07498 905 392.

It sets out this fact pleasingly plainly on its website. Cloth’s clarity on this matter is refreshing, because, despite my job as a restaurant critic, it seems I spend far less time eating out than I do barking at my laptop about this trend to be cagey, opaque and mostly shut. “But when are you actually open?” I regularly find myself quacking. “When, when, when?” The modern, cool restaurant, you see, prefers to offer page after online page of TS Eliot-style tracts about the chef’s culinary journey and the restaurant’s attitudes to biodiverse composting, with no mention at all of what point in the week they switch on the stoves, which often turns out to be around Thursday lunchtime. At Cloth, however, you very much get the feeling that they are sweeping away all that nonsense and leaving behind the bare bones of good, modern British hospitality. Namely: a table, a great glass or two of wine, and an interesting, hearty, ever-changing menu featuring duck terrine with pickled walnut, comte tart, monkfish with Cornish mussels and sea beet, Amalfi lemon tart and a heavenly chocolate mousse with salted caramel ice-cream. Cloth takes Dorset crab and mixes it with creamy celeriac and almonds, and it serves Norfolk chicken with creamed potatoes and wild garlic. This is comfort food made with the finest ingredients and cooked with largesse – there is deliberate generosity here with the oil, the cream, the butter and the sweet syrup. There’s no concept, no journey, no servers asking you to name your favourite dishes so far, as if you’ve enrolled in a quiz rather than come for a spot of lunch. You eat in a Grade II-listed building, behind a black-painted, olde worlde shop frontage in which one could imagine Bagpuss sitting waiting for Emily. This end of Cloth Fair, the street, partly survived the Great Fire of London and, decor-wise, very little seems to have been done to this space since, apart from maybe the addition of a few strategically placed marble tables, and walls painted a muted bottle-green and hung with dusty cartography. Owners Joe Haynes and Ben Butterworth are wine importers, both with their own fields of expertise – roughly speaking, Butterworth leans more towards France and Haynes to Germany. Neither of them is a slick, brash, front-of-house person; instead, they are earnestly endearing wine-lovers now working alongside chef Tom Hurst, formerly of the Marksman, Levan and Brawn, to create something really quite special. You may remember I said that Cloth was hot and hyped, but rarely in the real world does that indicate anything tangible, rather than somewhere with a marketing budget to dispense a lot of free meals to freeloaders. From the moment a plate of humble-sounding “house pickles” appeared, however, I realised that Hurst had entered some sort of imperial cheffing phase, because those sweet, miso-soaked mushrooms and sharp, pickled carrots and cucumber were clearly not spooned from a jar, but rather fermented with the utmost care; they were especially delicious with a round of oysters in an apple dashi and a plate of housemade bread. Next came buffalo mozzarella with white peach, pine nuts and mint, which was far more profound than the sum of its parts, and a bizarre-sounding but marvellous bowl of chunky bull’s heart tomato in a silky, pale, stonkingly good tonnato sauce that was vibrant with anchovy. Cloth’s is an understated menu that, on paper, I’d probably never rush across town for. The lines “longhorn rump with roast onion” and “Cornish gurnard with asparagus” do not give much away, but that onion is caramelised, soft in all the right places and charred in others, and comes atop a hunk of rare beef surrounded by a “jus” that, let’s be honest, was more an actual gravy with depth and heft, through which you’d quite happily drag espelette-peppered chips. The mush of crunchy seasonal asparagus and fresh peas beneath the golden-skinned, perfectly judged gurnard was bathed in an exemplary vin jaune sauce. There’s nothing hokey, disappointing or out of a tin at Cloth, and my only regrets are not ordering two rounds of those pickles and agreeing to share the mousse; and now, informing even more people about this rather buzzy restaurant that, like almost nowhere wonderful inside the M25 right now, is actually open on Mondays and Tuesdays. Cloth blazes bright and fast all week long, serving the highest standards of modern British cooking and a nerdy wine list, so they deserve Saturdays off to wash their aprons and Sundays to rest, like gods.

Roux has since said that he does not plan to cook much at all from now on: daytime TV and caring for his grandkids are much more his penchant these days, he says, rather than sweating over homard grillé and salsifi au beurre noisette. And who can blame him? Fine-dining restaurants may be glamorous, but cooking in them is hot, filthy, smelly and often thankless. Roux deserves endless happy, horizontal moments wearing his athleisure pants while solving the ad-break conundrums on Countdown, but where that leaves Chez Roux is something of an enigma. It operates evenings-only in the Palm Court space of the hotel, which cannot fail to feel chintzy no matter how much they spend on modernist objets d’art, because its tables are rather low and the accompanying velvet chairs are on the low side, too. This is the sort of low table you more commonly associate with a seaside fortune teller, and causes even a titch of a woman such as myself to stoop over her lemon sole meunière. The Palm Court claims to be the birthplace of the “dazzling tradition of afternoon tea” since 1865, which I fully believe, because this twinkly, matronly room really does lend itself to spending perhaps an hour and a half over a cake-stand of scones, though perhaps not the three hours it took us to eat our way through the five-course tasting menu. Thankfully, the ladies’ room is so very far away from the Palm Court – just past Acton, it seems – that you can shake off any pins and needles en route. The menu is apparently inspired by Roux’s childhood memories of life in rural Kent in the 1960s, when his late father Albert worked for the aristocratic Cazalet family. Roux Jr has been at pains to say that he’s no longer chasing Michelin stars, which is possibly a device by which to manage the expectations of the Le Gavroche faithful, who might head here in search of his famous soufflé Suissesse or filet de chevreuil rôti with échalotes confites, only to find the far simpler likes of salmon rillettes with jersey royal salad and beef fillet with peppercorn sauce, plus communal colcannon for the table. This is a menu of posh comfort food for the weary, moneybags traveller, tired of the experimental fusion journeys that many five-star hotels now foist upon visiting millionaires, and in need of an à la carte menu featuring roast spring chicken with stuffing or roast lamb with a “glazed faggot”. I’d happily spend all evening watching surprised American tourists come across that menu listing. The tasting menu, meanwhile, consists of daintier versions of the regular carte, namely the rillettes, the lemon sole, the beef, some cheese and rice pudding. My advice would be to go à la carte, because the crisp, soft, lemon sole meunière with lemon, capers and brown shrimp is utterly delicious, as is the rare Buccleuch beef fillet in a rich cognac and peppercorn sauce. So much so, in fact, that I wish I’d ordered either of those dishes full size, rather than as the bite-sized tasting portions we got, and which forced us to endure a cheese course – a dull piece of stichelton, some cheddar and a few oatcakes – followed by a dessert of creamy vanilla rice, which turned out to be cold rice pudding perked up by some crystallised pistachios and redcurrant coulis, but still cold rice pudding nonetheless – which is absolutely tolerable, but only if eaten from a tin during a power cut. Service was patchy – precise, at first, with our allergies and dietary requirements taken at the front desk when we arrived at 7.15pm, but that seemed to have been forgotten by 7.40pm, when the amuse-bouche arrived. My notes describe that as “a posh Tuc cracker with squirty cheese”, though it was, of course, a little fancier than that. During the rice pudding course, we became all but invisible: three attempts to ask for the bill were completely ignored, with the front of house far too engrossed in moving the tables about, until I did a thing I often do, which is rear up on my hind legs and approach a member of staff like a fractious triffid. The bill eventually came, but was completely wrong, and after begging to pay the correct amount I was finally allowed to go home at about 11pm. Somewhere out there, the great Michel Roux Jr was lying on his sofa, watching telly, eating snacks and nowhere near his restaurant. His was by far the better evening. Chez Roux The Langham, 1C Portland Place, London W1, 020-7636 1000. Open all week 7-9pm (last orders).

Tasting menu £85-£115, drink pairing £35-£50 I discover the giddying power a restaurant reviewer wields, not over restaurateurs, but over my husband. “We get a free meal!” I tell him, provoking great rejoicing. “It’s an ‘immersive’ experience,” I add; silence. “The chef was on Great British Menu, you know, that show where they serve liver in pencil cases and stuff,” I inform him, sadistically; there’s a guttural sound. He shouldn’t be so stricken. Watching people cook elaborately is our hobby; we spend an unhealthy number of hours watching split bearnaise drama and fondant jeopardy. There’s nothing unusual in that: fancy food has become entertainment; we’re all sofa sous-chefs after three seasons of The Bear and 9 million of MasterChef. But there’s entertainment, and there’s dinner. But our only haute cuisine experience – a po-faced Michelin-starred marathon in an Alpine barn – was traumatic. My husband still talks sorrowfully about the groaning cheese trolley he was too broken-spirited to tackle after 20-plus tortuous courses, featuring liquefied tartiflette served in a milk carton and sea urchin meringue. So onwards, with apprehension, to Harrogate, where GBM alumnus Adam Degg’s new baby, Fifty Two, is hidden somewhere in a labyrinthine country house hotel complex (the kind offering the triple threat of conferencing, golf and spa). We blunder round a squat black shipping container with no obvious entrance until we reach a glass-fronted, blond-wood and copper suggestion of a restaurant, where we’re handed an aperitif and superior cheesy biscuit and sent to wander the kitchen garden. It’s this garden and its 52 raised beds of organic produce that Degg’s new concept celebrates, and the ravishing mosaics of greenery and corn, thickets of flowering chive and broad bean and espaliered cascades of currants are certainly spectacular. The crowd is Harrogate-smart (stealth wealth with a touch of sparkle) and palpably tentative about embarking on a 10-course, £115 “experience” where the only choice is whether you want your drinks pairing (£50) to be alcoholic or not. In a post-The Menu world, the spectre of a murderous Ralph Fiennes casts a chill shadow over immersive gastronomy. Will we have to scan QR codes? Forage our own garnishes? Fight to the death with microplane graters? But once we’re seated at shared tables, expectantly facing Degg and three colleagues, we’re only asked to immerse ourselves in a Sylvanian Family-chic apple blini with cod’s roe and hot pink radish, wearing a nasturtium leaf hat. That’s reassuring, but the real exhalation comes when one of the chefs delivers what he calls “chips and dip”. It’s ultra-luxe: a floofy cloud of sour cream and dill (esprit de Pringles) over a chunky ragout of jerusalem artichokes, which are also deep-fried as the “chips”. There’s something comfortingly familiar about watching people cook while troughing down crisps; so much so, I almost absent-mindedly dredge the bowl clean with my finger. Dark-golden fermented potato brioche rolls, ceremoniously pulled from the oven, destroy our last shreds of reserve; we duel over who gets first dunk in the whipped sunflower seeds, cultured butter and salsa verde; we squabble over who finishes each. Now we couch potatoes can relax, watching our food take painstaking shape, then demolishing it. There’s too much for a blow-by-blow, but a riff on eel, mash and liquor is a standout: a smoked, bronze chunk on a confit potato in a pond of silky green beurre blanc, topped with thistledown-thin crispy potato filaments and tongue-tingling powdered vinegar and parsley. An unpromising-sounding pre-dessert – nuggets of last year’s chewy beetroot in blackberry juice under a scoop of goat’s milk ice-cream – is bafflingly brilliant: earthy, clean, sweet and tart. You can tell Degg used to be a pastry chef. His dark-crusted, brown-butter custard tart dusted with star anise and nutmeg sugar shimmies, threatening collapse, at the slightest spoon nudge; pine caramel adds resinous complexity. Not everything works. A deep-fried gherkin served with other sour bits and piccalilli is a pickle too far, the batter not crisp enough to offer contrast. Cod with overly sweet magnolia blossom is texturally off, and the accompanying magnolia blossom overly sweet; it tastes like a work in progress (Degg confirms it’s a new dish). The non-alcoholic drinks pairing is admirable, but needs tweaking: as designated driver, if I’d finished the first three large, sweet offerings served – a sakura soda, blackberry-elderflower-lemon, then apple-cucumber-dill juice – I would have been sloshing with liquid and hyperglycaemic before pudding. Some of the vegetarian options (which I order, also tasting my husband’s omnivorous version, since I am A Professional) deliver: a “take on Branston pickle” sounds ominous but offers the crunch and sweetness of new season green things; the freshest garden leaves with chewy croutons are astonishing. But I get the same amuse bouche twice and while it’s nice hearing that the gardener produced a sole early cauliflower that was slow-roasted just for me, it’s seriously under-seasoned. And on a £115 menu, don’t charge £6.50 for water; serve tap, for goodness sake. But we visit in week seven after opening and all that is eminently fixable. There’s so much more right than wrong, not just with food, but with everything: Degg cooks and hosts with disarming charm and generosity. The “signature sharing” lamb is gloriously, almost ridiculously, OTT: there’s slow-cooked saddle and a hibachi-charred kebab, and spiced navarin topped with a wild garlic foam and crunchy sweetbreads over smoked rosemary. Plus, a salad. It’s tasting menu vibes, Yorkshire portions. But what Degg has nailed above all, is that elusive beast, the experience. He’s obviously deeply serious about his food (at one point I count three chefs tweezing away simultaneously), but equally so about atmosphere. You can’t be too po-faced when you’re toasting meringues with naked flames: this is as far from chilly, ego-driven cooking-as-theatre as you could imagine. The quality and quantity of food and drink (boozers get three excellent cocktails and two wines, regularly topped up) means that by dessert, cheeks are pink, smiles broad and belts slackened. Chairs shuffle closer together and strangers start chatting; we’re encouraged to choose songs for “dessert island discs”, at which point two young women start schooling their 60-something tablemates on Taylor Swift and a mini-Mexican wave breaks out. By the time Degg comes over offering warm, cherry-sugar-dusted madeleines, my neighbour is coaching me so intensely on overcoming my fear of failure, we absent-mindedly grab a handful and smash through them like he’s our mate passing round M&amp;Ms (they’re infinitely tastier). He seems delighted. Fifty Two is better than fancy food as entertainment: it’s honest-to-goodness fun.

The very thought will probably shake earnest foodie readers to their core. Albert’s Schloss, you see, is all about fun: noisy, determined, oom-pah-pah fun. It is also about wall-to-wall schnitzel, strudel and currywurst. Eat bacon kroissant royale from 9am and schweinshaxe on a Sunday. There’s a live house band from 4-7pm every night, followed by a nightly “Kunst Cabaret” with singalong piano, dancing ladies, DJs and, of course, more oom-pah-pah. So much endless oom-pah-pah, in fact, that never will one’s oom be so triumphantly pah-pahed. No tickets required and, says the website, everyone welcome. “No thank you, Mr Schloss,” you might well be thinking while sliding under the bed. “Please keep your Weimar Republic-themed booze stampede away from me. It sounds noisy and prone to spillages.” Even so, most people I’ve met who have visited one of the other Albert’s Schlosses in Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham have fond, albeit woozy memories of late nights and perhaps a little too much Erdinger Weissbier, Stiegl-Goldbräu or Früli beer. They talk of booze, spätzle and fried goods covered in melted Alpine cheese, taken at long benches while sitting next to strangers who only recently became best mates. Nobody ever woke up and thanked God that they’d discovered the rhubarb and custard sour or the quietly lethal and bright blue show bunny, because both of these drinks require you to line your stomach first, perhaps with one of Albert’s Schloss’s giant pretzels with sweet mustard and pickles. The jalapeño pretzel is the best: a hunk of warm, spicy carbs with a variety of dippy things that’s hard not to love. And here’s the thing: the food at Albert’s Schloss is really much, much better than it needs to be, especially this close to Leicester Square. I popped in for a weekday lunch at 1pm and stayed for three hours, dining in a cosy, magnificently camp, fake Bavarian cable car. At some time during dessert – a very good, stacked chocolate cheesecake with raspberry coulis, incidentally – a man in a singlet climbed up on stage, said, “2,2,2”, into a mic and played Mustang Sally. It was 4pm on a Thursday, and the cabaret had opened. We’d toyed with the idea of ordering the fondue with extra bratwurst, but instead went for cordon bleu schnitzel, which had gruyère and prosciutto under its breadcrumb coat and came with wild mushroom and brandy sauce and truffle fries. If that sounds a bit bloody much, it absolutely was. The side of sformato – truffled cheese mash – was rib-stickingly decadent, too. The biggest surprise, however, was the schweinshaxe pork knuckle laden with a huge, crisp piece of crackling. The meat was seasoned with juniper, caraway, fennel and black pepper, and it was served with red cabbage, apple sauce and gravy. I had imagined that the food here would be like a Bavarian-themed Wetherspoon, where the ping of the microwave delivered cheap, cheerful stodge. Instead, there’s a meaningful drive here to establish Albert’s Schloss as a proper all-day restaurant, with an intriguing, thoughtful and playful menu where Berliner shawarma salad sits happily alongside chickpea fattoush, salt beef reuben and vegan wurst. However, it’s the “everyone welcome”, “endlessly open” and “usually something happening” that’s the special sauce at Albert’s Schloss. Isn’t that music to the ears of anyone planning a small group trip to London? No booking required, no credit card deposit, no dress code, no time slot. London is difficult for the outsider: expensive, exclusive and impenetrable. Everything is happening everywhere, apparently – but it’s just not for the likes of you … well, unless you like waxworks. Building an Albert’s Schloss just off Leicester Square, where a tourist cannot help but trip over it, is a stroke of genius. Bring them your hopeless, bedraggled hen nights, your travelling college football teams and everyone else hoping to enjoy “swinging London” and grimly considering a Shakespearean hip-hop walking tour. Albert’s Schloss will save these people from a night of queueing for M&amp;M World. It is a deeply silly point of refuge, an oasis, a cold pint of Pilsner Urquell and a woman in a sparkly bra singing a Liza Minnelli medley. It’s not cool, it’s not going to appear in any lofty, food scene guidebooks, but it’s clean, welcoming, and has friendly staff and nonstop giant pretzels. I had more fun here than I’ve had at many a Michelin-starred restaurant. And that’s quite wunderbar. Albert’s Schloss 20-24 Shaftesbury Avenue, London W1, 020-8165 0000.

One is a new-ish all-day Uzbek street food joint OshPaz, where manty and plov are served by ladies in cute, traditional embroidered hats. The other, close by, is a branch of Pizza Hut. One early afternoon in late July, when the world and its grandmother needed lunch after going to see Eros, guess which one had a queue snaking out of the door and which one did not? Yes, clearly the former was Pizza Hut, with its £13.99 a head unlimited “buffet” bundle, complete with access to the “ice-cream factory” with freeflowing Mr Whippy and bubblegum sauce. OshPaz, by comparison, was delightfully underpopulated: walk-ins welcome, solo diners treasured. Bliss. That’s not by any means a dig at any one who chooses to “hit the Hut” – pizza has its place, after all, especially if you need to feed the kids – but it’s also a reminder that Uzbek cuisine is not at all mainstream. This landlocked Central Asian country has 35 million inhabitants and a worldwide diaspora, but few people in the UK know much about lag-man, samsy pastries and cream-drenched manty. The latter’s lack of wider popularity is especially bewildering, because, well, who doesn’t love a dumpling? OshPaz’s manty have thin, wobbly skins holding beef, chicken or pumpkin seasoned with cumin and coriander. They’re wrapped into delicate, pretty, plump packages and steamed for 40 or so minutes, until they’re ready to serve with carrot salad, soured cream and, if you like, chilli oil. I can’t vouch for the authenticity or otherwise of dipping an Uzbek manty into Japanese-style chilli oil, but there you go – these manty are, roughly speaking, Middle Eastern koftas inside Chinese xiaolongbao dough. That said, and in a bid to prevent an international incident, I’ll stop blurring precious foodstuffs now. Neither, heaven forbid, will I take a guess at who influenced who here. What I will say, though, is that if you ever fancy losing three glorious hours of life, you could do a lot worse than spend them researching Uzbek plov, in which long-grain white rice merges with chicken or lamb, onion, carrot, raisins, paprika, whole garlic heads and perhaps a few chillies. Let’s avoid a pan-global bunfight over the minutiae of Indian pilau, Pakistani pulao, Afghan pilaf and so on. Which is better? Who ripped off whom? And at what point on the Silk Road circa AD138 did some bright spark first simmer rice with meat and think, “We’re on to a winner here”? Better, I think, simply to visit OshPaz, pull up a chair or a stool at the counter, order the lamb plov (or the chicken or vegan variety) with fresh achichiq chuchuk (tomato and cucumber salad) and minted soured cream. Sip from a pot of milky masala tea flavoured with honey, cinnamon and ginger, and keep a cool, clear head. Try the manty, too, and the samsy – buttery, flaky puff pastry enveloping cumin-spiced lamb. Yes, you might find yourself wondering where the samsy ends and the samosa starts, and where the Caribbean patty and the Cornish pasty enter the game. But I don’t have a dog in this fight, merely the appetite of a famished great dane, which comes in handy if you also order the chicken lag-man, or fried noodles in a spicy broth, which are, to my mind, the stars of the show here. The advertised “broth” is nothing of the sort, though. Rather, it is a thick, hearty stew with chunks of pepper, celery, onion and some chilli. OshPaz is small – I’m calling it a restaurant only due to the smart, uniformed table service, but in truth it’s more a cafe that also does takeaway. Owner Muzaffar Sadykov has worked tirelessly since 2009, when he turned up in the UK, initially to study IT before making it his life’s mission to teach us the joy of Uzbek cooking. He started with various street food stalls and pop-ups across London, then moved on to more semi-permanent bases at Seven Dials Market in Covent Garden and Mercato Metropolitano in Borough. Now he has rocked up here with a bricks-and-mortar site in London’s West End, where he’s not only competing with Pizza Hut, but also St James’ rather more glitzy esablishments. Yes, the menu is brief – some rice, some noodles, some steamed dumplings and some baked ones – but service is quick and there’s a vegan option for everything. There are no desserts, no limitless candy sprinkles and no buffet with a chicken and sweetcorn pizza congealing under a heat lamp, but what OshPaz does have is huge heart. It may take me a moment to find Uzbekistan on a map, but Piccadilly Circus? Well, even a fool can get there. OshPaz 7 Regent Street, London SW1, 07833 540306.

People who don’t know Leeds or what it’s like – let’s, for the sake of argument, call them southerners – often imagine it to be a rough-and-ready place full of brash Yorkshire pragmatists who have absolutely no time for pretentiousness. Well, they’re wrong. Leeds has always been chock-full of some of Britain’s greatest dandies, dreamers and creative crackpots. I blame the university, the Industrial Revolution and something in the drinking water from the Royd Moor Reservoir. Project House, a collaboration between several local artistic groups – Brudenell Social Club, Belgrave Music Hall, the Welcome skate store and Super Friendz – is a 1,000-person-capacity venue with a restaurant attached, and a great example of Leeds in full weird-and-wonderful mode. Go for the “equilibrium retreat”, the rave bingo, the all-day desi festival and the “bring your own brood” mass yoga sessions, and stay for a whole wood-fired chicken with confit garlic, home fries, butterhead lettuce and dip, all cooked by chef Andy Castle, previously of Ox Club, a grill restaurant 10 minutes up the road. Galleria’s menu, it has to be said, is much, much more enticing than your average arts centre cafe-bar’s – there’s not a limp slice of quiche or a thawed-out coffee and walnut cake in sight. Stale, mass-produced scones and dry ciabatta in fancy galleries are among my ultimate first world bêtes noires. At Galleria, however, the menu reads incredibly well even before a bite or slurp has been taken: three-cheese croque madame on wood-fired flatbread, southern fried bream with a kohlrabi and fenugreek remoulade, hash brown stuffed with sugar pit bacon and, on the drinks menu, smoked bloody marys. Fluffy, salty, judiciously charred flatbreads come with a variety of toppings: mortadella, smoked pineapple, mustard and jalapeño; pulled lamb’s leg with kalamata olives, black garlic and mint; or tomato, crispy chilli butter and wild oregano. These flatbreads, like all great art, take a lot of time and love to create, beginning life at least 42 hours before they’re eaten – first as a biga, an Italian pre-ferment – which is then combined with malt and water before it goes through an arduous proving process. It’s then divided into small bundles of joy, grilled over fire and served with something drizzly, something scoopable and something crunchy. Forgive me for all the detail, but Galleria’s flatbreads are truly intoxicating – they are essentially the daily bread that I spent every morning at methodist primary school asking God to give us. I ate one with whole barbecued purple carrots, blackened further by the flames and arranged like a goat’s horns, while the flatbread came dappled with scorch marks to the point of leopardprint, before being given a smear of silky, fresh hummus and a scattering of a crunchy, fiery, yet at the same time delicate take on bombay mix. When it arrived, I stared at it agog, not wanting to ruin its sheer beauty with my greed. The dish is vegan, but I defy any meat-eater to argue that it would be improved by the addition of a pork chop. A dish of Turkish eggs, ’nduja butter, whipped goat’s curd and hot honey was similarly gorgeous, and came with yoghurt, the warm, buttery, paprika notes of aleppo chilli and another of those warm, soft flatbreads to scoop through the drippy poached egg yolks that merged with the cool, balm-like garlic yoghurt sauce. Galleria’s menus from breakfast through to dinner cherrypick lovely, snacky things from around the world – from France, Greece, the USA, Asia, north Africa – but what unites them is Castle’s thoughtful, complex, fresh approach. It’s far from the cosiest restaurant you’ll ever go to – by daytime, it’s a rather starkly pale, casual space, and it’s by no means a dress-up-in-your-Sunday-best place – but then, it never claimed to be. At the same time, however, this is not a coffee spot next to a yoga hall that does eggs and posh pizza. Even if you did just pop by Galleria for a cake and a cup of Yorkshire tea, the sweet things on offer are all freshly made, and very nicely, too. We ate an incredible zesty key lime pie and a big chunk of pecan pie topped with whole nuts, both of which featured a thick, buttery pastry base.

All dishes £8.50-£24, desserts £6.50-£8, wines from £27 Over the years, I’ve come to love a pre-order. It wasn’t always the way. For a long time, I considered the whole point of restaurants to be spontaneity. At home you usually know, hours before, what you will be eating. It’s a matter of practicality; of ingredients bought and preparation begun. But you can push into a restaurant without any idea what you’ll be having for dinner. Then you get given a list. You choose. They bring. It’s a miracle. But eventually I got swept up in the calm thrills of ordering in advance. There is still a list. You still get to choose. But the delicious anticipation, the thought that there is a nice, bespoke thing in your future, is extended. This first struck me when I booked for Sunday lunch at the Lamplighter Dining Rooms in Windermere, almost a decade ago. It’s not a fancy place. It rolls its eyes at fancy. Back then it looked like your nan’s front room circa 1984, if your nan ran a B&amp;B and regularly fed Sunday lunch to 50 people. The key was the roast. I had to get my order in for the whole table by 6pm the Friday before. Honestly, knowing that someone who attends to the essentials is sorting your rib roast before the weekend has really begun is a very sweet thought. That lunch was banging. I’ve checked. They still do this. At Bokman, a knowingly rackety Bristol restaurant investigating the food of Korea, the pre-order item is a £20 tongdak or wood-fired roast chicken stuffed with sticky rice and served with dipping sauces and cubes of pickled mooli the white of cloudy ice. You have to say you want one when you book. It would seem rude not to. It means that whatever else happens there is roast chicken in my future. This is rarely a bad thing. In all other regards, Bokman, which opened late in 2019, is completely unlike the Lamplighter. The only people who would describe it as comfortable are those who have been on their feet for 12 hours straight and would pay good money to sit down on anything. There are a few canteen-style tables crammed into the tiny downstairs space, surrounded by primary-school stools, and a counter in the window with equally arse-challenging bar stools. It is a room of elbows and dishes coming over your shoulder and shouts of, “Shall I clear those to make a bit of room for you?” You pass the equally tiny kitchen on the way to the loo and there, to one side, is a sight to inspire happiness: the backlit chicken rotisserie, slowly turning like the very best of Ferris wheels. All of this suggests a bottom-up affair, but really this is all very much top down. The two chefs, husband and wife Kyu Jeong Jeon and Duncan Robertson, met while at the two Michelin star L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon in Paris, doubtless whipping inordinate amounts of butter into mashed potato and doing fiddly things with pristine langoustine. Later, they led the kitchen of a restaurant in southwest France to a Michelin star, before moving for a couple of years to Jeon’s native Seoul. Finally, they brought their young family here to Bristol and opened on this steep hill just off Stokes Croft, with its huddle of indie bars, restaurants and cafés where oat milk wins out over something from a nipple every time, as befits a constituency with a new Green MP. The menu is a tight and crowd-pleasing selection of their favourite things. Tonight, this includes a classic soy-braised short rib dish, a non-meat alternative of tofu with king oyster mushrooms and greens, and a seabass special. We start with a plate of aromatic perilla leaves, wrapped around minced beef and pork, then deep fried in a lacy, fragile batter of hot, cheery crunch. These are god-tier snacks, little pockets of joy, to be eaten as quickly as possible from the deep fat fryer, which is easy because it’s only about 5ft away over there. Dip them in the accompanying sweetened soy and mourn them when they are gone. There is the sturdy Bokman salad made with layers of Chinese leaf, toasted pine nuts, heaps of sesame seeds and a healthy ballast of toasted seaweed, lending a seashore waft to the plate. A mini cauldron of fat-grained kimchi fried rice comes laid with a frilly-edged fried egg. You can have this with shards of roasted pork belly – and you know I was always going to. Then there is that roast chicken. It is a small almost spherical bird. The skin is dark and salty, and bubbled away from the meat over the breast. Down the centre is a gash, so you can get at the dense rice stuffing, wrapped around the sweet flesh of stone-in dates that have started to crumble in the heat. For £4.50 you can get a side of crisp lettuce leaves to be used as wraps so you can eat the chicken “ssam” style, with extra condiments. This includes their own gochujang, the salty, chilli-boosted bean paste that requires months of effort to produce. Making it is a profoundly nerdy, determined thing to do, which describes the whole enterprise. The kitchen has a laser-like focus on these few very good things. The wine list is short and, this being Bristol in general and Stokes Croft in particular, is low intervention, which means cloudy, pungent and rarely cheap. Desserts include a matcha tiramisu. But there are also bowls of fluffy vanilla soft serve with various toppings. One is piled with “honey butter chips”, much like giant Crunchy Nut cornflakes; another has syrup-drenched cherries alongside the whimsy of sugar-crusted gummy cherries, which always look to me like comedy testes. If this sounds childish, guilty as charged. Dessert at Bokman is childish, in all the right grin-inducing ways. After dinner, take a stroll to the brilliantly Bristolian Turbo Island, which on its website describes itself as “an open-air social hub”, a grand name for the area’s organic and knowing chaos. Think abandoned sofas, fabulous graffiti art, impromptu bonfires and doubtless feverish arguments over plans for the revolution, when everyone can be arsed. After the advanced planning of a pre-order at Bokman, random debate with friendly strangers may just be what you need. News bites Gary Usher of the northwest’s Elite Bistros group has been crowdsourcing again. This time it wasn’t money he was after – though doubtless that will follow – but locations. He announced on social media that he wanted to open a second pub, following the success of the White Horse in Churton, Cheshire, which opened last year, and invited people to send him suggestions for pubs which were ripe for the treatment. ‘Perhaps you know someone who wants to move on from their pub,’ he wrote on X. ‘Perhaps there’s an empty pub in your village.’ The next day he declared himself inundated with suggestions.

A fortnight ago, the team behind Medlar, a well-established, 15-year-old Chelsea fine dining spot, opened a sister restaurant, Cornus, in Belgravia. That seems to me an eminently sensible age gap, not least because the road to hospitality ruin is paved with overly keen expansion that leads to everything being spread far too thinly, be that the front of house or the praline cream. At Cornus, however, there is already a real sense of judicious growth in just about every aspect of this particular rollout. First, the location: Eccleston Yards is a genteel, prettily kept courtyard of shops about seven minutes’ walk from Victoria station. Leave the traffic and the hubbub behind, and slip down an alleyway into a former power station that’s been neatly coiffed, cobbled and filled with a Hotpod Yoga studio, a cryotherapy treatment boutique and a bespoke iced biscuit emporium. If that all sounds rather frivolous and not at all rooted in “the real world”, then I’ll remind you that this is Belgravia and the residents here rarely sully themselves with common reality. Cornus is in the far corner of the yard, down a marble passageway, and has its own elevator to take you up to the top floor, where it lives in all its white, starched tablecloth majesty – 70 seats in an L-shaped room with honey fabrics and floor-to-ceiling windows draped with ivory netting. The staff are lovely, smiley and very amiable, although the place itself is a somewhat serious restaurant. The menu, meanwhile, is seriously grounded in the principles of French cooking – executive chef Gary Foulkes has worked at high-end joints such as The Square and Angler. Begin with dainty starters of handpicked Devon crab with a smattering of hass avocado, wasabi and finger lime, or a warm salad of artichokes, crispy quail’s eggs, summer beans and black Australian truffle. Move on to mains of roast Newlyn cod with persillade of Scottish girolles, grilled cuttlefish and Alsace bacon; or southdown lamb, romero pepper piperade, lamb kofte, fried capers and olives. Both of those main courses dance around the £45 mark, so the prices here are serious, too. So serious, in fact, that a tomato salad, a small portion of spaghetti with lobster and a slice of lemon tart will set you back about £80 before you’ve even glanced at the wine list; there is a complimentary gougère and good focaccia from the bread basket, though. Obviously, I am majorly underselling those three dishes. That tomato salad is made with Hubert Lacoste’s exceptional and rare heirloom tomatoes from Gers in south-western France. Monsieur Lacoste, I hear, is terrifically picky about when his tomatoes are allowed to leave his farm – so much so that only on his say-so, and not a moment before, can Foulkes even consider adorning them with goat’s curd, dressing them in cherry juice and tweezering fig leaves on top. Hubert’s tomatoes cost £20, although in the interests of transparency I paid less than that, because I visited when Cornus had only just opened. The £38 lobster spaghetti consists of delicate, hand-rolled pasta, native lobster, Amalfi lemon and a small scoop of oscietra caviar. Yes, the price is steep, but then hand-rolled spaghetti in Belgravia has never come cheap. The Amalfi lemon tart with greek yoghurt ice-cream may well be £17.50, but it’s made by Kelly Cullen, one of the UK’s brightest new names in desserts, and Cornus has cleverly snapped her up as its pastry chef, much to my chagrin because beforehand she was at Allegra, one of my locals in east London. Here, her raspberry millefeuille with lemon verbena cream and baked raspberry ice-cream is one of the highlights of the entire Cornus menu. This is not a raucous place to dance on tables or to look for all-day brunch, or indeed to leave stuffed to the gills. It’s a modern, yet defiantly old-school restaurant where you can speak, be heard and be well looked after. It isn’t trying to be youthful or on-trend, it’s just celebrating exquisite products cooked by a talented team working at a level that only a handful of people in Britain today could even hope to manage. When I visited, most of the clientele seemed to be Medlar regulars, happily ensconced in their new lunch venue, nibbling quails’ eggs and chocolate barquette. Big prices, nice tablecloths, no riff-raff: to your average Belgravian punter, that is as good as it gets. Cornus 27C Eccleston Place, London SW1, 020-3468 8751.

Winding lanes, cobbled streets, ancient history standing side-by-side with spanking new architecture … And now Ibai, a short walk from Little Britain, as mentioned in Great Expectations, and next door to the wildly underrated 901-year-old church of St Bartholomew the Great. Tourist-level prettiness: 100%. Actual tourist draw in peak-season August: zero. Not even the pigeons bother lingering around here. Specialising in Basque cuisine and serving from noon until 10pm Monday to Friday, Ibai is a brooding, gothically dramatic jewel of an 80-seat restaurant. It is capacious, as a former warehouse tends to be, with rich oak colours, crisp, white tablecloths and several vast, convivial booths for group dining. It’s sort-of industrial, sort-of fancy pirate ship and definitely striking, a mood helped very much by the fact that our Spanish server had a resplendent Salvador Dalí moustache and took our orders in the manner of Terry Gilliam in Monty Python’s Spanish Inquisition. If the food had turned out to be atrocious, I’d still go back to Ibai, because I developed a massive soft spot for the place even before I’d finished my first drink. Ibai seems to have positioned itself as a Basque-influenced steak restaurant that specialises in Galician blond rib, which for non-steak readers is a VIP cow that’s reared in a very particular way and for much longer than your typical cattle. Any steak aficionados who adore Lurra or Donostia, both co-founded by Ibai’s Nemanja Borjanović, will be aware of Txuleta, his renowned Galician meat supplier and its complex, highly textured, high-fat beef. Yet to focus purely on those fancy steaks would, I feel, misrepresent Ibai as a macho joint designed mainly for finance bros to stuff their faces with beef while swilling back old-world reds. You could, in fact, eat here without so much as touching a steak, or even meat, because it has a complex, fully formed menu of Basque and French ideas, featuring octopus, turbot, king crab and red prawns, or carabineros. If you’re feeling flush, order those prawns raw in a neat tartare, topped perhaps with some optional Oscietra caviar. The octopus is a rich, smoky spin on marmitako, a Basque tuna stew, mated with pipérade, a traditional pepper and onion stew, and the result is a dark red pot of tentacles, alliums and yielding sweet peppers in a sauce that’s made to be scooped up with baguette. In fact, some of the strongest, most unusual dishes on Ibai’s entire menu are to be found in its starters section. It would be easy, for example, to overlook “tender sweetcorn with black truffle”, thinking it all sounds a bit healthy, but it turns out to be a buttery, truffley Galician chowder that will live long in the memory. The beef tartare is uniquely, well, bright red, made vivid by espelette pepper. There’s also a “croque Ibai” sandwich, which is not for the meek, with boudin noir, melted tomme de brebis cheese and a layer of those aforementioned carabineros. For vegetarians, meanwhile, there is charred cauliflower with Ossau-Iraty cheese, hazelnuts and parsley, perhaps with a side of braised leeks with mustard. For non-vegetarians, however, it would be remiss not to try at least some of the beef, be it black angus “by Miguel Vergara from Castile and Leon”, Galician blond “by Xose Portas in Pontevedra” or full-blood wagyu from Norfolk, all cooked under the watchful eye of Richard Foster, former head chef at Chiltern Firehouse. Ibai is certainly a swanky restaurant, but it lacks any pomposity. The staff aren’t tugging their forelocks or raising an eyebrow at an elbow on the table. It’s a serious restaurant with fairly serious prices that doesn’t expect you to take life seriously. There’s very little on offer that’s picky-uppy, although if you’re dining lightly at one of the counter seats, there is a plate of noir de bigorre ham with crisps to nibble on over a glass of something red, maybe alongside some paté Basque with truffle honey. The pudding list, if the steaks don’t end you, is worth the trip alone. For one thing, there is my ultimate death-row dessert, the lesser-spotted pain perdu, here served with hazelnuts and rum, as well as a creamy, slightly wobbly gateau Basque with summer berries. Don’t write Ibai off as a steakhouse for city boys; it’s much, much more than that. This hulking Basque pleasure palace signals that opulence and living it large are very much still “in”.

Ambassadors Clubhouse is the newest Indian venture from JKS, the people behind Gymkhana and many more: BiBi, Trishna and Brigadiers, among many others. It’s no exaggeration to say that London would have a very different dining landscape without siblings Jyotin, Karam and Sunaina Sethi, so if anyone can make a go of the former Momo site, with its capacious dining room, outdoor terrace, private dining rooms and underground nightclub, it is JKS. This is a site that demands full commitment to making each nook and cranny matter, otherwise, it is essentially a dark, creaky rabbit warren. Luckily, the Sethis’ grandfather actually was an Indian ambassador, stationed across the world, but with a summer party mansion in Dalhousie, formerly part of the historic Punjab, by which this paean to grandness, cocktails and snacking is inspired. This is a restaurant that seemingly wants to lead you astray, with three types of margaritas, one of which you can buy by the 1½-litre bottle for £200. There are shots with names like “Bad Chaat” and “Old Monk Café XO”; a “Patiala Peg” is served tableside with ceremony, along with an accompanying legend about the Maharaja Sir Bhupinder Singh who invented it. Moving away from booze, this is a menu that aims to serve authentic food from undivided Punjab – both India and Pakistan – without Anglifying, Frenchifying or anything else-ifying it. Expect heat, traditional names and matka sauces in darker hues – forget inoffensive, mild, indistinguishable “curries” with sauces in vivid shades. There are matka and karahi – dishes cooked in earthen clay pots and steel woks – featuring rabbit, guinea fowl and lobster. We ate a very good guinea fowl changezi, apparently named after Emperor Genghis Khan; heaven knows how Genghis had any impetus to unite the Mongol tribes after eating this delicious but roaring amount of ghee, cream, green chilli and kasoori methi. Thankfully, my only post-lunch plans were to kick off my shoes and snooze, especially after we polished off the changezi with a large, flaky ajwaini (carom seed) naan. For me, the real fun of this menu, however, was in the opening papads, chaats and “bitings” sections, which feature nine small snacky plates of joy to pick at, scoop through and share. There’s a basket of mutton keema naan with a dipping bowl of rich, bone marrow masala, and an ornate beetroot raj kachori chaat that is a glorious bomb of creamy beetroot, sweet tamarind chutney, black salt, chilli powder and papdi. We ate indoors in the main room, although on this lunchtime in late summer, the outdoor terrace was doing a roaring trade (they have thoughtfully installed screens and greenery to give a sense of privacy and security). The service is dedicated: the staff seem to know the menu and the story behind each dish, as well as being keen to have you back for the DJs, butler-service private rooms and elegant, late-night festivities downstairs, from which this reporter made her excuses and left. Ambassadors Clubhouse is many things: handy, ostensibly fancy but still semi-affordable, open late and easier to get into than Gymkhana, which reportedly has a waiting list of about 1,000 every evening. Go for the cocktails and goat kebab buns with mini fried quail’s eggs, then submit to the rich, Ranjit Shahi prawn curry with a side of surprisingly spicy shakarhand saag (sweet potato and spinach). The prices for some dishes may make you gasp, but the portion sizes are healthy and you are in central London – somebody needs to pay for the fancy hand soaps and artwork in the pretty gothic toilets. I tried to refuse dessert because I had been incapacitated by the BBQ butter chicken chops (and surprised that chickens have chops), but the staff would hear none of it. “Not even a small kesari kulfi falooda?!” This sounded suspiciously like a delicious Punjabi slant on a knickerbocker glory. “OK, if not that, how about just the jalebi [swirls of fried gram flour and sugar syrup] with the merest lashing of dhai rabri [a slant on lassi]?” “No, thank you.” “OK, the mango angoori rasmalai with mango mousse? It’s very refreshing.” Reader, this was a bowl of sweet, plump milky mango dumplings crowned with God-tier whipped mango cream. My disco-dancing days might be over, but after two hours at Ambassadors Clubhouse, my step aerobics days still beckon. Ambassadors Clubhouse 25 Heddon Street, London W1.

That’s Noah’s the fish restaurant, not the builder of the biblical ark, and that’s Spike Island in Bristol, not the Spike Island in Cheshire that was taken over by the Stone Roses back in 1990. It’s important to clear these things up. Spike Island in Bristol is an old harbour area with working boatyards, art spaces, a museum and several pubs. If people tell you that Noah’s is “a funny little place under a flyover”, do believe them. Does anyone, I wonder, visit this place for the first time, see its odd, curved-timber structure hiding where you’d expect only skateboarders to congregate, and not wonder if they are lost? Inside, however, once you’ve climbed up a small set of steps, all uncertainty falls away. This is an elegant space in which to have a proper lunch, with turquoise banquettes, a smattering of maritime decor and a terrace at the back for warmer days. The place has about it a “Captain Birdseye opens a fancy 1980s wine bar with Simon Le Bon” vibe – and in the best possible sense. Noah’s is, essentially, a fish and chip restaurant, a term that has become so sullied over the years that I’ve kept my powder dry, until now. Good fish and chip restaurants in Britain are hard to find these days. We are instead awash with poor fish and chips, or passable fish and chips with poor seating options, or franchised fish and chip chains such as Harry Ramsden’s and Poppies, about which I have little nice to say, so I am now opting to say nothing about them at all. Noah’s is owned by Daniel and Joie Rosser (Daniel’s father Garry runs the Scallop Shell in Bath, a real local favourite). It opened in May last year, and has already been named the UK’s third best chippy at the National Fish &amp; Chip awards. It is that rare breed of chip shop that underpromises and then overdelivers, ostensibly focusing on battered cod or haddock with chips, mushy peas and tartare sauce, but also offering at least a dozen types of spankingly fresh fish and shellfish from Brixham and Newlyn. Expect the likes of Cornish sole with brown butter, parsley and capers; south coast thornback ray wing with romesco and, at the more expensive end of the menu, monkfish tail with mussels for two. You could also spend half an hour here dining relatively cheaply, especially if you stick to the “lock keeper’s lunch” menu, where a small portion of the Atlantic cod or Cornish haddock with chips, peas and a mug of Yorkshire Tea comes in at all of £12.95. Or you could clear the afternoon diary, splash out, order a round of Bristol gin 77s and some fresh sourdough from the city’s lauded Lievito bakery, then work your way through the menu’s “start and share” section, where Portland princess rock oysters sit side by side with hand-dived Orkney scallops, order one of the day’s “market landings”, perhaps with a side of cabbage with pancetta or Isle of Wight tomato salad, before tackling the pudding list. If you came here expecting a chippy with a bit of seating, you’ll be delighted to find a menu with more joie de vivre than your standard megabucks speciality seafood restaurant. Take, for example, a starter of confit tuna belly on sourdough toast, which was a perfect meeting of just blushingly pink fish on some excellent tomato concasse laced with shallots, capers and parsley, and doused in great olive oil. It was a generous portion, too, and beautifully balanced in its vinegary, fishy, crunchy, oily loveliness. My lock keeper’s lunch featured two small, crunchy battered cod fillets, chips, homemade tartare sauce served in a scallop shell, plus a side of perfect sweet, tastefully orange “chip shop” curry sauce. Yes, I did have a mug of Yorkshire Tea with my lunch. Why do more restaurants not offer this? The day’s special was a huge chunk of grilled brill on the bone that came with mussels, chives and brown butter, which Charles ate with Noah’s potato salad. If you ordered the latter expecting that pale, mayo-bound, spring onion-flecked stuff you see in supermarket fridges, this potato salad, dressed with shallots, capers, parsley and moscatel vinegar, will be a revelation. Other menu highlights were world-class Orkney scallops, served nicely browned and with tender flesh in a sea of garlic butter, and huge, grilled wild Atlantic prawns that came with their heads on and whiffing of sea salt and thyme. Do stay for pudding, too, because Noah’s takes it very seriously. The lemon posset with tiny homemade shortbread biscuits was exquisite, while if you wanted something truly sating, go for the rich, lightly whipped chocolate with clotted cream ice-cream. Noah’s is an odd little place down a not-very-pretty road. At face value, it seems to set out its stall mostly as a glorified chippy, but that is the fishiest of claims. It is, in fact, one of the nicest restaurants I’ve come across in years. Noah’s No 1 Brunel Lock Road, Bristol BS1, 0117 452 9240. Open lunch Mon-Sun, noon-3pm, dinner Mon-Sat, 5-9pm.

In fact, it reminds me of nothing so much as a Wednesday goth night at a club called Ritzy’s in 1987; it’s also the oddest place I’ve eaten in all year. Köd arrived in London in 2023, over in Liverpool Street, and marketed itself as serving the very best of Nordic meats and experimental Scandi cooking: lobster with crisp pasta and daikon, cod ceviche with passionfruit vinaigrette, that kind of thing. Over in Soho, however, such blue-sky thinking has been grounded, and there’s a scant choice of rather lazy options, alongside Japanese wagyu, Australian striploin and châteaubriand from South America, all served with chips, chips or chips. In Köd’s defence, menus generally have got simpler in recent years, and multi-paged, fake-leather-bound tomes with 32 choices of entrée feel rather naff these days. My personal bugbear, meanwhile, is the very short à la carte with intentionally opaque dish names that sound like something off the shipping forecast: “Sambucus, Finn, Sticky Cleethorpes.” Obviously, that would be elderflower sap, British vegetarian cheese and the chef’s nickname for his homemade bread. Why would you not know this? Places such as Köd (the name means “meat” in Danish), then, are clearly aiming for and hoping to hit the sweet spot. The menu comes in a leather case and feels all weighty and full of promise, but on scrutiny, it turns out that this is a place for people who would find an Angus Steakhouse wilfully experimental. We start with the “snacks” section, which offers a choice of “a selection of nuts”, “marinated olives” or “crisps and dips”, but provides no further details as to flavours or provenance. Why gild the lily? Starters include raw steak in both carpaccio and tartare form, and steak in tacos. Don’t bother with the latter: these are not lovely, malleable, delicious tacos, but crunchy, ready-made poppadoms filled with beef stodge that explode at first bite. Approach these “tacos” with extreme caution, and wear something wipeable. Other starters include “garlic prawns and Tabasco dip”, “smoked salmon and avocado” and “fresh burrata and rosemary tomato”. I ordered the burrata, convinced that it would feature some kind of flourish or twist, but no: it came on a pile of cherry tomatoes with balsamic vinegar, a combination I last wowed over around the time that Finlay Quaye was collecting his Mobo award back in 1997. In the mains, other than the steaks, which have been flown in from all over the world because clearly steak improves with air miles, there are just five options with snooze-inducing names – “pan-roasted salmon”, “crispy breaded chicken”, “grilled cauliflower steak”, “Köd bacon cheeseburger” and “Köd tartare as a main course” – and they’re all described with such little enthusiasm, it’s as if Köd’s owners are actively trying to put you off ordering them. After all, “crispy chicken” is what Birdseye called fancy poultry in 1978. We ordered a UK côte de Köd to share (500g for £75) with sides of “steak fries à la Köd”, green beans and garlic, and corn ribs. During the lull between courses, the other six diners in the room – from the look of them all Scandi Soho media types (there are also branches of Köd in Aarhus, Oslo, Stavanger and Copenhagen) – held a debrief on the day’s pitches and I tried to get another drink. But nobody seemed to be running the dining room – the service was friendly, but in that sleepy, noncommittal way when they’ll watch you fold a napkin to mend a wonky table leg or finish your water and gasp for more, without quite realising that it’s their actual job. They huddled in groups and hid in cupboards while the service bell clanged yet again to summon them. That said, and importantly, our steak was gorgeous, aged in Himalayan salt and cooked to a perfect medium rare. The corn ribs, however, were caked in a mystery crunchy spice and drowning in miso butter, while the parmesan-coated beans were overcooked and doused in the exact same butter. This is comfort food with little finesse, but that’s not really the kitchen’s fault, because they’re clearly doing the best they can with lacklustre, cheap, ready-made supplies. Fried apple pie sounded like a delightful death row dessert, but was a loveless, possibly bought-in affair, and not even half as good as the scalding thing at McDonald’s. I rarely describe a restaurant as dystopian, but it strikes me that Köd may well be the future of dining out, once the AI robots rule the Earth and we’re down to bugs, dust and 3D-printed gateaux – and I, for one, hail our new pared-down burrata-, nut- and olive-loving overlords.

It was, until recently, Pollen Street Social, but it’s now a case of new name, new menu, softer edges, and more of a come-one come-all, pre-theatre, boozy-treat, long-lunch vibe. Taking a Michelin-starred restaurant and turning it “casual” is always controversial in the foodie world. Not only are you pricking the bubble of those who adore pomp and small portions, but you’re also annoying people who like telling you that they’ve experienced this pomp everywhere from Dundee to Dubai. So when the likes of Atherton suddenly tells staff they can wear jeans, begin serving steaks and doughnuts, and allow the words “Mary’s dirty burger” to enter the fray, pearls will be clutched. Or, more accurately, someone called Douglas in a cummerbund in Cirencester will insist furiously that Mary’s was better in 2012, when his meal took three hours and there were more dishes with translucent, 42-hour consommé and shards of yeast. The paper tablecloths, the soft-serve ice-cream sundaes, the offer of curry mayo on the two-course £29 prix fixe are all daggers to the heart of fancy diners. It’s important, however, to say right now that Mary’s, despite everything above, retains rather a lot of pomp. Atherton has not gone mad, opened a Wimpy and begun serving slop. Quite the opposite: this is a large, elegant, pale room with plenty of light from the vast windows looking down on to Pollen Street. The walls are festooned with modern art, the staff are still drilled to politeness (they’re diligently friendly to solo diners) and, most importantly, chef Alex Parker’s menu is still secretly fancy. Expect Lyonnaise onion agnolotti, Orkney scallops with ajo blanco, rabbit leg with lovage persillade butter, grass-fed tomahawk and Cornish brill with surf clam pil pil. I have not faced down “Mary’s dirty burger”, but closer scrutiny tells me this is good-quality Cumbrian beef stacked with deep-fried pickles and served with Koffmann’s chips and a choice of black garlic aïoli or truffle mayo; you can also eat this burger sitting on a tall stool in the adjacent Blind Pig bar. Eagle-eyed readers might say, “But Atherton’s Blind Pig is a mile away on Poland Street?” Not any longer; the Blind Pig is now part of Mary’s. Over recent months, tracking the Atherton empire’s global transmogrifications requires a large whiteboard and several pens; he’s opened about 40 restaurants over the past 20 years, and now there’s Sael on St James’s Market, the forthcoming Three Darlings in Chelsea, Hot Dogs in Harrods and Row on 5 on Savile Row. Suffice to say, diners who are irked that the former Pollen Street Social is now more user-friendly is the least of Atherton’s worries. Not least because Mary’s is hugely enjoyable: she’s kicked off her shoes and taken the pins out of her barnet. No longer a place to eat daintily, this is now a place to eat rather too much. Expect things with posh names to be battered or breaded – apologies, in tempura or panko crumb – such as top-grade monkfish or a hash of duck breast served in a puddle of rich, silky satay sauce and topped with pickled cucumber. That chunk of tempura monkfish arrives crisp, hot and slathered with warm, freshly made tartare. A side of humble-sounding bobby beans come in a rich tomato fondue with fresh parsley, and there is globe artichoke barigoule for those grasping at health; however, if you’re here on Earth for a good but not a long time, please order the Lincolnshire potato with cabbage, onion and caviar, a soft, heavenly mush of cream, cheese, chive and roe. Or, for that matter, any of the day’s grilled fish – mackerel, john dory and skate on the day I went – which is served with lashings of café de Paris butter. The pudding list is, as you’d imagine, a menace to public health. There was a very good, warm, boozy, cheek-flushing doughnut with calvados-powered custard and plentiful cinnamon sugar, and a Basque cheesecake made with orange, chocolate and tonka bean. There is a chance that by 2028 Atherton might be running all the restaurants and employing all the chefs in the western hemisphere. I would try to be more uppity about this, but I’m still too high as a kite on the calvados doughnut to take the higher ground. Mary’s, 8-10 Pollen Street, London W1, 020-7290 7600. Open Tue-Sat, lunch noon –2.30pm, dinner 5.30-11pm (6.30pm prix fixe). About £60 a head à la carte; set menu two courses for £29, three for £35; all plus drinks and service.

This says much about my fondness for its predecessor, Maison François over in St James’, which has long been near the top of my “dependably fancy” and “classy but not pompous” lists. If Maison François is a grande dame living on an exclusive street and serving oeuf en gelée and côtelette de porc, then Café François is her giddier, multi-floored petite fille, who lives in a permanently hectic tourist thoroughfare and serves crisp frogs’ legs, croque monsieur and three types of eclair. If you’ve experienced British secondary school French lessons without coming across the words “croque monsieur” (AKA a melted cheese and ham sandwich), something has gone awry. Café François’ croque mixture, however, oozes from a hot, fresh flatbread, which also come topped with moules marinière or lamb merguez. As for those frogs’ legs, well, they come battered and deep-fried and served with sauce ravigote, which is essentially tartare sauce with added dijon mustard, though maybe say that quietly, because the French are very precious about their sauces. If you’re currently considering those frogs’ legs and quietly hoping that their “frogginess” is fudged in the presentation, stop now: these legs come in attached pairs, splayed and inviting you to feast upon their bottoms. Café François has taken over one of the largest, most easy-to-find spots on Stoney Street, in a brick behemoth of a building that was once a Paul Smith store. Look for the large, glowing signage and the outdoor eating area on a small terrace, which may not be much fun in October, but was still rammed with diners, many of them wearing hats. Café François is certainly less formal than its mothership; there are no tablecloths and no dessert trolley, unlike over in Piccadilly, although here you will be invited to visit the glass-fronted dessert kiosk where you can lasciviously covet the Paris-Brests and other ornate patisserie. While Maison François is more of an occasion destination, Café François has about it a real rolling, all-day-canteen feel, with added finesse. Start at 7am with pain Suisse and ristretto, then, from 11am, have a bowl of escargots and a gimlet for brunch. At lunch proper and dinner, there are sharing platters of lobster, whole roast chicken or prime rib to eat with something off the international wine list. Café François is not a Café Rouge or a Côte brasserie – the fabulous tiling in the loos tells you that from the off – but it could well turn into Borough Market’s most useful rendezvous point. We began with a round of fat anchovies on brioche, spread with a half-inch-thick smear of herby, pistachio-coloured Café de Paris butter, and a mound of fresh celeriac rémoulade, which may be coleslaw with delusions of grandeur, but I love it nonetheless, especially here, where the earthy, knobbly celeriac meets the bitter joy of a very mustardy rémoulade dressing and a garnish of caperberries. Those frogs’ legs were exactly, if not more than, what one might expect from this rather unlovable dish, and my companion ate three pairs of them while looking like a Roald Dahl-esque baddie as he devoured each succulent thigh. For mains, we tried a huge portion of herby steak tartare, which sadly wasn’t chopped tableside, but was elegant nevertheless. In the vadouvan monkfish, meanwhile, I may well have met a new dining downfall. Why even bother to cook at home when Café François is dishing up such large slabs of well-judged white fish in a thick, deeply flavoured curry sauce, and topping it all off with fat mussels? And good luck slurping those mussels from their shells without showering yourself in orange goo. I failed miserably, and the resultant dry-cleaning bill was all my own fault. As an all-day canteen that caters to the world and its dog from the nearby market, Café François is far better than it really needs to be, but this team are proud and diligent types, and far too good to allow their new place to be rubbish. After no little drooling over and pointing at the cakes, we ordered a gloriously pink slice of raspberry gateau and a glossy, hazelnut cream-filled Paris-Brest to share over pots of earl grey and gossip. This is less a casual cafe than a new London landmark. You go and brave the bedlam of Borough Market, if you like, but I’ll meet you at Café François. I’ll be on the first floor, with my onion soup gratinée and hiding behind a copy of Paris Match. Cafe François 14-16 Stoney Street, London SE1, 020-3988 5770.

Starters £8-£21, mains £17-£32, sharing dishes £105-£140, desserts £10-£13, wines from £45 Before we get on to the “five flavour experience”, the big selling point of this new Brazilian-inspired restaurant, let’s take a moment to accentuate the positive by admiring the lighting design. Because we do need to find something to celebrate here. The lighting really is a model of its kind. A combination of dangling downlights and strategically positioned lamps on the bare wooden tables means there’s enough illumination to see everything without sparking up the smartphone torch. And yet the rest of the room, with its sandstone-coloured walls and undulating grey leather banquettes, like pilates rollers, is held in a moody, intimate glow. I’d urge restaurant designers to go have a look and take notes. Possibly quite quickly. Because the problem with that terrific lighting is it also enables you to see everything that’s about to happen to you in acute detail, and it’s not always pretty. Maroto feels like a restaurant conceived in one long brainstorming session, during which everyone got bored and just settled for ideas, which sounded convincing, so they all could go home, regardless of whether they made the slightest bit of sense or not. It’s next to the Brazilian consulate just north of London’s Oxford Street and occupies the space of what was, for less than year, a restaurant called Bossa, from much-decorated Brazilian chef Alberto Landgraf. The new iteration takes the name of the bar underneath that continued trading after Bossa’s closure. Google translate tells me maroto is the Portuguese for naughty, and that’s certainly a word you could use if you were feeling kind. I am not kind. As well as a few sharing dishes – a whole chicken for £110, a fish for £105 – the heart of the menu is that “five flavour experience”. To quote directly: “Each main dish is accompanied by a unique seasoning representing one of the five flavours. Sweet – Salty – Spicy – Sour – Umami.” This sets off the first alarm bell. “Spicy” is not one of the recognised five flavours. The other one is “bitter”. But I assume that didn’t work with the concept. No worries: at these prices we’ll all end up bitter enough as it is. What you get is a small, plain, well-cooked chicken breast for £19 or three meagre slices of beef for £32, with the same five flavours dotted around both bare, grey plates, like splodges on an artist’s palette. There’s an under-seasoned chilli mayo for the rogue spicy, an acidulated guacamole for sour, soy-marinated mushrooms for umami, a not very salty truffle mayo for salty and what they describe as a “dark marmalade” for sweet. “But don’t have the marmalade with the meat,” the waiter says quickly, after describing the plate. “It doesn’t go with it.” So why are you serving it? He shrugs. “It is just my opinion.” The opinion seemingly being that the whole damn idea doesn’t really work, does it, but what can you do? None of those flavours makes you think, “Wow, this gives me a whole new perspective on chicken breast.” It just makes you think, wouldn’t it have been nice if the kitchen had bothered to choose the right sauce to go with it? This weirdness was preceded by a long wait, given there were only nine of us in there, and before that by some dispiriting starters. One was a splodge of refried beans topped by a room-temperature lump of bronzed pork belly that was half cool white fat. Another was described as a hen egg with cep and truffle. There was no sign of either of those, but there was an astringent foaming pond of what tasted like a parmesan cream surrounding an underboiled egg. When you cut in it leaked not just yolk, but sputum-like undercooked white. Not everything was terrible. Slices of cured sea bass in a bright yellow, citrus-boosted sauce, topped with a pretty flower formed out of ribbons of yellow courgette, was inoffensive. The best dish was a side of rice, mushrooms and beans cooked in a ceramic pot, to which we were invited to add a soy-mirin broth. It was rustic and humble and satisfying. It cost £13. Despite the insistence that this is a Brazilian-inspired restaurant, it felt like the one dish that genuinely engaged with that food culture. I couldn’t help wondering what the staff of the consulate next door make of it all. Dessert was a brown sugar tart that had a nice enough filling but a soggy, damp pastry shell and a truly appalling chocolate mousse that had been piped into a rose, perhaps a while before, because it had set hard. It tasted mostly of fat. As the waiter cleared these dishes, he made the terrible mistake of asking: “Which is your favourite?” This assumes that one of them definitely is, rather than that you think they should both be put in a burlap sack and dropped in the nearest canal to put them out of our misery. Currently, there is a very short wine list with the cheapest bottle, a Verdejo, at £60. The sommelier told me it would soon be longer and that the entry price would drop to a mere £45. Rejoice! Some people question the value of angry, negative reviews like this. I was genuinely intrigued by the five flavour thing. If a kitchen could come up with four main courses, all of which paired brilliantly with five different accompaniments – so 20 permutations – that would be an achievement worth writing about. But if, at the end of a £100-a-head meal like this, I conclude it’s a terrible restaurant and I really can’t recommend that anybody should go there, I need to say so. If I had any doubts about this, it was clinched for me by a trip to one of the gender-neutral loos which, at 9.30pm on a Tuesday night when the restaurant was only a quarter full, housed a sanitary and hand towel bin that was full to overflowing. None of the staff seemed to care, so I’m not sure why I should. I’ll post a picture of it to Instagram, because that’s always an aid to the digestion. Three minutes’ walk away from Maroto on Wigmore Street is a branch of the Lebanese restaurant group Comptoir Libanais, where I happened to grab a quick lunch earlier that day: kofte, salad, rice, some crunchy pickles on the side, and exceedingly good coffee, for £25. Good food. No overwrought concepts. And the bogs are tidy. If you’re in the area and need something to eat, that is one I can recommend. News bites Sam and Georgie Pearman, the couple behind the Double Red Duke pub in Bampton, Oxfordshire, which I liked very much when I reviewed it, have opened a new venture nearby. The Mason’s Arms in Clanfield promises ‘Good Guinness and OK wifi’ which seems a reasonable set of priorities, in the right order. Chef Chris Lindsay, who worked with Pierre Koffmann, has come up with a concise menu. The small plates include a rarebit with damsons, a white onion soup and a prawn cocktail, while for mains there’s the likes of roast chicken with onions and bacon, and baked sole with brown crab butter (masonsarmsinn.com). Chef Michael Caines has announced the closure of his Exmouth seafront businesses Mickeys Beach Bar and Restaurant and the Café Patisserie Glacerie. Both opened in the spring of 2021, but closed on 9 October ahead of a sale to ‘another local business operator who shares a similar passion for fun relaxed dining.’ Caines’s country house hotel, Lympstone Manor, in East Devon, is unaffected by the change. The Burnt Chef Project, a mental health charity for the hospitality industry, has seen a doubling in the number of its online learning modules undertaken in the past 12 months. Mental health awareness training reached over 2,000 students in 55 catering colleges, while its text-based 24/7 support service was utilised by a little over 3,000 people in 2023, up from about 1,000 people the previous year.

It’s an all-day Turkish restaurant in the Hyde hotel next door to the Old Bailey, so it’s handy if you’re a judge or celebrating winning a trial. On the surface, Leydi combines two things that, together, I tend to find ominous: a dining space in a hotel and a chef with reputation and talent. Long experience tells me that these things are not natural bedfellows. Fine food, yes, but also tourists with their pull-along suitcases. Fancy menus, yes, but more often than not served to the jet-lagged, who really wanted only a club sandwich. Worst-case scenario: sometimes, the posh, name-chef hotel restaurants barely even exist at all – Marco Pierre White is rarely spotted behind a vat of meatballs at the Holiday Inn in Blackpool, after all. Happily, in Leydi’s case, however, you’d be forgiven for not realising you’re in a hotel at all. This is a gorgeous, pale, elegant room where boho flourishes and art-deco twinkles mix with pretty tiled floors and large gallery walls. Restaurants should probably not be gendered, but this is a space that is clearly in touch with its feminine side: the walls are a soothing shade of the creamiest, palest pink that’s a bit like a bowl of homemade tarama, while the pendant lighting over each cushioned booth emits light that makes you feel like Greta Garbo on a day off from filming in Istanbul. You might expect Kiazim’s menu writing – always exuberant, authentic, experimental – to have been toned down a bit for a hotel setting, but even her breakfast menu doesn’t pause for breath. There are eggs broken in cultured butter with sucuk sausages, brioche french toast with kaymak and mahlep cherries, and black bergamot-scented Turkish tea in pretty glasses to sip with caramelised tahini pastries. At lunch, meanwhile, there are 12 different complex meze – please, please order the muhamarra – alongside small plates such as lahmacun, dolma and borek, and that’s before you’ve even considered the kebaps from the mangal or the large plates of day-boat fish with coriander ezme. This may sound odd, but what I’ve always adored about Kiazim’s cooking is that it makes me eat with my phone in my hand, checking terms and ingredients. “What is muhamarra?” I wondered when faced with a delicate, glossy, red molehill of thick salsa, or salça, made with sun-dried red peppers and walnuts, all reduced and thickened into a sweet, crunchy flavour bomb. We ordered the “Leydi Deluxe” for two people, which was described as “a showcase of Leydi’s greatest hits” and which, at £50 a head, was exceptional value, especially considering the amount of food involved. First off, a large bowl of fresh, warm potato crisps tossed generously in baharat spices, sumac, garlic, parsley, yoghurt and lemon. Alongside a round of Kavuns off the cocktail menu – or Stoli vodka with yoghurt-clarified raki – these crisps alone would havemade for an elegant lunch. Next, a basket of pide, somun and lavash breads with a mountain of sesame salted butter. “Pace yourself,” I warned Charles with an air of futility, as a bowl of smoked aubergine innards pounded with garlic and mustard turned up, followed by one of atom, or garlic yoghurt doused generously with vivid red urfa chilli oil. That “small plate” lahmacun was a large spiced lamb flatbread with an accompanying hillock of fresh parsley, pickled green chilli and sliced fresh onion to add to the topping for the full effect. Faced with the Leydi Deluxe, my old sadness about being only one woman with one stomach returned with a vengeance, because, yes, there was chicken shish and lamb adana, as one might find in any other Turkish spot in London, but here they came on a raised plinth of fat-soaked pide and marinated peppers, as well as a buttered rice pilau topped with caramelised onions. Dessert advertised itself as “seasonal fruit” – phew! – but turned out to be a properly heaving bowl of fresh figs, sliced sweet peaches, plump dates, kumquats and a huge scoop of lemon sorbet alongside a plate of various biscuits, or kurabiye, you know, just in case you might still be hungry. By this point in the meal, a hotel room within 100 metres of our table would have been very welcome, but Leydi is far from just another tepid hotel dining room. It’s a whirlwind of a restaurant that aims to incapacitate with kindness, an occasion spot to live life large, rather than a “this will do. It’s just downstairs, let’s go down in pyjamas” spot. Although I really don’t think Leydi would mind if you did. Those tourists have never had it so good. Leydi Hyde London City, 6 Holborn Viaduct, London EC1, 020-3530 8100.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(657,'2024-10-25T11:00:42Z','The Devonshire, London W1: ‘The epitome of comfort food’ – restaurant review | Grace Dent on restaurants','An elegant, old-school boozer with a restaurant on a corner just off Piccadilly has garnered such hectic attention over the past 12 months (its anniversary is on Bonfire Night next week) that it’s quite hard to remember that this is just a pub. Yes, just a pub with Guinness, steak and chips, and sticky toffee pudding, rather than a magical, celeb-sprinkled fairy tale kingdom where the likes of Ed Sheeran and Lewis Capaldi have been known to lead the nightly singing session in the back room, while Nigella and Margot Robbie tuck into chocolate mousse upstairs. In a short space of time, the Devonshire has already won several awards, been splashed across a thousand YouTube and TikTok channels, and caused foodies from all over Europe, Japan and North America to wage war over every spare table, which are as rare as hen’s teeth. This is the number one place that friends tap me up for about tips on getting a table. Try midweek, I say, late, late afternoon – and pray that a Beckham or Jon Bon Jovi doesn’t want your spot. But it’s the very fact that the Devonshire is indeed just a pub – albeit one that aims to do everything very well – that is the crux of its ongoing appeal. Landlord Oisín Rogers, Charlie Carroll, founder of the Flat Iron chain, and chef Ashley Palmer-Watts, ex of the Fat Duck and Dinner, are not reinventing the art of hostelry; instead, they’re leaning heavily on a yesteryear type of fun that wraps around punters like a comfort blanket. This is a pub that bakes its own sweet, plump bread rolls with glossy, salty tops and dispenses them around the tables before dinner. It’s a pub with its own butcher, so the lamb cutlets and ribeyes are guaranteed to be of fine quality. It’s a pub with a private room for lock-ins and muso gatherings, where filming on phones is banned, so you can literally have fun here as if no one’s making “content”, a bit as you could in the 1990s. There are boho shades of Soho’s the Colony Room in the modern-art-bedecked walls, while the dark main bar echoes the Coach &amp; Horses on Greek Street; there’s also a touch of the 1980s Groucho Club in the all-round ebullient mood, plus a large scoop of 1970s Kilburn in the often impromptu live Irish music. That said, the main bar is usually so packed with testosterone-fuelled, braying men in gilets, all necking Guinness like there’s no tomorrow, that you may not wish to linger there long, or even at all. For too long, London’s pubs have let down tourists with terrible pints, microwaved “traditional fish and chips” and a general lack of warmth. The world flocks to Soho looking for the British pub experience they’ve seen on TV, but instead what they get is a warm bottle of Rekorderlig blackcurrant in a prime bag-snatching spot off Shaftesbury Avenue, so they retreat to the All Bar One on Leicester Square. At the Devonshire, however, you can pop in for just a Guinness, or head to the grill room upstairs to feast on fat scallops with bacon doused with malt vinegar, or a whopping beef cheek suet pudding with a side of duck-fat chips (the grill itself at the far end of the room will definitely banish any winter chills). The menu is intentionally straightforward: there’s pea and ham soup, white crabmeat salad, lobster, langoustines and ribeye with a choice of sauces. On my last visit on a recent heaving Tuesday lunchtime, I had two of those glossy rolls smeared in salty butter, followed by the prawn and crayfish cocktail, which comes in a sundae glass brimming with marie-rose sauce and bedecked with a fearsome, shell-on crayfish that seems to watch you as you dine. Those big, buttery scallops are some of the best in London, and I’m also a fan of the smoked salmon, though that’s maybe because it’s served with just-baked soda bread. The vegetarian option that day was a seasonal pumpkin risotto, and there was halibut fillet for the pescatarians, but I was with Charles, and he was determined to try the glorious beef chop, cooked medium-rare and sold in portions that began at 600g. It was a day for sides of pommes puree and creamed leeks, which our neighbouring table thought might contain reblochon – this is a convivial kind of place, and people tend to chat. Lunch was the epitome of comfort food: hearty, buttery, and with peppercorn sauces and plates mopped with warm bread. The sticky toffee pudding, by the way, is actually rather refined – delicate and not claggy or overpowering – but the chocolate mousse is its evil little sister: rich, decadent and liable to put you to sleep by 3pm. The Devonshire didn’t invent letting your hair down in Soho – that’s been going on for centuries – but that fine tradition is at least being encouraged, protected and upheld.

Snacks and starters £5– £14.50, mains £26.50-£30.50, desserts £5.50-£10.50, set-price three-course menu £29.50, wines from £30 There’s a cold television-drama rain in Bristol today: the kind of aggressive downpour that special effects teams use for gloomy crime-show night shoots so that it reads on camera, but that never happens in real life. Except it’s happening today, up here in these cream and stucco streets on the edge of Clifton. The sky is the colour of a battleship, the gutters are overflowing and nobody is walking. They are running. Now I am running, too, from a cab to the refuge that is 1 York Place. The picture windows are illuminated by warm orange lamps that act as a beacon against this lunchtime’s early evening light and the dining room is dressed in gentle Scandi shades of oatmeal. There are dried wild grasses attached to the walls, which serve to emphasise just what an escape from the storm this space will be. All good restaurants serve as a refuge; as a redoubt against the tiresome demands of life, work or, as today, the weather. 1 York Place, the latest Bristol restaurant from chef Freddy Bird, does the job beautifully. I first tried his cooking in 2010 at the Bristol Lido, the best-catered swimming pool in Britain. His food there was what you’d treat yourself to after a brisk 50 lengths, or perhaps after watching someone else complete them: wood-roasted fish or lamb, fat ravioli filled with long-braised venison, a fennel and blood orange salad that referenced his years cooking at the Iberian-influenced Moro. A few years ago he opened the Little French in Bristol’s Westbury Park, which delivered on the name’s promise: fish soup, beef fillet with a peppercorn sauce, plus a side of the cheese and potato wonder that is aligot. Now there is this second restaurant, which opened at the end of last year, and which wanders Europe a little more widely. What unites them is a determination to fill the plate to the very edge without recourse to daintiness or understatement. Come hungry. The snacks include potato beignet, served hot. It is a mashed potato and flour batter that has been dropped into the deep-fat fryer until puffed up to a deep golden, leaving a soft, gooey centre. Excavate the avalanche of freshly grated parmesan, flecked with smoked paprika, to find these knobbly doughnuts. Underneath, to reinforce the umami, is a cream flavoured with salted anchovy. Or have their whipped cod’s roe, the central well of which is generously filled with amber jewels of trout roe. Alongside are chopped up radishes for crunch and fire. When the radishes run out, move on to the nutty crust of the sourdough. Those two dishes, costing £14.50, would serve as a classy, brilliantly unbalanced weekday lunch; an indulgence that you might not admit to anyone else. But there are other things demanding our attention. Prime among them is the lunchtime and early evening set-price menu, which is £29.50, including a glass of wine, a Bulgarian Merlot perhaps, or a crisp Spanish white. The successful writing of a set-price menu is a serious skill. It needs to work the margins while not looking as if it’s offering second best. It needs to be tightly written, but still cover most dietaries. There needs to be the whiff of bargain luxury. This one, which costs less than the most expensive main course, does it all brilliantly. From that menu I start with a rustling heap of moon-shaped squash fritters, in a shattering batter dribbled with miel de cana or sugarcane molasses, and dusted with dried oregano. Around and underneath are soft, grainy nuggets of ricotta as a foil to the sweetness. After my lunch I looked back at what I started with at the Bristol Lido all those years ago: discs of battered and deep-fried pumpkin, with honey and oregano and goat’s cheese. I like a cook who cleaves to his own good ideas. The other starter on the set price menu was buttermilk-fried squid with aioli. For my main I chose pieces of pork belly, over the tagliatelle in a lobster sauce, because these are the complicated, troubling choices my life demands now. Pray for me. The crackling crunched. The meat was soft. Underneath was a heap of nutty lentils. Slumped across the side was a sweet-sour quince jelly that would have bellowed autumn if the rain still slapping the windows didn’t already have that covered. For colour there were some vividly purple leaves of what we were told was “heritage” kale, its heritage possibly having something to do with a filthy hook-up with Barney the Dinosaur. It was that purple. This was meat and two veg, after it had learned how to tie a cravat and polish its shoes at Swiss finishing school. It is no criticism of the main menu to say that I really didn’t feel I was getting second best. I just had a smaller choice. The à la carte starters included a thick plank of crunchy-shelled pastilla, made with shredded chicken leg, with a whack of cinnamon, but a light touch on the sweetness. It came with a banging harissa relish to remind you this was a savoury dish. That was followed by two slabs of John Dory, skin crisped and salty, flesh white and lightly bronzed, on a buttery mess of leeks and brown shrimps. If there’s a criticism, it’s that the portion was huge. Less on the plate could have brought down the £30.50 price tag and it might have proved finishable. Then again, that sated appetite may have had something to do with going face-down in the potato beignet and the whipped cod’s roe at the start. To finish, from both menus, there was a house brick of extremely adult tiramisu, the thick layers of sponge sodden with both site-specific Bristol Cream and enough espresso to stimulate a dozy sloth into bouts of calisthenics. Or have the frangipane tart with the deep purple reveal of sliced fresh figs, in a pond of custard and cream, masking shards of sugary crunch. Service was attentive, but then it would be because, shockingly, we were the only diners this lunchtime. It barely needs saying that Bristol is a superb restaurant city, full of independents serving great food without faff or ludicrous ponce. The establishment at 1 York Place sums up that encouragingly bourgeois approach. For a while the rain had abated, but now the director appears to have called action and once more it is sloshing down. It’s as if the weather is telling us to stay put. If only we could. News bites Pasta Brown in London’s Covent Garden has launched a petition to save the business after being told it must vacate the premises it has called home for the past 50 years. The building is owned by a hotel that occupies the rest of the space and now wants the restaurant for a coffee shop, among other things. Pasta Brown, which also provides meals on a weekly basis for the local homeless, says the end of their lease imperils the livelihoods of the multiple families who work there. Read more about the petition here. School Kitchen, which partners with schools to use catering spaces out-of-hours to offer a takeaway service with a share of revenue going to support educational projects, has announced its second outlet. It will operate out of the cricket pavilion at the Latymer Upper School Sports Grounds in London’s Chiswick. Where the original, in a York primary school, was only takeaway, SK Chiswick will also be a restaurant. The menu will feature dishes created by high-profile chefs including Matt Tebbutt’s toad in the hole, Tommy Banks’s hogget meatballs in a cep sauce and Nadiya Hussain’s cardamon rice pudding (schoolkitchen.com). Liverpool restaurant Pilgrim is to reopen after a four-year Hiatus. Restaurateur Jamie Duffield launched the original in 2019 after winning the TV show My Million Pound Menu, but it closed in 2020. Plans to move into a permanent site were put on hold after Duffield was diagnosed with a cancer from which he has now fully recovered. The new version will be in the city’s Allerton district and will feature an open kitchen, 24 seats and a changing menu of seasonal Spanish dishes.

Pimlico is modern life with all its tricky edges smoothed off. Wildflowers, a new restaurant by chef Aaron Potter and interiors stylist Laura Hart, is Mediterranean-inspired both in menu and decor. Potter was once head chef of Elystan Street, one of the capital’s loveliest places to have dinner. Here, he’s dishing up the likes of lamb tartare with harissa, scallop crudo and sugar pit pork chop with gremolata. It’s a three-course-dinner affair: there’s no painfully long tasting menu and a heavenly absence of tweezers. The menu is hearty, but thoughtful and fancy – but not painfully fancy. Wildflowers is, damn it, verging on casual, but it’s Pimlico casual, so, yes, denim and trainers, if you like, but this is no Bella Italia. The first challenge at Wildflowers is to make it through the “retail opportunity” of Newson’s Yard without being seduced by shops selling bespoke kitchen appliances and 20th-century Nordic furniture. This former timber yard has been dreamily repurposed as a magnet for interior designers and the artsy local community. In any other postcode, it would simply have been bulldozered, but because this is Pimlico, architects have lovingly restored its skeleton and created a double-height courtyard with a glass ceiling that allows light to flood over Wildflowers’ mezzanine cocktail bar, and make the indoors feel oddly outdoors. The second challenge at Wildflowers is to order a round of their chunky, glossy gnocco fritto filled with gorgonzola, topped with speck and drizzled with honey, then eat it in one bite so it doesn’t dissolve before it’s all in your mouth. These delights are £4.50 each, but then, this is Belgravia, where even breathing is expensive. Wildflowers, like most things in the area, is so charming and tasteful that finding fault is a challenge: you sit in a room of marble, velvet, oak and terracotta, eating complimentary warm focaccia while waiting for a generous plate of prosciutto San Daniele served with feisty pickled peaches. Scallop crudo lies in a slick of fennel pollen, nashi pear and almonds. One of the shining lights of the menu is the fat, blackened mackerel, which looks almost cartoonish on chunks of sardine-smeared bruschetta. The whole thing is powerfully, decadently fishy. The lamb tartare, meanwhile, might seem to some a rather odd concept, raw lamb not being all that common a sight on British menus, but it’s definitely worth a go: it is a delicate dish with soothing labneh and a lightly spiced harissa. Main courses are generous; Wildflowers is very much a place to take guests who quibble at style over calorific substance. The duck cooked over coals and served in sherry jus with soft golden raisins is a large portion. When my grilled sea bass arrived – a hulking chunk topped with puttanesca butter and on a bed of beans – I suddenly remembered how many Lilliputian dinners I had eaten recently. Was this meant to be fish for two? Alongside came a side of “holiday potatoes”, a take on rosemary-encrusted roasties dipped in puttanesca sauce. No amount of quizzing the servers could glean any more info on the name – was Potter on holiday when he came up with the idea, maybe? Whatever, I needed a holiday after finishing them. This was the sort of lunch when even my tights felt tighter afterwards. And I’d not even tried the cuttlefish fideuà. We shared a lemon tart, artfully blackened on top, with brittle pastry and sharp, zinging innards. Just like Belgravia, it was sweet, refined and so beautiful that it made me feel shabby and unkempt in its presence. I told a friend about Wildflowers afterwards – about the shops, the cocktail bar and the lovely fish – and asked if they’d ever go. “Belgravia?” they replied. “Pgh. Not bloody likely: full of snobs, it’s like another planet.” I doubt the residents will lose much sleep about that.

All dishes £4-£10, wines from £18, all cocktails £10 A few weeks ago, I wrote one long, wretched primal scream about the terrible insult to the words “hot dog” that I had to eat at Harrods in your service. If you were worried about me after that, and I understand you might have been, you can now relax. For here I am at Mauby, a new Caribbean restaurant in Brockley, southeast London, and the first plate before us is a single, fat smoked sausage with exactly the right crisp-skinned snap and the correct smooth, juicy interior that I had hoped for. With it are pickles and a yellow Bajan pepper sauce full of heat and vinegar and vigour. It was everything I hoped it would be. This one dish sent all the bad memories packing. There are many ways to get to Mauby, not least by foot if you are lucky enough to live within a smoke and allspice-sniff of the place. I took the overground from Highbury &amp; Islington, a train route which in February was renamed the Windrush Line by Transport for London. The new title has not been entirely without controversy. Some saw it as a mere gesture. There are, they say, still too many people who arrived in the UK from the Caribbean from the 40s onwards, who suffered as part of the Windrush scandal for which Theresa May apologised, and who are still awaiting justice, be it for wrongful imprisonment, deportation or infringement of legal rights. It’s a fair point. But the renaming has also been taken by many as a tribute to the contribution made by people from the islands to the capital, as it trundles through Afro-Caribbean communities from Dalston in the north of London to Peckham in the southeast. It makes it an appropriate way to arrive at this wine bar and bistro celebrating the food of Jamaica and Barbados. Given the power of cocktails often made with an awful lot of rum, it helps that it’s merely a three-minute stagger from restaurant door to platform. My first drink is a cocktail made with the sweet sharpness of sorrel and lime, lending a briskness to a good measure of that Jamaican Wray &amp; Nephew rum. The evening has begun. Mauby, which is the name of a Caribbean drink made from tree bark, belongs to Daniel Maynard, who has both Barbadian and Jamaican heritage, and his partner Heleena. It began life as a mildly restless project called Jerk Off BBQ. It is tempting to suggest with a knowing wink, that you should be careful before looking that up online, but I got to the 15th page of a Google search without finding anything not related to smoke, sauce or dry rubs of an entirely innocent kind. For a few years they worked out of a unit in Deptford and ran a street-food operation, building a fanbase, before crowdfunding to convert this old chippy. You can see where the money hasn’t gone. It is a simple, warm, bare-bones space. There’s a paprika-coloured frontage framing half net-curtained windows. There’s a nailed-together wooden bar upon which sits a bowl heaped with oranges. There are rough-textured walls, wooden tables and, as evening falls, the gutter of a few candles. It is a conscious reframing of the food of the islands. I live in Brixton and have long been a fan of the neighbourhood’s takeaways: simple places like Brompton Jerk Kitchen which operates most Saturdays in the alley out the back of a café opposite Brockwell Park, serving crusty slabs of crackled jerk pork fresh off the drum BBQ, or the cult Maureen’s Kitchen round the corner from me on Railton Road, who literally cooks in her domestic kitchen, and delivers her food in boxes of pure cardboard. Through familiarity and repetition, we assume that’s how it must always be with this food, but the Maynards are rightly determined to show there are other ways; that it cannot and should not be overlooked. Mauby offers a short, impressively cheap menu of small plates, plus a few well-chosen wines and cocktails. Alongside the £8 sausage of my dreams, there’s a £6 bowl of their beans stewed “homestyle” in a thumping gravy. If that’s the style of their home, I want to move in. It’s the sort of comfort food that would make any bad day better. From the lighter and brighter side of the ledger there is a Bajan cucumber salad, sparky with Scotch bonnet, fragrant with chopped green herbs, sprightly with vinegar. Or have the heritage tomato salad, a platter of well-dressed discs in yellow, red and purple, topped with a couple of fat, meaty sardines, silver-skinned, brown-fleshed and deeply flavoured. A bowl of crispy new potatoes with garlic mayo is a cheery accompaniment, although it feels like an interloper from a different small plates restaurant. The most expensive dish tonight costs a mighty £10. It is a heavily sauced jerk chicken thigh and drumstick, with a properly crunchy blackened skin, and a big old hit of pimento and mace. It’s easy to assume this would always be part of the repertoire. Not so. A new menu was introduced just a week or so after I ate there, and jerk chicken isn’t on it. That new menu includes charred pumpkin with Bajan tamarind sauce, crispy okra with pepper mayo, home-style stewed pork – that home really is sounding inviting – fried sprats with lemon and braised butter beans. The message is this: you should park your assumptions about what must be available at such a place. Having given one list of dishes a complete shake down, I’d happily do the same with the other. The only constant amid the savouries is the carbohydrate ballast of plantain, served in a bronzed, fried heap. I confess plantain has never done it for me. It’s an acquired taste that I have never quite acquired. I accept that I may be the one missing out here. Dessert is handled by a plate of rum-sodden chocolate truffles, which are so soft they’re almost a dark ganache being held together only by a thick cocoa dusting and politeness. This is not a complaint. On an early Friday evening, Mauby has exactly the vibe you want of it: relaxed, mellow and bubbling with end-of-week chatter. It feels like a new business that has worked out what it needs to be from the very start. On the short walk back to the station I come across a chap tending to a smoky barbecue beneath a street corner tree. He’s offering more jerk chicken to the Friday night crowd. I conclude I rather like Brockley. News bites After 14 years, James Robb and Alan Kilpatrick, the impeccably tasteful duo behind the East Pier Smokehouse in St Monan’s, Fife, are calling it a day. But they are determined that the much-loved seasonal restaurant, famed for serving lobster and chips and seafood curries in cardboard containers, should not just become another fish and chip shop. In short, they are looking for successors. As Robb says, ‘A busy restaurant needs fit, young creative people with a passion for food and hard work. We have plenty of passion, but youth and fitness are slipping away. It’s torch passing time.’ If running a bare-bones seafood restaurant on the Scottish east coast is calling to you, you’re invited to email them for more information (info@eastpier.co.uk). The staff of Gloria Trattoria, part of the Big Mamma Group, are staging a dinner to raise funds to help save Casa Italiana, the social club which has served London’s Italian community in Clerkenwell since 1960 and which is now under threat from rising costs and falling membership. Tickets for the four-course dinner, which is taking place at the club on 14 November, cost £60. Find details of the menu and buy tickets here.

This single room with a minuscule kitchen attached is upstairs at the Oarsman pub in the centre of Tom Kerridge’s fiefdom, so there’s bound to be some decent hungry passing trade, and most chefs who take over a space in a pub, hotel or fancy department store become troublesome lodgers within about three weeks. More fool you if you let a cook into your property to create their “culinary vision”: within hours, your lifts will be full of lobsters and a consommé spillage will have blown your electrics. It is rather raffish of chef Simon Bonwick, then, to be quite so upfront, yet the Oarsman has given him this austere, very snug and dimly lit private dining room with one vast, leather-topped, antique conference table of the kind you’d imagine the bankers in It’s A Wonderful Life crouching over. Apparently, the room had been unused and full of dusty boxes and bags of sand until the new lodger took it on and turned it into what is essentially a reflection of his inner mind. Bonwick loves to paint, you see – his penchant being semi-surreal, multi-coloured dreamscapes – and every wall is now covered floor-to-ceiling with exhibits of his work, along with a pencil drawing of Tupac Shakur by one of his nine children; one of the space’s deep windowsills is filled with Bonwick family photos. The daily set menu – there are five courses at lunch, plus petits fours – is ornately handwritten on a single sheet of A4, and features dishes called the likes of “sea scallop like Mitsuhiro Araki showed me” and beef with “rather nice beef sauce”. And when you’re eating these highly personal dishes, Bonwick himself is all of 10 feet away, cooking in a kitchen that’s smaller than the pantry in my late grandmother’s two-up-two-down. If that all sounds a bit intense and unusual, then you’d be correct in thinking so: the Troublesome Lodger is the antithesis of the big, corporate, multi-seater for which an expensive design agency has vision-boarded the theme and a huge HR team has been employed to recruit the crew. On this Friday lunchtime, the only front-of-house was the chef’s daughter, and the other four diners were two foodie types who had followed Bonwick from his former Michelin-starred home at The Crown near Maidenhead, and a couple who live just down the road and who usually eat downstairs in the Oarsman itself. I can tell you these facts for certain, because we all ate together, down one end of that vast table, as if we were at an underpopulated wedding. If communal dining with strangers frightens you, abandon all plans to head to the Troublesome Lodger immediately; otherwise, bring your dinner party chat A-game and settle in. Proceedings began with warm bread rolls and Bonwick’s “top butter” (unsalted, sadly) to accompany “my gravlax of salmon” featuring cured, dill mulch-strewn salmon on a mustardy sauce. Next up was that intriguing, Araki-influenced raw scallop on some weird lentil mush, followed by “the Lodger’s crab dish” of good-quality shellfish in a refined mayo, enlivened by raw apple soaked in vibrant yuzu and arranged in a neat little pile with two teensy potatoes at its base, like baby feet. The main course was probably the best: poached Highland rump à la ficelle (tied with string) with a rich reduction, beets, carrot, a tiny quenelle of mashed potato, an elaborately curled spinach leaf shaped into a ball and a single – and stone cold – button mushroom. It reminded me of a posh, albeit small Sunday lunch with a world-class gravy that was rather more than “rather nice”. Bonwick’s style is British flavours with French techniques and Japanese influences, and although you might find more adventurous menus even just up the road, there is something heartwarming about the Troublesome Lodger, where strangers pitch in and share their lives over a meal. We talked about our families, the expense of storage spaces, the state of the traffic on the M40 and the dramatic ouevre of Dame Margaret Rutherford. The conversation ranged through our starters and main, continued past dessert – a classic French tarte bourdaloue with a lovely, flaky crust, almond cream and poached pears that came with clotted cream and custard, which Bonwick himself scooped out of a pan and on to our plates – and carried on right through to coffees and chocolate truffles, before we were ushered down a curious back staircase that thrust us out into the main street. Yes, the Troublesome Lodger is a bizarre way to spend three hours, but do try to give it a go before the eviction.

Wraps from £9; mezze £8.50 – £16; main courses £16.25 – £26.50; desserts £8.50. Wines from £26 a bottle In one corner of the lengthy menu at Joseph’s Brasserie, a lovely new Lebanese restaurant in London’s Kensington, is a description which may give some people pause. It’s listed under Signature Dishes and begins “Tender lamb intestines stuffed with a savoury mixture of rice…” The sweet word “tender”, used for kisses and caresses, has to do an awful lot of heavy lifting there, when it’s shepherding the word “intestines” into view. It’s just too duodenal, isn’t it? Too redolent of lunch on the way out of the body as waste, rather than on the way in as pleasure. Ah, the curse of nouns. Of course, if you look up a picture of fweregh, the Lebanese name for the dish, what you get is a pleasingly gnarly sausage; a sibling to the haggis and a cousin to bangers the world over. You did know that’s what sausages are made of, didn’t you? Good. We didn’t order it, as it happens: the fweregh weighs half a kilo, costs £80, was not suitable for everyone at our table and would have dominated lunch. But it says something about the place: that if you know where to look or, better still, ask for guidance from the eponymous Joseph, you may well find a few Lebanese dishes cooked here by his father, Yazbek, that you haven’t before encountered. Other things, however, are familiar. Very familiar. At least to me. Only as I was striding down Kensington High Street did I clock that Joseph occupies the same location as Pascor, a Middle Eastern-themed restaurant I reviewed just over 18 months ago, but which obviously has gone the way of too many other hospitality businesses. This, I realise, hands a loaded gun to those who complain about the geographic spread of these columns. He doesn’t just review occasionally in the same London tube zone; sometimes he reviews in the same bloody square footage. On the one hand, guilty as charged; on the other, if I’d been put off by that, we’d all have missed out – or at least I would have. Downstairs little has changed, save that fat spits of lamb and chicken shawarma now turn slowly behind the counter for their sandwich business. There are fryers for falafel and a grill for lamb kofta, skewers and the like. Smoke pirouettes upwards and the air smells like a narrow Middle Eastern street after dark, even in daylight. All of this is served with the flatbreads made from scratch, which are soft and pillowy on one side, and crisp and friable on the other. The upstairs dining room has, however, had a makeover. Now there are turquoise walls with gold edging, and hung on the walls are antique etchings, picked up in Portobello Market. On one side there are Victorian views of London, on the other equally venerable images of Lebanon, of grand ancient vistas and cypress trees punching the sky like insistent exclamation marks. I could perhaps have added the words “in happier times” to that description of Lebanon, but the tragic carnage and political chaos unfolding there is so obvious, it barely needs referencing in a restaurant review. For now, let’s celebrate the food culture. The menu is long and detailed and covers the usual. There are three takes on hummus, including hummus Beiruti, spiky with free chilli. There are stuffed vine leaves, platters of labneh and the whacking chilli and red pepper fire of muhammara. There are kibbeh and cheese rolls. We have a deep, verdant bowl of tabbouleh to bring greenery to the table and another of moutabal, the soothing bash of roasted aubergine, which is the best kind of beige. In the middle is a well filled with grassy olive oil in which sparkle beads of pomegranate. It demands a sweeping through with torn wedges of the still hot bread. To the familiar we add the unfamiliar, soft folds of sliced lamb’s tongue, sautéed in lemon and garlic, a self-saucing dish which demands more bread. There are small, coarsely ground lamb sausages made on site with an edge of offal and a hit of chilli, and which come in a liquor that is sweet and sharp with pomegranate molasses. Now we have an extra use for the mdardara, a nutty mix of rice and lentils, threaded with sweet, caramelised onions like toffee. A mixed grill of lamb kofta and both lamb and chicken shish is solid enough, but it is completely overshadowed by another signature dish listed as Sultan Ibrahim. It brings four floured and seasoned red mullet, deep-fried until golden, so that the flesh pulls away from the bone. We find ourselves using our fingers to pick at the good stuff right up to the top of the head. Through the crust there are flashes of silver skin and they lie on a rustling mound of shredded flatbread that has also been deep-fried, then dusted with the purple of sumac. On the side is a bowl of sticky tahini sauce. It’s the kind of dish you fantasise about eating at some restaurant on a corniche at the eastern end of the Med, with the smell of salt and seaweed in your nostrils, as a blisteringly hot day gives way to the close, sagging warmth of an evening by the sea. It’s not cheap at £40, but consider the sheer volume of fish. Also, I will from now on be furiously shredding and deep-frying flatbreads. We finish with their knefe, a wedge of sweet and salty melted cheese spreading gently across the plate and topped by a lozenge of syrup-soaked pastry, fragrant with rose and pistachio. Alongside is a bowl of a set milk pudding, dressed with orange blossom and rose water. Finally, we have thimbles of thick, dark coffee, heavy with black cardamom. We are alone in the dining room this lunchtime which, as ever, seems completely wrong. No, Joseph’s is not cheap. You may find cheaper Lebanese food amid the community clustered around the Edgware Road, but it is not outrageous for Kensington High Street, and you can get a shawarma wrap here for £9. As we are leaving Joseph asks us sweetly if we will leave a positive review on Google. In the sense that this will indeed turn up somewhere on Google, I like to think that I’ve done as he asked. News bites StreetSmart, the charity that tackles homelessness, has launched its annual campaign to raise funds in the run-up to Christmas through an extra £1 added to restaurant bills. More than 600 restaurants and pubs are participating this year, including veterans of the campaign like St John and the River Café, alongside Mana in Manchester, Box E in Bristol, Upstairs by Tom Shepherd in Lichfield and Ynyshir in Wales.

Ikea has opened its first standalone restaurant, in London’s Hammersmith. The 75-seat café, which occupies the site of a what was a branch of Wasabi, is next door to the newly renovated Ikea Hammersmith City Store, and will also be open for breakfast. Chef Claude Bosi and his wife, Lucy, are opening a second Josephine Bouchon, the bistro celebrating the food of Bosi’s native Lyon, which opened to such acclaim in London’s Fulham earlier this year.

Or at least that’s what I gather – to the British ear, the name just sounds archly gothic. And that’s quite in keeping with this capacious, glamorous and sparsely lit joint, where the music is loud (tribal house, or thereabouts, in case you’re wondering) and a statuesque beauty in a tailored leather gown walks you from the front curtain to your table, before handing you over to a server. Well, make that servers plural, because they are legion here. This place is a collaboration between chef Chris Denney, formerly of Fiend and 108 Garage, and George Bukhov-Weinstein and Ilya Demichev, the pair who in 2014 caused chaos on the London dining scene when they opened Beast, a similarly Bram Stoker-ish spot in a crypt that served only gigantic king crab, steak and chunks of aged parmesan with rocket. Prices started at about £100 a head, which at the time felt like a lot for surf, turf and some cheese with the devil’s lettuce. Little did we know back then that £100 would be roughly the bill for a minor blowout at Pret nowadays. Fantômas’ prices are wholly in keeping with fancy London norms right now, so factor for about £100-plus a head, before booze and service. I drank a glass of fancy lemonade with a cryptic name for £14 purely to show willing. One thing is for certain here, though: Denney is again reaping his trademark culinary whirlwind. He’s never boring and his menu is delicious but borderline chaotic on a global level. There are sweetbreads with sauerkraut, celeriac with lamb heart ragu, beetroot with buttermilk ranch sauce and Irish beef with a suet dumpling. This is King’s Road in Chelsea, and Denney’s menu screams: “Europe by private jet, stopping briefly in most capital cities, but avoiding anything as gauche as passport control.” Should Japan feel left out, there’s dashi soup and chutoro tuna with ponzu. You want Mexico? Here’s rare squab pigeon (how very home counties) on a Mexican red mole sauce. Denney can undoubtedly cook incredibly well, and his kitchen team show flair for flavour in everything they touch, be it the rich, lightly whipped chicken liver parfait with a doorstop of warm sourdough focaccia or, one of my favourite dishes of the night, a simple slab of hispi cabbage elevated by being sweetly caramelised and served with tarama. That squab, incidentally, is served so rare, it could feasibly have been annoying the tourists at Nelson’s Column not 10 minutes earlier, but the mole sauce it comes with is wholly drinkable. I liked the barbecued aubergine with hibachi oil much less, because it had turned soggy during its titivation. That said, the hits at Fantômas far outweigh the misses, and the perilla-scented ponzu sauce with that chutoro is altogether outstanding. Even so, Fantômas is a wholly unrelaxing dining experience. There’s an open kitchen on one side of the room and a cocktail bar on the other, the music is relentless and every course seems to be delivered by a different server, which leads to oversights. There are about 80 covers and – on the Saturday I visited, at least – almost as many servers, sommeliers, managers, deputy managers and even the owners, all milling about on the floor and barely two yards from your plate. I’ve seen calmer hokey cokeys. There’s no point trying to hide in the toilets for solace, either, because they are styled like caves, plus the ladies’ has stone walls, so feels a bit like being held at Carlisle Castle for sedition. This is a restaurant that left me with many more questions than answers. By dessert, another fresh face appeared tableside and implored us to try the cucumber ice-cream, which turned out to be a painfully cold cucumber granita fuming with liquid nitrogen. Solace, however, was found in Denney’s trademark rum savarin, here served with chantilly cream and pineapple: think a small, delicate baba with a twist of piña colada. Our other dessert was a “chocolate bar”, a concoction of mousse, orange and hazelnut with a jerusalem artichoke ice-cream that was oddly warm. We are definitely in “jerusalem artichoke dessert season” now, people, a yearly event in the fancy food calendar – I will certainly not forget last year’s artichoke tarte tatin in a hurry. Fantômas shook me up and threw me back out into the street, £200 poorer and having to push my way past that leather-gowned hostess and one of the owners, who were debating VIP tables, plus it took until Sloane Square tube for my tinnitus to start clearing up. All in all, it was an unforgettable evening. Fantômas 300 Kings Road, London SW3, 020-8191 2781. Open dinner only, Tues-Sat, 6-10pm (last orders; 10.30pm Fri &amp; Sat).

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(667,'2024-11-17T06:00:03Z','The Yellow Bittern, London: ‘Leaves you muttering about school dinners’ – restaurant review','The Yellow Bittern, 20 Caledonian Road, London N1 9DU (020 3342 2162). Starters £7 – £8; mains £20 – £28; desserts £8 – £9. Wines from £40 Chefs gather in tribes. There are the tweezer chefs and the dude food chefs and the live-fire chefs, wisps of smoke forever rising from their singed eyebrows. Then there are the chef poets. They cleave to texts by Richard Olney and Elizabeth David, like mothers to their newborns. They perv over ingredients. They work backwards from the experience at the table into the kitchen, rather than from the kitchen outwards. And they adore a well-turned phrase. They are romantics. Belfast-born Hugh Corcoran is very much a chef poet; one who has even published his own volume of writing. He often keeps his trousers up with braces, wears metal-rimmed spectacles and has about him the mien of a 1930s small-town butcher who has a lovely piece of gammon put aside for you. He has cooked in the Basque country and Paris as well as at pop-ups in London, where his pared-down dishes have won him a following. Now comes the Yellow Bittern, which is less a restaurant than a declaration of intent via the medium of lunch. It opens only on weekdays for two sittings, at noon and 2pm, and not at all for dinner. Bookings can only be made by phone or “postcard” and they accept only cash. There is no printed wine list because “it is all in Hugh’s head”, but the offering is entirely natural and runs from £40 a bottle (and £10 a glass) to £300. The Yellow Bittern, named after an 18th-century Gaelic poem about a bird who couldn’t crack the ice with his beak to get a drink, occupies the King’s Cross home of Luncheon, a biannual cultural magazine edited by Lady Frances von Hofmannsthal. Accordingly, there is a bookshop on-site which occupies an institutional space in the basement that looks like the library of a TB sanatorium circa 1936. Here are works by Seamus Heaney and Samuel Beckett just as, upstairs, in the sparse, yellow-walled dining room, which seats only 18, there hangs a photograph of Brendan Behan, alongside a portrait of Lenin. This, according to one of Corcoran’s Instagram posts, is a prized possession that goes everywhere with him, for he is a lifelong communist, devoted to many causes, including anti-colonialism in general and a United Ireland in particular. A recent Corcoran Instagram post celebrating the founder of the Soviet Union as the “liberator of the slaves” was met with comments detailing Vladimir Ilyich’s complicity in the murderous Red Terror and the founding of the gulags, among other things. How you engage with his politics, which might stick in the throat of some, is entirely up to you. You can just go for lunch, as Fergus and Margot Henderson, the chef poets-in-chief, have already done, along with many other chefs from across London. The day we are there, for example, another table is occupied by a party of cooks from Noma in Copenhagen. The Yellow Bittern had been open for just six working days and was already a point of pilgrimage. The tiny dining room with its paper-clothed tables has a small open kitchen boasting a single oven and an induction ring. Laid out across the bar when we arrive, alongside a barrel of warm ale, are many baked goods: bricks of cloud-grey soda bread, neatly tucked guinea fowl pies for £40 to be shared between two, and a huge glossy, quilted disc of apple pie for dessert. The limited menu is scribbled up on a blackboard and its best is delightful. That nutty soda bread is served with generous wedges of yellow butter that can be spread so thickly you can set your teeth marks into it. The butter is unsalted, but there’s a dish of the white stuff on the table so you can add your own hypertension. Among the platters on the bar were shiny leaves of simmered leek, which we are told by Lady Frances in a whisper, were pulled from her country garden “only yesterday”. They arrive topped with a nose-twitching grain mustard vinaigrette, chopped boiled eggs and fresh green herbs, a version of the recipe in Simon Hopkinson and Lindsay Bareham’s Roast Chicken and Other Stories. While I am enjoying that, I see Corcoran heave from the oven a joint of crackling-bodiced pork; a fabulous piece of meat, sensitively cooked, which is sliced thickly and plonked on top of a heap of white beans for £28. At the end comes a wedge of that apple pie, which has that all-important third interface layer where the sweet stewed apple has merged with the pastry’s inner thigh to create a grand sugar, fruit and butter softness. We have cheeses, too, including St Tola goat’s and a blue called Young Buck, which softens the funking glass of natural red my companion orders. This lunch makes the point about simplicity’s virtues well. But there’s another lunch here, in which the whole performative nature of it leaves you muttering about having been served school dinners, only at Hackney natural wine bar prices. A dreary leek and potato soup, thick as wallpaper paste for £7, is served tepid. For the main there’s a bowl of sausages and potatoes in broth listed as Dublin Coddle, a mellifluous name that cannot disguise the fact it’s two bought-in Cumberland sausages, some potatoes and broth for £20. The sludgy baked rice pudding is served cold. In its oval dish on the bar, it looked rather cheering; on the plate it looks like something your elderly cat might have coughed up. There is a fine line between celebrating simplicity and just not putting your back into it. Impressively, the Yellow Bittern walked both sides of that line across one lunch. A few days later, Corcoran complained on Instagram that diners weren’t ordering enough. “Restaurants are not public benches,” he moaned. “You are there to spend some money.” Perhaps open for dinner then, when people are happier to drink. The comic thing about the whole venture is that it sells itself as cool and radical. This is a restaurant by an arty set, who publish a cultural magazine and have scythed away at the fripperies of the 21st century, such as credit card payments and a website. In effect, though, it plays as the small-c conservatism of John Major’s wistful speech about a fantasy England of “warm beer, invincible green suburbs, dog lovers and – as George Orwell said – old maids bicycling to Holy Communion through the morning mist”. That reference will doubtless drive an old communist like Hugh Corcoran absolutely nuts. It doesn’t make it any less appropriate. News bites Following the recent news that gift vouchers worth thousands of pounds will not be honoured following the closure of Birmingham restaurant Purnell’s, because it’s now in receivership, comes a rather bigger voucher story from the US. TGI Fridays there has declared bankruptcy. According to the hospitality industry newsletter Propel, there’s a risk that franchisees will be left responsible for outstanding vouchers, the $50m value of which far exceeds available cash reserves. Lawyers for the company have, however, said, they intend to honour their obligations. Meanwhile in Leeds, the company behind chef Michael O’Hare’s restaurant Man Behind the Curtain, which more recently traded as Psycho Sandbar, has been wound up with debts close to £1m. In Lyme Regis, it’s farewell to chef Mark Hix’s Oyster and Fish House, after 16 years of trading. The last service will be on 7 December, after which the restaurant will be under new ownership. Hix says he has no plans to open any new restaurants, but that he’s working on various projects and will continue to run his Kitchen Table events from his Charmouth home. Great British Menu winner Kirk Haworth and his partner Keeley, have announced the launch next spring of a French farm and retreat, to go alongside their plant-based restaurant Plates, which opened in Shoreditch in July to enormous demand for tables. The new venture, in the Lot-et-Garonne, will have seven bedrooms, alongside a gym and sauna. Four-night packages start from £1,000 per person.

That’s a question many were pondering outside Noodle Inn on Old Compton Street in Soho. Hand-pulled, oil- and chilli-drenched Xi’an biang biang noodles are the draw at this viral internet sensation, invariably involving a lengthy wait near the corner of Charing Cross Road. The place opens at midday on the dot, but the queue starts forming at about 11.25am – yes, even on a drab, cold Monday. By 11.40am, it stretches as far as Disney’s Aladdin at the Prince Edward theatre 100 yards up the road, and is divided in two, one half of which curls around the window displays of the Harmony sex shop. “Are we really going to queue for this long?” I overheard several people say as their companion stared glassy-eyed at this no-frills, 80-seater canteen. It doesn’t matter that Noodle Inn’s mothership, Kung Fu Noodle, which specialises in the cooking of Gansu Province, is but a short hop away on the edge of Chinatown or, for that matter, that there are wonderful biang biang noodles to be had at Master Wei Xi’an in Fitzrovia and a dozen or so other places in town. That’s not the point: queueing begets queueing, and it’s a pastime that food fans now share at an international level. As a critic, I’m far from immune, either. I once waited hours to get into the UK’s first outpost of Din Tai Fung, for what were on reflection perfectly fine, but not life-altering xiao long bao. In fact, I’ve probably squandered days of my life on posh cookies and fancy burgers. To ruin that Kate Moss adage: “Nothing tastes as good as eating a viral sensation feels.” To be fair, the Noodle Inn queue moves pretty quickly – not least because, like all foodie internet smash hits, the place has to be run like a military operation rather than a restaurant. Queue, order, pay, get out. Within a millisecond, your seat will then be taken by another bank card-waving experience collector. Noodle Inn’s menu is brief and, as you might have worked out already, noodle-focused. The chilli oil spill noodles are where I’d advise you to linger, be it the braised beef brisket, chicken or minced pork options, or the scrambled egg with tomato. They come doused in a rich, knockout glut of fiery joy, as well as with crunchy sprouts and enough minced garlic to stun Nosferatu, all piled on top of those noodles, which are wide, plentiful, fresh and sating. The toppings are generous and there’s a largesse, an almost too-muchness here that’s missing from other such London joints. But are they the best in town? It’s hard to say, because all biang biang, special wide-cut and stirred knife-cut noodles are pretty good – even the lacklustre ones. Width-wise, Noodle Inn’s biang biang teeter on the edge of lasagne, but that thick, smooth surface provides plenty of cling room for generous quantities of garlic, Sichuan pepper, cumin, coriander and delicious oil. After all, anything flat is more delicious in the mouth, and biang biang are the Pringles of the noodle world. The beef brisket arrives begging to be photographed, with a rib of gelatinous meat on top, although it was certainly not fall-off-the-bone tender enough. The braised chicken, on the other hand, was a dream. I think of it often, sitting there paddling in an inch of spicy oil. But for God’s sake, don’t wear white and don’t take a first date here. We were allowed just the one go at ordering, so tried some incredible deep-fried prawn dumplings with wasabi mayo and a side of shredded duck burger with hoisin sauce in which the duck was a little dry and the bun more like pastry. By this point, however, and all of 28 minutes after sitting down, we got a sense that we’d already outstayed our welcome. Like a fool, I asked for some mango pomelo sago, one of my favourite Asian puddings, or, failing that, to try another of the sweet things on the menu, be it grass jelly with taro balls or deep-fried glutinous rice cakes with brown sugar, but there were no puddings at all available that day. And that, alas, is where most such TikTok places fall down, once the hype hits big-time. For the beleaguered staff having to deal with the daily stampede, the customer is merely a unit that needs moving through the system, and feasibly a one-time visitor, too. I lived in the Lake District long enough to know the feeling of being a minor burden when you’re trying to give people money. Noodle Inn is utterly delicious, yes, but there are equally wonderful noodles available just streets away, where you can book a table, linger and order as much as you desire. Frankly, though, that isn’t the point. The world is currently queueing for food on Old Compton Street, and if you don’t, you can’t say that you’ve done it.

INSERT INTO reviews VALUES(669,'2024-11-24T06:00:05Z','The Martlet, Rochdale: ‘A victory of professionalism’ – restaurant review','The Martlet, Rochdale Town Hall, OL16 1AZ. Lunch plates £10; main courses £14 – £21; desserts £5; afternoon tea £21. Evening menu: three courses £35. Wines from £22 a bottle It’s easy to imagine the ways by which the Martlet in Rochdale could have gone so very wrong; how the perceived demands of civic responsibility and the innate grinding conservatism of bureaucracy could have resulted in a dull, mediocre offering for the town. It wouldn’t even have been worth rolling your eyes at. It would have been understandable. The Martlet is a new restaurant inside Rochdale’s magnificent Town Hall. Since 2021, the building has undergone an equally magnificent restoration, to bring this slab of Victorian gothic revival by William Henry Crossland, into a golden, glowing focus. There is finely chiselled stonework, stained-glass windows and wood-panelled chambers with intricate foliage-strewn wall coverings recalling the work of William Morris. Ceiling panels are decorated with branch and leaf, upon which perch fully plumed peacocks and illustrations of the martlet, a mythical bird that was forever on the wing. Whatever you do, make time to drift slack-jawed through these chambers. Perhaps while wearing a pale, lace-fringed linen smock dress and kohl eyeliner. I could rock that look. Such a new civic amenity needed some sort of food and drink outlet. They could have installed a modish and frankly annoying pan-European small plates bistro that nobody wanted. Or it could have been a bog-standard coffee and cake job. The Martlet does have the latter covered. There is good coffee and cake available here. But it is so much more. It’s a broad offering drawing on the heritage of Greater Manchester in a smart, witty and generous way, and all at the sort of prices that will make those used to shaking down their bank accounts for a bit of lunch, sigh deeply. Head chef Darren Parkinson grew up locally and trained at Hopwood Hall College just four minutes’ walk away, before a career which took him to France, Winteringham Fields in Lincolnshire and the Shibden Mill Inn near Halifax. Now he’s back home with a menu that touches many bases. You can come early for a full English, or a Bombay breakfast of fried eggs, mango chutney, onion bhajis and flatbreads. At lunchtime there’s a list of platters for £10, a couple of which have the echo of that imagined small plates bistro. There’s a soft herb risotto with truffled nuts and pecorino, or a salad of pickled beetroot, radishes and goat’s cheese dressed with white balsamic. Substitute tofu to make it vegan. It all sounds lovely, but I’m here for the boulder of breadcrumb-crusted Scotch egg, made with Bury black pudding, with the heft of white pepper. Cut in and the yolk runs away. Underneath is a thick bed of their own piccalilli, which has crunch and softness, sweetness and acidity. It’s a class piece of work. Or get the sausage roll, which arrives sliced into five finger-ready pieces. The puff pastry is as inflated as a peacock’s tail feathers, and each piece is topped by a properly spicy curry sauce ketchup. Swipe away at any that’s left over with the very good chips. To one side of the menu is a panel entitled Rochdale Town Hall Classics, all for £14. Alongside fish and chips, which come with Manchester caviar (mushy peas, of course), there’s a bacon chop with more of the Bury black pudding and, joy of joys, a rag pudding. If you’ve not encountered one before, it’s a parcel-shaped pie, named because of the way the suet pastry is hand-folded over the filling to make it look like a bundle of the cotton rags which once underpinned the region’s industrial economy. It encloses a thick, gooey filling of both braised and minced beef. The flaky pastry has the crack you get only with animal fats and it sits in a knee-depth reservoir of gravy so glossy you could check your hair and make up in the reflection. With it are crisp-edged hasselback potatoes and minted garden peas, with more depth and maturity than their petit brethren. (A quick aside: the first time I met the great Manchester chef Rob Owen Brown, I asked him why he listed his grilled Barnsley chop as coming with little peas. “Because you’re in Manchester,” he said, tartly. “They’re not petit pois. They’re little peas.”) From the grills section comes a Gloucester Old Spot pork chop for £17, which more than matches the rag pudding for value. It is the thickness of a copy of Jilly Cooper’s Rivals and just as satisfying. There is a seared ribbon of fat at its back, guaranteed to sustain you through a Rochdale winter, and it comes with cherry tomatoes, roasted on the vine until they are just about to burst lasciviously from their skins. There are wedges of sweet-sour apple which maintain their structural integrity and a goblet of thick-cut chips. There are roasted carrots and portobello mushrooms and another of the meaty sauces the kitchen has nailed. Note: if you attempt to treat the Scotch egg as a starter, before either of these mains, you may find portion size challenging. In these parts that’s quite as it should be. It is an early midweek lunchtime and the vaulting room, in shades of rhubarb and custard with huge drapes at the cathedral-high windows, is doing a brisk trade. Apparently, it’s even busier on a Friday and Saturday evening, when Parkinson does a more formal menu, offering mackerel and crab from Whitby to start, followed by a beef wellington and then sticky toffee pudding with a miso caramel. It’s a mighty £35 for three courses, or £30 for two. To finish today there’s lemon drizzle cake or a Victoria sponge, baked on site, alongside a white chocolate parfait or a slab of Garstang blue with an eccles cake, among other things. But they are here to feed at all hours, so they also do an afternoon tea at £21 a head, and we have been admiring the glazed and risen scones parading occasionally across the room. So we nibble on one of those that comes with both butter and a scoop of clotted cream, alongside the jam. Don’t ask which order any of this should be applied because, whisper it, I really don’t care. It’s a great scone, slightly misshapen and popping with sultanas. But then it’s all been great, so by this point we expect nothing less. The Martlet is a victory of professionalism, good sense and, most of all, great taste and skill. It’s a recognition that a thoughtful, well-conceived restaurant can be as much of a civic amenity for its community as anything else for which the council is responsible. Every town should have one. News bites Roy Brett, chef-proprietor of Edinburgh seafood restaurant Ondine Oyster and Grill, has announced it is relocating from the upper-floor space in the city’s Old Town, which it has occupied since 2009. In an Instagram post he explained that the scaffolding across the front of the building, which has already been in place for a few years, will go on for a while longer and he’s had enough. The last service will be on 31 December. A new location is yet to be announced. Meanwhile, Brett is preparing to open a second Ondine inside the new Seaton House hotel in St Andrews, which opens next February (ondinerestaurant.co.uk). Much loved Thai restaurant Singburi in Leytonstone, northeast London, has closed its doors after announcing it was “going on sabbatical” to give the staff “time to ruminate”. Lengthy closures are not unusual at Singburi. They just tend to cover the start of each year. Last year they closed just before Christmas and didn’t reopen until late March. The small, family run restaurant, which started as a fish and chip shop, is currently listed at number 71 in the National Restaurant Awards top 100. Follow them on Instagram @singburi_e11 And a follow-up to last week’s story about the closure, in Lyme Regis, of Mark Hix’s Oyster &amp; Fish House. The site is being taken over by Mitch Tonks’ Rockfish group and will reopen in the new year. “Although I will be sad to see the Oyster &amp; Fish House close next month,” Hix has said. “I do feel the time is right and I cannot think of a better fit than Rockfish to take its place” (therockfish.co.uk).

Desiyewtree.com. No reservations. Starters £4.50 – £11; Sharing grill platters £12 – £22; Main dishes £8.50 – £13. Beer from £4 a pint I am but a man; as easily suggestible as any rampant digestive system attached to an equally rampant mouth. Show me a picture of a steaming bowl of ramen, the burnished rings of chashu pork peeking shyly from the cloudy broth, and I will immediately know that this is the only thing I wish to eat. Forever. Or at least for lunch. The hanging Cantonese roasted ducks, pressing their red and gold breasts to the windows of Chinatown restaurants, aren’t just a serving suggestion to me. They are benign sirens, calling me irresistibly to the table. I know how sophisticated food photography has become. That doesn’t stop the baser animal part of me, the bit throbbing away in some rudely undeveloped fold of my brain, demanding that I find a way to get my mouth around whatever I’m looking at. I like to think of myself as discerning and sophisticated; in truth, I am merely an advertiser’s dream. Which explains why, a few weeks ago in Wolverhampton, after interviewing the director of a new documentary about Britain’s Desi pubs in front of an audience for a recording of Radio 4’s Kitchen Cabinet, I immediately jumped in a cab and directed it to one just over the ring road. Zaki Solosho, who was born and raised in London’s Southall, had done such a good job of describing the allure in these brilliant places of the mixed grill, sizzling with seekh kebabs and lamb chops, chicken tikka and the rest, that I needed to be eating one. It was as simple as that. The film, Desi: A Pub Story, commissioned by the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra), is an intriguingly subversive piece of work. It introduces itself as a food story about pubs which house kitchens serving up dishes from across the Indian-subcontinent (to which the word “Desi” refers). Cue lingering shots of those smoky kebabs, and deep-sauced curries, and bubbled and blistered naan breads the size of satellite dishes. But the highly stimulating food porn is actually a way into an incisive piece of anthropology. It digs deep into the racism experienced by early immigrants to the UK from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, the primacy of the National Front in Southall in the 1970s, and how enterprising members of the community took over a classic institution of the very culture, which had done its best to exclude them – the pub – and made it their own. In doing so, they created places that have been so successful they have now become symbols not of exclusion, but of inclusion. The heart of the clientele is always the local Desi community. These are their places. But now they attract a very mixed crowd. That’s what I find when I arrive at the Desi Yew Tree, a blocky building in the city’s light industrial Graiseley district, which started serving food 15 years ago. It’s a 20-minute walk from Wolverhampton Wanderers’ Molineux Stadium. On match days, supporters park up here for a drink before, and then come back for dinner after. Immediately inside is the bar, lined with Carling, Cobra and Madrí Excepcional on draught. To the right is the long, narrow, main dining room. To one side, behind a huge picture window so you can watch flames leap and naans being slapped into tandoors, is the kitchen. There are also multiple TV screens, some large for general viewing, some smaller and set into the wall by the booths. Tonight, all of them are screening a Liverpool v Leverkusen Uefa Champions League game. I say this as if I understand the significance of these words. I do not. I know only that men are chasing a ball across a green field and that others are shouting at them. A key part of Solosho’s film challenges the presumption of homogeneity with Desi pubs; that they are all basically the same thing. A community drawing on immigration from Bangladesh, Pakistan and the vastness of India is not homogeneous. It also changes with social mobility. Yes, they are always going to serve those grills and kebabs, but the menu here is not, for example, the same as at the Sportsman Club in West Bromwich, which I visited early last year. Here, the kitchen is a separate business to the pub and is run by the Nepalese Gaire family, which explains a few dishes described as “Himalayan” among the chef’s specials. There’s the dense Himalayan fish curry, of white fillets in a thick, lightly sour gravy full of whole roasted spices, crushed curry leaves and fresh coriander. There’s also Potato 65, which here has a distinct Indo-Chinese sweetness. The dry-fried potatoes are still crisp through the mustard-seed rich coating. (If you want to disappear down an internet rabbit hole, go look for the origins of the “65” thing, originally applied to a fried chicken dish from Chennai. It may be because it was the 65th dish on the menu. Or that it was first made in 1965. Or that the first recipe used 65 ingredients, which seems unlikely.) Then there is the “medium sizzler” for £18, a tottering platter of chicken wings and tikka, of seekh kebabs, lamb chops and brilliant, turmeric-yellow fish pakora. Note the price. Note the Devil’s Tower scale. Do not focus too much on the exuberant use of vibrant red food colouring, or even whether these are the finest examples of their kind. They probably aren’t, but for the price they are extremely solid. Apply splodges of thick tamarind sauce and mint raita from the plastic squeezy bottles on the table, to send these grills on their way. For us tonight the star dish is the rara gosht, the brownest of brown stews made with both minced lamb and whole braised pieces of meat, so that texturally it is falling apart in multiple directions. It is sweet with clove, cinnamon and bay and comforting on a night when a cold autumn mist hangs over Wolverhampton. We dredge away with the buttered naans that we had watched being made only a few minutes before. It is a matter of deep dismay and sadness to me that tonight I am staying nearby in a hotel room without a fridge, so I can’t take what is left away with me. With one glass of wine each we have run up a bill of £48, but seem to have enough food for four. It’s just part of the brilliance of Desi pub culture. Do follow @zakisolosho on Instagram to find out where you can see his terrific film. News bites Proof that London is quickly becoming a sandwich hotspot: De Santis, which first opened in 1964 and which is regarded as the best sandwich shop in Milan, has launched its first outpost outside Italy. It is located in the crypt of the building occupied by Mercato Metropolitano on North Audley Street in Mayfair. Their range includes the Bologna made with gorgonzola, mortadella and pepper jam, and the Angel, filled with anchovies, stracciatella and green tomatoes. It also serves charcuterie and cheese boards alongside cocktails (paninidesantis.it). The Japanese-inspired Maneki Ramen, which launched in Worcester in 2021, is crowdfunding to launch its second outpost in Birmingham’s Jewellery Quarter. They are looking to raise £95,000 and have a range of rewards available in returns for funds, including credits in either of the restaurants, plus the chance to be cooked for by Maneki head chef Pete Dovaston at film director Guy Ritchie’s Wild Kitchen. Find out more here. Meanwhile the Savoy Hotel on London’s Strand has launched two new dining options. The Thames Foyer space has become the Gallery Restaurant, with menu items that will include sole tacos, Cornish tuna tataki and a charcoal grilled chicken tikka pie, all apparently taking cues from the classics created by famed Savoy chef Auguste Escoffier. Elsewhere in the building they have opened a dedicated scone shop called Scoff, selling scones filled with the likes of tiramisu, fruit punch and, of course, strawberries and cream (thesavoylondon.com).

You’ll hear this repeated by chefs and food writers whenever Thompson’s name is mentioned, and his work genuinely warrants genuflection. Without him, it is said, there would be no Som Saa, no Kiln, no Smoking Goat, no Speedboat Bar, nor many of those other hip Thai eating spots run by earnest boys called Crispin who serve kipper curry to other earnest boys called Crispin. Thompson did not by any means invent the concept of Thai people eating – they’ve been managing perfectly well by themselves since the country was created in the 13th century – but he certainly dismantled the UK’s love of gelatinous yet sating pad Thais and of boiled chicken pieces swimming in tinned coconut milk and masquerading as green curry. When he opened Nahm in 2001, Thompson laughed in the face of the predictable, cosy and safe Thai food we’d been used to – comforting sweetness and nuttiness, with gentle, fragrant wafts of coriander and unthreatening heat – and instead favoured scallops, pigeon, Asian celery, white pepper and often alarmingly bold levels of both fresh and dried chillies. Twenty years on, in a rather chaotically styled venue in the heart of London’s theatreland, there’s little evidence that he’s mellowing much. Long Chim has taken over the ground floor of Hovarda, a restaurant I once walked out of because they wouldn’t let me have a walk-in table unless I gave them my name, phone number and postcode, and which still operates from the first floor. Anyway, the ground level space has been rejigged with garish decor and a clanking open kitchen, and seems to have been inspired by a design palette that screams: “This could be a Bangkok street food scene, right, guys?” complete with bold neon signs, animal murals and studiously staged piles of bottles. At times, the lighting is purple, at others blue, should you have ever wondered how you’d look as a Smurf. Why do designers persist in trying to recreate “the street” indoors? It always looks like a themed shooting range at Chessington World of Adventures. The menu, meanwhile, leans on the side of crowdpleasers, with monkfish curry, crispy pork in five spices and “Long Chim rolls”, which turn out to be long, thin, slightly wonky, crisp spring rolls stuffed with a non-obtrusive mulch of mustard greens. Be warned, though, this menu is startlingly brief, featuring a mere four starters – a couple of skewers, those spring rolls, rice cakes with crunchy pork – seven mains and the briefest of nods towards pudding; the rice option is steamed jasmine or no rice at all. “Long chim” translates loosely as “come and try”, and you literally could try everything here on a single visit. The menu feels as if it began life as something a bit more ambitious – the pre-opening hype promised wagyu beef salad and red snapper fishcakes, for instance – and seems somewhat meagre when compared with, for instance, those at nearby Kiln and Speedboat. It’s punchily priced, too: a single skewer of admittedly delicious grilled beef with turmeric, galangal and coriander costs £8, while a suggestion of southern-style grilled squid with ginger is £6 a nibble. Two black tiger prawns with celery, spring onions and glass vermicelli (£19) all sang in the same key: white pepper. The pomegranate salad was a thick, rather jammy bowl of rich red fruit that acted as a welcome foil to the mellow monkfish curry with a cucumber relish. My advice here would be to order big, if your wallet allows it, or you might well leave still a bit hungry, in which vein we ordered both the desserts on offer. Grilled sticky rice with banana was exactly that: grilled lumps of rice with hot banana. The other pudding, however, turned out to be the star of the entire evening. Tapioca with coconut and corn was a complex and pretty bowl of wobbly frogspawn with sunrise-yellow corn. And before any of you start, there’s no such thing as bad tapioca: it is the saviour of a million 1970s British schoolchildren’s teatimes, and it’s widely loved across Thailand, too. Long Chim is a place for Thompson’s many fans to head to pay homage to a culinary legend. If they’re lucky, they might even catch the man himself behind the stoves, so they’ll be able to thank him in person for the impact he’s had on the UK’s approach to Thai dining. Long Chim may not be quite his best work, but the fact that he will always be remembered is not up for debate. Long Chim 36-40 Rupert Street, London W1, 020-3319 7750.

The service will be slow, the butter will come in naff wrapped portions, and chipper staff will squat at my table between courses and ask: “Any favourites so far?” Before then, however, I’ll digest 2024 and regurgitate my findings. My year began recovering from a mini-break in Murwillumbah with Nigel Farage and Fred Sirieix. Food terrible. Tripadvisor: 1 star. Do not recommend. On my return, my first stop was my beloved King Cookdaily, a vegan kiosk with seats in Shoreditch that serves heavenly Lao bowls, udon and jerk. By the end of 2024, however, restaurant-land’s enthusiasm for “the vegan craze” has sunk like a chickpea-juice meringue. The will of most restaurants simply to stay afloat this year, serving whatever valve or offcut they can, has drowned any urge to do something meaningful with costly aubergines. Instead, we had Bébé Bob, which serves only chicken, and Eggslut, with its £15 egg sandwiches. Elsewhere, and more positively, I was smitten with Sète in Margate, the Blue Pelican in Deal and the Shed in Swansea – all fine examples of how, these days, it’s often “not London” where indies can let their imaginations fly, not least because the rent is so much cheaper. Whyte’s in Hackney, with its Monster Munch-encrusted oysters, was also a revelation. And no matter what the landlords are charging for the prime real estate around Borough Market, there has been a real fervour to open in the area. Any sane foodie views the market itself as a bacon-scented stampede to avoid like the pox, especially from Friday to Sunday, yet over the past 12 months Camille, Oma and Café François have all appeared on nearby streets, and each one of them is exemplary in its own field. Camille and Café François are both French, delicious and convivial as heck. They do a vadouvan monkfish and a Paris-Brest at Café François that are worth dumping your friends for and eating alone. In other news, Londoners have found themselves increasingly steered towards Canary Wharf for dinner, with capacious, aircraft hangar-sized new openings from the likes of Roe, Marceline, Caravan, Blacklock, Kricket and Dishoom, as well as the plant-based Holy Cow and Mallow. If you’re ever stuck for a group table within the M25, just go to Canary Wharf; there will be one free there. That said, if you have no plans to visit the Big Smoke, which is entirely understandable, please book Brett in Glasgow, a small bistro with an enormous heart and a world-class modern European menu, and one of my meals of the year. Or do a Sunday lunch at Dipna Anand’s rather lovely joint in Milton Keynes. And please don’t miss out on the absolutely wonderful fancy fish-and-chip restaurant Noah’s in Bristol. Calling Noah’s a chippy doesn’t do this seafood extravaganza justice, which at the time I described as “Captain Birdseye opens a fancy 1980s wine bar with Simon Le Bon”. Meanwhile, the Brummies have been hiding the excellent fine-dining, post-punk industrial wine cave Albatross Death Cult from outsiders. That was Charles’s dinner of the year, so much so that he has threatened to return solo to enjoy the full 12 courses again, this time in glorious silence. Although I often grumble, lovely times have been frequent in 2024. I adore the Dover near Piccadilly in London, because it’s the most glam, softly lit, eccentric, old-fashioned new restaurant in the capital. Sure, it serves fancy spaghetti and lobster rolls, but that’s not quite the point – it’s a scene. Morchella in Clerkenwell is quietly fabulous, and I also recommend Cloth in Farringdon and Leydi next to the Old Bailey to everybody who asks for a tipoff; the latter’s deluxe enormo-meze at £50 a head is fabulous value and the room is ever so elegant. And Mary’s, one of Jason Atherton’s many new London openings, served me a calvados and apple-stuffed doughnut that was well worth the flushed cheeks. Go to all of them, if you can, but remember the 2024 don’ts. Don’t go anywhere influencers have pretended to eat world-changing stacks of pancakes. And just as you should never get involved in a land war in Asia, it’s probably wise not to get involved in a queue for biang biang noodles in Soho, either. Don’t eat the chestnuts at Oxford Circus. Don’t ask Jay Rayner if he knows any jazz tunes, especially if he’s within grasping range of a piano. Don’t forget to tip your servers – they’re the backbone of the country. And don’t listen to restaurant critics. We are cosseted, overfed babies, carting our cellulite and wine-fed rosacea around eateries to find fault in dirty cutlery and split sauces while half the world is hungry. I’ll no doubt be replaced by AI by next Christmas, but while it lasts, it’s a hell of a ride.

Despite being a magnet for the Cotswolds arts scene, the town has long slid under the radar of most folk fleeing London in search of fresh air. Deal, Aldeburgh, Hastings? Absolutely. But Stroud? Not so much. But now there is Juliet, complete with a back story that will prick the ears of all right-thinking foodie types, because this is an all-day modern European bistro dreamed up by the sculptor Daniel Chadwick. It serves mousse de canard with a translucent layer of glorious fat to spread on fresh baguette, bowls of clams with chickpeas and girolles, and devilled eggs with trout roe. If you’re an early bird, Juliet opens from 9.30am Monday to Saturday for coffee and freshly baked madeleines. Chadwick, whose other joint is the Woolpack, a much-loved hostelry in Slad just up the road, is my favourite type of hospitality character. He is vision-led, distinctly non-corporate and propelled by an urge to take old things and re-love them. For many decades, the Woolpack was famous for being the favourite watering hole of the author Laurie Lee. It could have closed down or become a soulless tourist trap, but in Chadwick’s hands it is back to being a working, breathing, archly boho local boozer with a history, a library, a crackling fire, a fabulous menu and outdoor loos with cold seats that certainly woke me up when I spent a penny there in deepest winter a couple of years ago. Juliet, meanwhile, is fresh evidence of just what happens when Chadwick “has a good idea”. He has whisked several of the Woolpack team into town, including chefs Adam Glover and Oliver Gyde, and installed a fabulous front-of-house in Ophélie Théberge, a wine expert who apparently was actually born on a vineyard. Their new restaurant lives in the former Stroud Music Centre, a well-established, albeit neglected venue that’s perched on a corner not far from the train station and is now painted bright white. If the Woolpack is rustic and errs on the rough and ready, Juliet is its la-di-da cousin with combed hair. It has a crisp, pale, stylish decor and an atmosphere – and wine list – that lures you in to enjoy the “service non-stop” as the French still often call it. After those 9.30am madeleines and coffees, you can shift to a Suze and tonic while perusing the plat du jour, which on the day we visited was freshly made bullets of cavatelli in a rich duck ragu; on other days there have been mackerel in bisque and polenta with braised lamb and olives. In a discreet side room, named “the Piano Room”, there’s an upright joanna and convivial tinkling while you eat one of the daily offerings of bavette with peppercorn sauce and a side of ratte potatoes. Juliet, which is named after Chadwick’s wife, is one of those places where diners can lose track of time. We arrived at 1pm and left at 3.30pm, by which time some of the other diners seemed to have already bedded in for the evening. We began with a round of alcohol-free clementine gimlets and some crisp, herby sage panisse, followed by a round of oeufs mayonnaise with large, salty Cantabrian anchovies – the glossy, thick and fresh mustardy mayo was a particular delight. As was the smooth, rich earthiness of that pink duck mousse, which showcased beautiful, precise cooking. A bowl of baked delica squash dripped with a rich tapenade of olive oil and almond, while a bowl of homemade pickled carrot, cauliflower and endive was just the right amount of bite, sharpness and sweetness. I was less fond of the artichoke barigoule, although my friend Hugh disagreed and gobbled it up. To his credit, though, he did give me the biggest share of the day’s plat. I adore fresh cavatelli – they have all the plump, sating qualities of gnocchi, but without the fluffiness of potato. Here at Juliet they came in abundance in that rich, pleasantly unrefined duck stew. As we ordered dessert, the other guests didn’t seem to notice that day was turning to night outside. Passersby walked in and joined tables. Speaking of dessert, special acknowledgment has to be made to Juliet’s apple tarte tatin, because it’s one of the best I have ever demolished. Tarte tatin is a tricky beast, but Juliet’s is caramelised to the point of deepest mahogany, while the fruit somehow still retains its structure, and the thin, crisp pastry cuts in perfect slices. Served with chantilly, it was breathtaking. Juliet is seriously worth a schlep to Stroud, but you had better book well in advance. Right now, it seems, the locals are settling in for winter. Juliet 49 London Road, Stroud, Gloucestershire, 01453 367019. Open Mon-Sat, lunch noon-2.30pm, dinner 6-9.30pm (bar menu noon-9.30pm).

There are proudly British ingredients – Hebridean hogget, Cornish monkfish and crown prince pumpkin. And they’re cooked with Thai expertise in a kitchen led by John Chantarasak, who was brought up in Wales and trained at Le Cordon Bleu in Bangkok, where his father was born, and who, alongside his wife, sommelier and co-owner Desiree, has been beloved by the London food scene for several years now. Many new restaurants are said to be “much anticipated”, but in AngloThai’s case it has been anticipated for so many years now that many had given up hope of it ever becoming a reality. But you realise almost the moment you walk through the door where all that time went, because creating something as beautiful as this takes money and a great deal of planning. You need an interior created by Thai-American designer May Redding, complete with strategically placed Lampang Province ceramics to help attract a clientele who’ll be happy to stump up the £30 supplement to add Brixham crab, caviar and coconut crackers to their tasting menu. This isn’t Soho or Shoreditch; this is a smart restaurant close to Edgware Road where Anglo and Thai influences collide with the requisite levels of pomp and fire. If the reimagining of authentic Thai food has been an ongoing plotline in the British food landscape over the past 15 years, here at AngloThai we see it dangle a pedicured toe into modern fine-dining territory. We began with non-alcoholic sunflower seed sours, made with Herb All spirit, Botivo aperitivo and egg white, that had all the weirdness of a proper cocktail with none of the headache. After that, we had jus de raisin, which some posh restaurants are currently selling for £30 a bottle to generations who are far too young to remember Shloer. Then it was on to a set of complex amuse-bouches, starting with a comice pear perched on a small plinth of candied beetroot. Eat it in one bite, we were instructed, and I complied like a boa constrictor: it was crunchy, sweet and dotted with nutty Duchess Farm rapeseed. Next, a Carlingford oyster, served in its shell and drenched in a thoughtful, fire-red and brutally spicy fermented chilli dressing with sea buckthorn. “This heat has actually made me giddy,” said my friend Hugh, batting away the flames. “My eyes are watering, and I can’t feel my nose,” I replied. Then a dainty parcel of spiced lemongrass-scented pork in thin tempura on a hand-thrown plate; battered sausage has never tasted so good. If AngloThai, with its caviar and comice frippery, sounds a bit stiff and daunting, it absolutely isn’t. It is most definitely good fun, with a buzzy, youngish clientele and 1980s Madonna on the playlist – not too loud that it drowns conversation, but rather at that rare sweet spot where you can talk freely with some privacy. The front of house are knowledgable, and clearly proud of Chantarasak’s ingenuity, but they never overstay their welcome, even when explaining why the restaurant doesn’t serve rice, and instead offers up more sustainable British grains – the night we visited, the evening’s starch was barley simmered in a little lamb fat, which was rustic and really rather lovely. Those same servers will also tip you off as to how good the thinly sliced, top-quality tomatillo draped over cured chalk stream trout is, or how the Wildfarmed bread course is made glossy with shrimp butter. But they’ll be off soon thereafter, and leave you to your chamchuri wood chair under flattering Ban Pa Ao lighting, listening to Into The Groove and chewing on a mouthful of exquisite hogget massaman curry with plenty of deeply bronzed shallot and a slick of rich, but not overpoweringly coconutty sauce. There is an understated elegance to just about everything that AngloThai does – there are jet-black crackers in the shape of Michelin stars (accidental, perhaps?) and a dessert in which a rich, duck egg custard enrobes a thinly shaved pumpkin tart that more closely resembles an art installation than a pudding – but if you simply want to be fed, there is also a sating bowl of wok-fired long aubergine that still retain their form and some bite, to eat with dainty homemade pickles. Friends of mine have been back to AngloThai again and again since it opened in late November, having become addicted to those aubergines and the caviar crackers, but for most people this will be a special-occasion restaurant. AngloThai may have been a long time coming, but it is certainly feels set to stick around. AngloThai 22-24 Seymour Place, London W1, 020-3307 8800.

Has there been a power cut?’ – restaurant review | Grace Dent on restaurants','Toum, a modern Lebanese rotisserie with French culinary influences and chic cocktail-bar vibes, has recently appeared just off Regent Street, near Hamleys toy store. I often use Hamleys as a landmark for non-Londoners, because they might not find directions such as “It’s on Maddox Street, close to the Kingly Street food drag” all that useful, but may very well have experienced, or at least heard of, Hamleys’ daily “Friends Parade” with Professor Bubbles. If so, Toum is all of five minutes’ walk away, and serves cold tomatillo martinis and, more importantly, posh rotisserie chicken from a grill behind the chefs’ heads that’s in full view as you approach the front door. So very inviting. Or at least it is on social media. Toum is the pared-back sibling of Aline up the road, it’s open seven days a week and has a beautiful vinyl listening bar called Encore in the basement. While Aline offers a lengthy celebration of traditional Lebanese comfort food – two dozen meze, and sea bass and lamb chops from the grill – Toum keeps things simple, especially at lunchtime, when it’s even simpler still. There’s that humble roast chicken – described by breathless bloggers as “impossibly juicy” – served with toum (garlic sauce), although chimichurri and Café de Paris butter are on offer, too. There’s also a steak option and a vegetarian aubergine schnitzel, as well as a light waft of meze – well, hummus, pickles and that’s about it. Then again, in surroundings as elegant as these, with staff dressed so nicely and that rotating grill filled with succulent, Lebanese-spiced chicken by the front door, who would need anything more? Well, I’ll begin by “needing” a rotisserie chicken, because the problem with any restaurant that says: “We don’t serve much, but what we do serve, we’re experts at”, leaves itself zero room for manoeuvre. At lunchtime a couple of weeks ago, with Regent Street in full sales bedlam mode, we arrive to find a flurry of staff on the floor, a chef behind the counter, managers at the bar having one of those laptop meetings that are always so conducive to a convivial welcome, but, oddly, no chickens on that acclaimed grill. In fact, it is turned off and the rotisserie is very much not rotating. Has there been a power cut? Have they not paid the electricity bill? “Are you … open?” I ask. Apparently so, though I smell no food. We’re presented with menus on which the £20 rotisserie poulet frites is definitely on offer. Our server disappears to get us some water, but no other drinks are offered, even though there is definitely a bar, because I can see it. “No one on the floor has been trained,” I say forlornly, as I always do in restaurants that sound fabulous on paper and were clearly firing on all cylinders that night six weeks ago when all the influencers loved their free chicken. We order the £9.50 hummus doused with bright green olive oil and topped with crunchy fried chickpeas that are cold, but nevertheless delicious. The hummus itself is nothing to pine for, though – this is no Oma or Leydi hummus, or indeed anything touched by our Lord God Yotam Ottolenghi. A side of pickles at £4.50 is very good, with lots of crunchy, sharp celery, carrot and baby beetroot; in fact, it’s possibly the highlight of lunch. The house bread is a small, chunky, unlovable wretch of a flatbread that’s the size of my palm and comes with a teaspoon’s-worth of oil. Then – huzzah! – the chicken, which seems to be mysteriously self-cooking and has patently been lurking downstairs in its anonymous “Lebanese-spiced” glaze, along with a handful of unsalted shoestring fries and a small bowl of inoffensive chimichurri. Allegedly half a chicken, this is instead a small portion comprising a bit of breast and a leg with browned skin, and it’s nothing remotely earth-changing. On the other hand, I will never forget the aubergine schnitzel vegetarian option, featuring a half-aubergine steamed – or had it been boiled? – to the texture of a bloated sanitary towel. This moist slab was encrusted in a green, herb-based powder and came on a mound of yoghurt. It felt like vegetarian cooking by someone who had been emotionally wounded by a vegetarian – this was personal. I sent it back almost untouched, but the management continued their meeting at the bar, tapping their laptops and never once checking if we’d eaten our food, or offering cocktails, or anything else that might help keep Toum’s doors open. We ordered dessert – a £9.50 chocolate mousse with a layer of fruit gel – then left after paying the £83.19 bill and skipping past that redundant rotisserie, which was still turned off. There were no chickens there, but I was spitting feathers. Toum 18a Maddox Street, London W1 (no phone). Open all week, noon-10.30pm (Sun 5pm).

This watering hole is number one on Estrella Damm’s gastropub list, it’s Michelin Guide-listed and it has nabbed various other gongs. Still, whenever I write about an allegedly “good” pub that serves the likes of poussin terrine and halibut in vermouth, there’s a backlash from men (and it’s always men; not one woman – not ever) harrumphing that this is not a “real pub”, because it doesn’t serve Warton’s Old Scratchy and it has fitted carpets rather than, say, straw. In the Unruly Pig’s defence, however, while it may indeed be a bit fancy or, rather, artily boho, owner Brendan Padfield has grasped tightly on to its innate pubbiness. This is a 16th-century inn with Regency period add-ons, and although these days there may be some quirky Lego conceptual art in reception and modern prints and propaganda art on every wall, it is nevertheless still a rather dark, snug pub, with crooked ceilings, exposed beams, log burners and a loo up olde worlde winding stairs. The Unruly Pig feels very much like a building that has lived a proper life, not least when it almost burned down 10 years ago. Padfield, crestfallen but undeterred, rebuilt the place, only bigger and brighter. All that said, it is head chef Dave Wall’s menu where any notions of the place being an everyday boozer run dry. There is no buttermilk chicken burger or pulled pork in a bap here. Wall doesn’t do traditional crowdpleasers – unless it’s for a crowd of seasoned foodies who want white onion velouté with Ibérico ham and taleggio crostini or smoked cod’s roe tartlets topped with avruga caviar. The Unruly Pig even offers a tasting menu where, for £79, you’ll be whipped through seven courses including venison loin with caramelised salsify and a passion fruit, pineapple and rum panna cotta. There is a separate vegetarian alternative that also pulls no punches at all. Wall is an imaginative, slightly maverick chef who’ll take a wobbly octopus tentacle, grill it so the wispy end is blackened and the thicker flesh still soft, then serve it with ’nduja and anchovy emulsion and pickled onions. His food is go-hard or go-home eating. A less, well, unruly chef might use parmesan in a delica pumpkin risotto, but here the mustard-coloured rice is laced with whiffy cashel blue, dressed with crisp sage leaves and comes in a perfect circle with an equally perfect outer ring of black garlic sauce. Similar immaculate circles appear on other mains and desserts, and my nosey questioning revealed that there’s a “turntable” in the kitchen to make the plate styling just so. Highlights of our lunch included hand-dived Orkney scallop crudo with slivers of caperberry, a thick, delicious black-olive tapenade and a judicious suggestion of Gentleman’s Relish. A generous slab of beautifully cooked steamed halibut came on a sea-green mussel, potato and seaweed ragu with capers and raisins, and was both completely unusual and utterly marvellous. Then, delighting my sweet tooth, a chocolate and hazelnut tart, which turned out to be more a big slab of ganache topped with glossy chunks of blood orange marmalade and served in a Frangelico sauce. Ah, Frangelico, in all its herby, nutty majesty – it’s no longer just a duty-free classic, bought to please tricky Aunty June who doesn’t really drink at family occasions; now it also sits pretty on gastropub menus. So, yes, you could argue that the Unruly Pig isn’t the greatest gastropub in the United Kingdom, because any such claim would be silly. Perhaps you’d just like a decent fancy £20 beef burger and sticky toffee pudding with custard, and such needs and wants are totally valid. This is a pub for the adventurous diner who is happy to enjoy the culinary ride. On a cold January day, we ate well and, more than that, memorably, then drove down to nearby Shingle Street beach for a blustery walk in the precious afternoon daylight.

This sleek, moderately fancy celebration of all things from Athens to the coast of Crete is currently working hard to channel a sun-kissed sojourn on the Aegean, in winter, in London. Yet step inside, away from the concrete and drizzle outside, and the place is airy, opulent and verging on the semi-Californian. This is movie-set Greece hewn in tones of dappled, early evening Athenian sunshine, all bronze, peach, tan and gold, and enhanced with tasteful lighting, velvety soft furnishings and comfortable leather banquettes. Before I walked in, I was just a woman in thermals with a flaky nose, but then – bang! – I’m suddenly Christina Onassis sipping a mulberry mournoraki in a rustic yet dashingly chic taverna. All this and a kitchen headed by Angelos Togias, ex of the Connaught, and with a clear vision to honour the many wonderful things about modern Greek cooking and ingredients. We begin with a “tasting” of five olive oils in tiny bowls with house flatbread, each of them passionately explained by our server as if they were the finest wines from the cellar. Doesn’t the 245 Organic 0.8% have subtle wafts of citrus and fresh grass? How about the fuller, fruitier aroma of the Mitira Lesvos? As a non-drinker nowadays, I found the ceremony of the experience rather delightful – why do we reserve such nerdiness mainly for wine? But perhaps you’re already saying no, thank you, having been burnt by other renditions of allegedly traditional Greek food in Great Britain. Yes, there are some fine examples out there – my beloved Hand Cafe in Stratford, east London, for one, where sweet bougatsa, good coffee and the likes of fragrant, freshly made courgette and feta strifti are to be found – but who among us has not, at some point, stared sadly at a bowl of roughly chopped red onion, unripe tomato and unlovable, catering-pack feta and muttered: “This is not how the Greek salad was when we were on holiday.” Here at Krokodilos, however, there’s a sense that Togias and his team are aching to change all that. From the dozen or so starter options, some are instantly recognisable. Yes, there’s tarama and whipped fava, through which to scoop some lovely fermented potato flatbread, but there is also much more unusual and unexpected stuff, such as sharp, citrussy stone bass dressed in blood orange and fennel. Even a humble-sounding “beetroot salad” turns out to be a rather complex plate of beets, fermented apple, peanuts, raisins and galomizithra cheese. That apparently predictable taramasalata, by the way, is miles away from the pink, whiffy mush to which we have somehow grown tolerant as a nation. Krokodilos’ “taramas cream” is the richest, most decadent bowl of pale, barley-coloured, salty, cured roe (bottarga from Messolonghi, no less) with a judicious scattering of dill and topped with a runny egg yolk. “I like this place,” I said while devouring this pungent concoction. “It’s well handy.” There are tiny, romantic tables, as well as larger areas for groups, should you need them, plus it’s in a part of London where good, reasonably priced places to eat at and/or entertain are all too rare. The mains menu is equally enthralling. A properly good rabbit stifado, monkfish fricassée, grilled octopus with a vièrge emulsion and lamb dolmadakia … So I was at fault for ordering the prawn saganaki – not because it wasn’t delicious, but because I was wearing white, and foolishly imagined that I’d be able to eat this generous and heady tomato, feta and prawn stew and emerge unsplattered. I began with aplomb, dipping the remains of my wild mushroom-topped flatbread into the sauce, but things got messy very soon thereafter. The front of house, thankfully, feigned ignorance and swept me into the dessert selection, from which the Greek yoghurt with quince and cardamom oil might seem the healthy option, but it is served as if it’s the star of the show, in a supremely elegant glass and with a recommendation to pair it with an eight-year-old Gaia vin santo. We also cleared a karidopita chocolate and walnut cake with kaimaki ice-cream. Krokodilos is flying way under the radar right now, possibly due to its location, the time of year and the fact that its owners have opened so many places at roughly the same time. But what we have here is a very amenable place to spend a couple of hours, imagining you’re feeling the sun on your face when in reality you won’t see it for another six months. Bring a bib, order the saganaki and think of summer. Better days are ahead. Krokodilos Lancer Square, 28A Kensington Church Street, London W8, 020-8191 2783.

In any Venn diagram denoting the commonality between the two, there would be very little in that overlapping section in the middle. Or, more precisely, there would perhaps be just the one word: Tropea. This restaurant in Harborne, named after a sunkissed Italian resort, has made a quiet name for itself over the past few years with its Salizà amaretto sours and provolone arancini to savour at sunset on a charming terrace. Yes, this particular sun terrace may overlook the traffic on the Lordswood Road, but hopefully some of the edges will be blurred after a round of bombardinos. In his memoir, Richard E Grant writes about the human need to find “a pocketful of happiness” in every single day – a phrase that came to mind on entering Tropea late last month. Suddenly, I was out of all the coldness and gloom, and in a roomful of diners defiantly enjoying themselves with gossip, venison ragu tagliatelle and blackberry daiquiris. “We’ll stay for just a couple of plates,” I told Charles, hedging our collective bets. Tropea is not one of those high-street Italian restaurants with red velour chairs, spag bol and breaded mushrooms on the à la carte and a framed portrait of Roberto Baggio in the loo. But then, neither is it one of those “fancy Italians”, where you get a squirrel’s portion of tagliolini in a pale sauce, in a pale room, while listening to Sade covers played on panpipes. Instead, Tropea is a forward-thinking take on the Italian trattoria. Chef Kasia Piątkowska trained at University College Birmingham alongside her now business partner, Ben Robinson-Young, and together they have created a welcoming spot that leans heavily on arty, modern Birmingham, complete with a sleek, navy-blue frontage and, inside, bronzes, warm, sunset oranges and flattering soft lighting. Cool, but not overly cool. This is a restaurant where adventurous mums and dads can treat their student kids to a big £20 plate of gnocchi with gorgonzola dolce and confit red onion, or where mixed groups can catch up semi-noisily over grilled octopus and house red; there’s aubergine parmigiana, too, and tiramisu for dessert if you want something more recognisably “Britaly”. But Tropea is not in the least painfully “big fish small pond” cool. The staff are absurdly friendly, which helped turn our original order of some very good, crunchy cauliflower house pickles, an arancino and a small portion of tagliolini into a full-blown, three-hour lunch. Our plans changed swiftly after the large butternut squash and sage arancino appeared: it was a golden vision, laden with grated provolone and fixed to its spot by a puddle of cheesy butternut sauce. Crunchy, well seasoned, exquisite. A portion of rather thickly cut salt-aged beef carpaccio probably did not need the thick, mayo-style sauce ribboned across it, but it was devoured all the same. We were back on firmer footing with the house-made pasta. Tropea does not go wild in its choice of pasta – there were only four on offer, and two of those were gnocchi and fregola – but quality, not quantity, is what’s important here. The fresh, al dente tagliolini with local black winter truffle was a delight, and came in a meaningful parmesan sauce. Soft, hand-rolled pillows of gnocchi in gorgonzola avoided being one-note by the addition of sweet red onions and a scattering of hazelnuts. Piątkowska and her team run a very good kitchen with a delightful menu, and Harborne is very lucky to have them. From the pasta, we trundled on, admittedly with a few gaps in service, to a whole roast partridge, out of its pear tree and in a red-wine sauce, served on parmesan polenta with buttery chanterelles. The hero dish of lunch, however, was three bronzed, slightly caramelised slabs of delica pumpkin with whipped ricotta, which was exactly how pumpkin ought to be celebrated. It felt wrong to send any of it back to the kitchen, so I took the last piece home in a box and chopped it over salad for an evening snack. The overall mood that lunchtime was a little sedate, but I’m told more cocktails are drunk and the disco music is turned up of an evening. If that isn’t your thing, try lunch – and do try the tiramisu while you’re about it, too, because it is a wonderful, generous, boozy lump, and easily enough for two. And please do not be a fool and skimp on the homemade cannoli. Oh, I know what those are, you’ll think – they’re so often a disappointment. But here they are whopping great, crisp, deep-fried tubes stuffed with cream, salted caramel and chocolate sauce, and they are obscenely decadent. Yes, people might say Birmingham lacks a little by way of la dolce vita, but over in Harborne there’s a place where the imaginary sun shines just that bit brighter.

No, it’s “a journey of the senses”, over tandoori duck seekh kebab, sea bass pollichathu and a few fancy cocktails, to help you transcend your earthly confines. This is “more than just a meal; it’s an ascent to new experiences”, proclaims the website. Being a huge fan of restaurant hyperbole, I love it when dinner promises to change me metaphysically. The website goes on to refer to Vatavaran’s owners, chef Rohit Ghai and Abhishake Sangwan, as “visionary”, and in doing so strays perilously close to David Icke territory. Elsewhere on the site, Himalayan analogies are stretched like climbing ropes off the side of Nanda Devi: the show kitchen private dining room, we are told, is “a dynamic, participatory journey through the flavours of the mountains”, but I’d rather not – PDRs are the last refuge of the scoundrel, after all. Vatavaran is on multiple levels in a gargantuan, higgledy-piggledy former cocktail bar on Beauchamp Place; one server informed me randomly as I entered that “the loos are in the basement”, clearly preempting my later lostness. A great deal has been spent on abstract art and fancy wallpaper to make the place look pretty, though if this clonking behemoth of real estate were in Huddersfield rather than Knightsbridge, it would make a pretty good Wetherspoons. The menu, meanwhile, may claim to cover the Indian subcontinent, but the likes of beetroot chops and kidney bean kebabs seem far more modern and experimental than wildly authentic. The main dining room was a bit chilly, and our table for two was blasted further by an aircon vent that helpfully rearranged my fringe while I ate a stale trio of poppadoms with pleasant mango and tamarind chutneys; a whole £7 was added to our bill for that particular treat. At first, we were the only guests, but our server was flummoxed even by that. What puzzled me more, however, was the large, apparently out-of-operation cocktail bar through which all our food emerged. Was there a dumb waiter behind it, delivering plates up from the bowels of the building? At any rate, there was no smell of cooking at all, so for all I knew they were maybe ordering things in on Deliveroo. Two plates appeared over on the bar: first, that kidney-bean kebab, which turned out to be minced, unseasoned beans shaped into a patty, fried and garnished with cremated lotus root. It was grimly edible, but only if you were very hungry. Then a bowl of peculiar indori poha chaat in which wet, structureless dumplings were hidden in a tamarind sauce. Not offensive, but also not all that nice, either. Another small plate arrived, dal bati, a mixed lentil dal with hard bread balls. Bati should err on the chewy, but these were largely inedible and the haphazardly seasoned dal felt as if it had recently been reheated. Was there even a chef in the building? Granted, the earlier overcooked lotus root did suggest that someone, somewhere, had access to a fryer. I wrapped my scarf up tight and gestured amiably at the servers, pointing them to the air-conditioning unit that was still piping cold air at my neck. They looked at me blankly, without being quite able to crack my code. Two prettily presented non-alcoholic cocktails appeared with a flourish, so they clearly had a bartender in the house – a tej with Tajín, passionfruit and grapefruit, and a delicate tulsi made with cucumber, lemongrass, basil and apple. If only such artistry had extended to anything in the dining room. By this point in our meal, the place had started to fill with what seemed to be rich tourists pointed here by posh local hotels. “Save yourselves!” I stopped myself from shouting. “Run!” Fancy-pants places such as this make me rather irate, because they exist largely only in the meetings before their opening dates. “Behold, our extremely lofty cookery. Customers will be jolly happy to have us.” But by the time our mains arrived, I had lost all impetus for eating. A £24 tandoori lamb chop with black cumin was spongey, overcooked and suspiciously un-tandoored: there was no discernible charcoal smell, nor that unmistakable scent of sizzling lamb fat. Butter chicken, by contrast, was a safer option, and a welcome one, because it had a pleasing and vibrant sunset-coloured sauce finished with fenugreek. The accompanying roti, on the other hand, were stale and unlovable. I pondered a lot about Vatavaran in the days after our visit. Was there anything else I should have ordered? Fish cooked on a rotisserie (or so the menu said), or the lobster moilee? Then again, if even your dal is uninspiring, there’s no way I’m chancing you making a decent coconut-cream sauce to go with lobster. TLDR: Vatavaran may be a Himalayan dining experience, but I’d rather be rescued from the Mera Peak with missing toes than eat there again. Vatavaran 14-15 Beauchamp Place, London SW3, 020-4618 3971.

Snacks and small plates £5-£14, large plates £18-£29, desserts £9, wines from £36 Don’t Tell Dad in London’s Queen’s Park is a self-declared neighbourhood restaurant in a knowingly dishevelled neighbourhood. It sits on a part-cobbled, mews-style lane which was once home to stable blocks and very much looks like it. If you want to snoop at the red-rust frontage on Google Street View, however, you can’t. It’s a private street, through which Google’s cars may never pass. Lonsdale Road, once the property of the Church Commissioners, is now owned by a single landlord, Feldberg Capital, which is gently turning it into an ever-so-random-on-purpose leisure destination. Josh Katz’s Middle Eastern-influenced grill restaurant Carmel is here, as is the Australian-inspired Milk Beach and an outpost of Pizza Pilgrims, alongside a micro-brewery, a yoga studio, co-working spaces and a macrobiotic deli where they crochet their own fermented sea-vegetables. Perhaps I made the last one up. This reads like an eye-roll at the tastes of the infuriating, lotus-eating middle classes and the sort of businesses which pander to them. As I’m one of those infuriating people, I’m basically rolling my eyes at myself. Lonsdale Road has a lovely, rackety Copenhagen vibe and I would be thrilled if it were part of my neighbourhood. By day, Don’t Tell Dad is a bakery serving brown butter hazelnut croissant, and pear and whisky Danish, by head baker Keren Sternberg, formerly of Layla. By night it is a restaurant serving many other things. It fits in here perfectly. The restaurant was founded by local Daniel Land, the former banker behind quick-service pasta chain Coco di Mama, and is named in memory of his sister Lesley, who died suddenly not long ago. As a child, Lesley was always good for skulduggery of which their parents should know nothing. She came up with plans and urged her brother not to tell dad. It’s a sweet back story to a restaurant of innocent if serious pleasures; the kind only the most puritanical of fathers could find it in themselves to disapprove of. Anywhere which braises oxtail down until it is a sticky mess of uber-gravy-slicked meaty threads, tops a heap of it with dripping-fried breadcrumbs, and then puts all of that on a small crumpet and calls it a snack, is fine by me. A few years ago, perhaps pre-Covid, a restaurant like this in London would most likely have been found in what my kids call Central and I call the West End. (Sidebar: when did this change? How dare the young people come up with a name which makes so much more sense?) But the gravitational pull of the capital has shifted, from the middle to a little further out. Why drag into town if it can be avoided? It has the feel of somewhere you might stumble into and then out of again. There’s an open kitchen, soft lighting, cosy banquettes and booths, and a beautiful tiled floor, all of it picking up the colours from outside, as if bathing you in the glow of a guttering hearth. The orange ducted ceiling is, like the music, low (gentle club beats in the dining room; showtunes by the loos). Try to get a table, rather than a seat at a counter. The curve-backed stools look comfortable, but aren’t quite. No worries. An oxtail crumpet will quickly soothe the wriggling. Head chef Luke Frankie, formerly of Noble Rot and the Drapers Arms, has written a menu I’m going to call Cosmopolitan English: these are dishes which are both rooted very much in the here, but also reference over there. Among the small plates there’s an impressively deep-filled crab tart of white and brown meat in a thin, flaky pastry shell, spun through with green herbs, which tastes like something straight out of Jane Grigson’s cookbook English Food. But there is also a shuddering cairn of fritto misto which, with its inflated, glowing batter, is more Tokyo tempura than Italian antipasto. This one is announced as a fritto misto of winter vegetables, so you can feel good about your life choices, while celebrating the delicate art of deep-fat frying. There may have been slivers of squash and torn cabbage leaves hiding under the carapace. Who cares? It comes dribbled with a little honey, and dusted with chilli flakes. Abandon cutlery. This is work for fingers. As a foil against the fried goods, order the panzanella of impeccable, taut-skinned tomatoes with torn pieces of their own dense sourdough to soak up the dressing, topped with snowy fleshed fillets of fried sardine. It’s a summer afternoon on the beach, here amid a London winter. After which Don’t Tell Dad stops being one of those small-plates restaurants you’ve started whining to your tolerant friends about, and just serves up plates of dinner. A piece of sea bass, cooked so the bronze sear has edged deeper into the fillet, lies on a textured purée of nutty Jerusalem artichokes. Or there’s what amounts to the whole of a thumping mallard, complete with shot, for an extremely keen £28: both legs, slow-cooked then crisped, and both breasts, spiced, roasted and rested. Cooking wild duck like this isn’t something to which you can turn your hand. It takes experience to make sure it doesn’t tense up as it cooks, like a Mastermind contestant in the black chair. The skin is dark and rendered, and there’s a sweet carrot and date purée which is the ideal foil to the gamey meat. For salt there are bacon lardons. For greens there’s kale. Like the crab tart, there is something very English about it, a pleasing whiff of damp field and meadow under glowering skies. For dessert they offer madeleines. Make sure to leave time because, just as at St John where I first came across this proposition, they will be baked to order. I watch the tray being slipped into the oven. They arrive 10 minutes later, hot and crisp-edged, with a little orange cream to drag them through. The wine list by Bert Blaize, author of the book Which Wine When, is concise, big on bottles by small producers and has a good choice by the glass and 500ml carafe. Have one each. Daniel Land, responsible for feeding a lot of City workers, has talked effusively about now wanting to create something for where he lives: an adaptable space that changes through the day. The result may not always be cheap. It may feel like a neighbourhood restaurant for well-heeled neighbours. But that doesn’t change the fact that it’s a class act. Trust me, this is one you can mention to your dad, and anyone else for that matter. News bites The big news in the London restaurant world this week is the announcement that cult Leytonstone Thai restaurant Singburi will end its recent sabbatical by reopening in Shoreditch. The new venture, which has been described as Singburi 2.0, is a joint enterprise by head chef Sirichai Kularbwong (son of the original founders who have now retired), Nick Molyviatis of Kiln and Oma, and Alexander Gkikas of Catalyst. The new incarnation will open later in the spring. Meanwhile Shaun Moffat, formerly of Manteca in Shoreditch, and more recently of the Edinburgh Castle in Manchester’s Ancoats and then Maya, is staying in the city to open a restaurant called Winsome on Princess Street. It will, he says, serve ‘thoughtful British cooking’. He’ll be joined in the business by Owain Williams, one of the team behind Liverpool’s Belzan and more recently Medlock Canteen. The Midland Grand Dining Room at the St Pancras Renaissance Hotel, formerly the Gilbert Scott, is being taken over by Victor Garvey of Sola in Soho. ‘A dining room of this stature deserves a menu that matches its grandeur,’ Garvey has said, describing his plans for the room as ‘Old world, new ideas, to honour the foundations of classical French cuisine while embracing modernity.’ The opening menu includes tuna with white peach, duck with boudin noir and calvados apples, and guinea fowl with Armagnac prunes. Three courses will cost £75 and it opens on 25 February (midlandgranddiningroom.com).

But don’t let that put you off; in fact, I found the jeopardy rather exciting. Stark by Ben and Sophie Crittenden is the latest reprise of the pair’s former 12-seater in Broadstairs, Kent. The couple, seeking a better work/life balance, upped sticks here to the Côte d’Azur of Colchester, to open this brand-new Stark, which has slightly more covers (20 or so) and is, frankly, about as “independent” as a restaurant can get. We made the trek one Saturday evening, and were originally booked in for 6pm, until the Crittendens called to ask if we’d not prefer to eat later, because we’d be dining alone, a sweet attention to detail that only small operations such as this have time to pick up on (see also the Troublesome Lodger in Marlow). Stark’s premises are delightfully homespun, and err on the side of a glorified timber gazebo. There is no reception desk or cloakroom, no art installations, wine cave, private dining mezzanine or other such frippery. And at the back of this prettified shed, chef Ben works solo as an army of one. No sous chef, chef de partie, patissier et al: just a man and his pans, serving six courses methodically. He used to work at Michelin-starred the West House in Kent and competed on MasterChef: The Professionals in 2014 before opening the Broadstairs incarnation of Stark, which itself quickly gained a Michelin star; just last week, this Mersea Island manifestation retained that star. Expect the likes of pungent, earthy duck liver parfait served in a neat quenelle on a blob of rich onion marmalade, or a bowl of perfectly judged cod with mussels, or sea bass on a perch of caramelised fennel with a dainty prawn toast. Stark’s greeter, server, sommelier and occasional kitchen porter is Ben’s partner, Sophie, a calming, ebullient presence who you’d want on your side during a minor land battle. “Are you warm enough?” she asked as we settled in. Most restaurants in winter wouldn’t care if you ate in a bobble hat. The menu changes frequently, of course – you can do that when you’re a one-man band – and has in the past featured shh’annu lamb with aubergine, and seared duck breast with apple and hazelnut. Some will cough that these dishes are more like mouthfuls, but even the most faff-phobic diner would find it hard to quibble with a sublime portion of medium-rare Scottish beef fillet on a rich jus with a single yet exemplary confit potato and a neat blob of whipped horseradish. A bowl of whipped goat’s curd appears towards the end of dinner – but is it pudding or another savoury course? Who can tell? It’s cheesy, certainly whiffy, with layers of thinly sliced grape, micro herbs, pistachio cake and chopped pistachio. It’s also quite unlike anything I’ve ever been served. Crittenden makes fine produce the star of his show, then plates it up in curious, delicate, punchily flavoured pieces of art. There is a wine pairing for an extra £55 a head of French, Italian and Austrian wines. A grüner veltliner to match with the cod dish and a pale, sticky moscato to go with an artichoke and chocolate dessert. After a trying experience with an artichoke millefeuille, Charles has a vehement dislike of the annual winter “artichoke as pudding” season, but I adored this bowl of chocolate creme with candied artichoke, praline truffle and a scattering of chopped hazelnut. That was our final course of six, which we’d whistled through in about 90 minutes. The place was by this point full of Mersea Island’s great and good, many of whom were tackling the wine flight like troupers. “I bet the gossip that goes down in here is terrific,” I said to Charles. Stark is a gem. Some will scoff at its lack of airs and graces, at its minute team and at the fact that it’s a bit like eating in a summer house. But this very much feels like a restaurant opened on the Crittendens’ terms, in pursuit of that quasi-fantastical dream harboured by many hospitality veterans: how about if we opened a tiny place, and took away all those fussy, stressful bits of restaurateuring such as staffing, posh fit-outs and lengthy menus? Those things still feel necessary to climb ladders and grace fancy lists drawn up by tyre companies, but they can also turn a restaurant into a behemoth that gobbles up lives and turns the owner’s children into strangers.

I’ll break that down for you. “Robot”, as in the food is prepared by our new mechanical overlords. “Yakitori” is, essentially, meat grilled on small skewers – think tiny Japanese kebabs dipped in sauces. And then, of course, “restaurant”, as in that place where humans once had jobs before the robots took over. Bleeding robots, eh, clanking in here, taking our jobs? In fact, Yari Club’s “robot” sits in the window of the shop, seemingly to taunt passing Michelin-starred chefs who believe the world will cease to spin if these culinary gods are not up by 5am to source fennel pollen and beech sap. Real chefs can be a huge pain: pricey, sulky and fickle. But there are no such problems with the chef at Yari Club, because it’s a big stainless-steel box filled with hot oil. Despite that jaw-dropping, futuristic aspect being trumpeted loudly in all the marketing, this particular robot is, at first glance, hugely disappointing. Less robotic than I’d imagined (or hoped for) and more simply a deeply unattractive kitchen gadget. Skewers of chicken hearts, chicken gizzard, chicken wings and every other imaginable bits of a chicken are loaded on to a pulley, dragged through hot oil for a robotically precise number of minutes to make them succulent, then dipped into a special, sweet, soy-based sauce to finish. What was I expecting? One of the 1980s mime duo Tik + Tok wearing an apron and beckoning me inside to eat microchips in a repurposed spacecraft? No, but neither did I expect the robot to be simply a no-frills deep-fat fryer, or – and this is the kicker – for it to rely so heavily on humans to do its job. On the lunchtime I visited, Yari Club was almost empty, while Berwick Street market just up the road in Soho was absolutely heaving with lunch-hour workers queueing at its plethora of food trucks, or at the newish pizza spot Breadstall, where artisan slices of cheesy carbs are cooked and served by human hand. Oddly, there seems to be something about the big, spitty, oil-stained Yari Club robot that isn’t drawing the crowds. At first glance, Yari Club’s menu might seem a little limited, especially if you’re not in the mood for autopsied chicken on a stick, or to eat it in an unlovable, brown “cafe” space that’s about as cosy as the waiting room in a regional minicab office. In actual fact, however, there’s a lot to love about the food at Yari Club, although it will take a good 10 minutes to work that out, even with the help of a wonderful front-of-house person who pointed out the bento boxes, the katsu curries and the very moreish corn ball options, which turned out to be deep-fried clusters of spicy, crunchy sweetcorn, and completely irresistible. It took another server to point out the tsukune chicken meatball skewers, the mulled sake, the winter specials menu, the padrón peppers and the vegetable tempura. In fact, all the Yari Club’s robot experience does is underline quite how brilliant humans are, what with their opposable thumbs, patience and empathy, and how much hospitality needs them to survive. The Yari Club robot owes a great debt to real-life hospitality staff, because it can’t, for a start, process orders, load up its own skewers or put them on plates. It also can’t cater for vegans, it seems: one potential diner walked in, asked if the tofu scallion option could be cooked without touching chicken fat, was met with bemused looks and flounced out. In a normal restaurant, someone would have bargained with that customer, but robot yakitori not care about the flounce. All that said, the food at Yari Club is really rather good and, at about £3.80 for two skewers, very reasonably priced, too. The momo chicken thigh skewer, the classic negima chicken, the teba chicken wings and the prawn tempura are all undeniably delicious: crisp, juicy, tender, smoky when they need to be, and soft and sweet in other places. For all of £13.80, you can build a whopping bento box featuring six skewers, rice or salad, coleslaw, pickles, nori and more of the special-blend, umami flavour bomb that is Yari’s dipping sauce. The mulled sake, meanwhile, has all the whack of sake combined with the synthetic aspect of supermarket mulled wine mix; a migraine in a paper cup. They have Coedo Shikkoko black lager and oolong tea in cans, too, as well lots of nice Japanese teas. I’d go back to Yari Club for a snack, but it’s not really worth travelling out of your way for. There are more impressive robots at the Asda self-checkout. I have met our new hospitality robotic overlords and, as things stand, they still need our help.

It was more drunken argy-bargy than fisticuffs, but enough to count as floor entertainment. Sadly, no spats occurred on my recent visit to Satori, an enlightening Japanese restaurant in the same postcode, though that’s probably because it’s so dark in there – black walls, black floors, black tables – that its customers wisely choose to remain safely seated. But this is not a Dans Le Noir-style themed restaurant where you eat in a blackout; no, it has instead merely been designed by someone who clearly really loves shiny, black surfaces with blood-red trimmings and busts of dragons. It’s giving, as the kids say, 1980s MFI showroom doing international playboy lair. Or the time Adrian Mole painted over his Noddy wallpaper with black paint, but the gold hat bells kept gleaming through. Satori is inspired, the website says, by the Japanese concept of satori, a moment of “awakening”, and offers a dining experience “that transcends the ordinary and becomes a journey of discovery, flavour, and connection”. That’s a slightly pompous claim for somewhere that serves tuna and avocado maki, chicken wings, miso cod fillet and duck breast with honey and soy, but then pomposity chimed loudly in the air as we were led brusquely to our shiny table. We had ordered drinks from the small bar by the front door, a shiso fine made with Afsana Lion non-alcoholic spirit, red shiso and rhubarb and hibiscus tonic, plus a kendo made with Afsana Warrior, toasted rice tea, coconut water and sesame. Both sounded delicious, but they remained a dream because they never showed up. Did I maybe get off on the wrong foot with the front of house? Admittedly, there was a certain fractiousness from the moment I began ordering. “We’ll start with some sushi,” I said confidently. “The sushi platter?” our server replied, guiding us to the £30 option. “Well, how many pieces are on it?” I asked. “Twelve,” he said, tapping his pad. “And what then for starters?” “Do we need starters?” I asked, having already seen several platters of rather cumbersome-looking maki and nigiri pass by. “Yes, you’ll need starters,” he said, curling a lip. “Tea-smoked miso aubergine?” I said, hoping to placate him. “Karaage?” “And?” he said. “Can we order mains now?” I said, ignoring his rolling eyes. My request for the black cod at £35 and the £30 lamb cutlets seemed to persuade him that we weren’t just cluttering a table. A weird, dry, wilted cracker with spring onion and goat’s curd appeared as an amuse-bouche. Then a plate – black slate, naturally – topped with salmon and tuna nigiri dressed with rather thickly sliced okra and some caviar, and a slightly stodgy dragon prawn tempura maki topped with pea shoots. This wasn’t sushi worth making a special trip for, and pretty indistinguishable from the freshly rolled options at Waitrose. Next up came two thick slices of that tea-soaked aubergine, which was sweet, mushy and pleasant enough. Four small, thumbnail-sized pieces of karaage followed, which we’d been told had a layer of bonito under the drab, dry batter. Chopsticks were whisked away for our mains, which is when Satori ceased to push the boundaries of Japanese cuisine, ahem, and landed firmly in a 1990s UK pastiche of “sophisticated Japanese”, with a chunk of rather nice fish in a buttery miso sauce on a couple of pak choi leaves, and three deliciously plump, pink pepper-seasoned lamb chops with a few smears of yoghurt and some spindly heritage carrots, which owed more to Bengal than to Tokyo. This was the sort of dinner where you order dessert mainly out of sheer curiosity. “The baked Mount Fuji!” I declared triumphantly. Within a matter of minutes, and certainly not within time actually to bake anything, a chunk of matcha ice-cream ensconced in sticky meringue was on our table, a shot of whisky was hurled over the top and the whole thing was then set ablaze. At this point, semi-hysteria set in, although that might have been the whisky fumes. After the flames abated, the plate – black, of course – was a mound of singed, still moist meringue mix sitting on some melted ice-cream and a puddle of whisky. You really can’t put a price on that kind of excitement, although in this case it came to £12. Dinner was £168.77 including the warm service, but without the cocktails that, to date, are still being made in a very black room in Moseley. There wasn’t a fight in the restaurant, but my purse took a battering. Satori 2c St Mary Row, Wake Green Road, Birmingham B13, 0121-537 4166.

Starters £4.25- £5.95, mains £6.95-£12.95, desserts £1.50-£4, beers from £3.95 I can’t describe in detail how the upstairs dining room at Sharmilee in Leicester has changed since last I visited, but that’s not down to senility, not yet at least. After all, 26 years is quite a long time. The impressive young woman managing the restaurant today wasn’t even born when I came the first time. Back then, I wrote that it was decorated in calming shades of sandstone and noted a little decorative ironwork. Now the walls are a White Company shade of cream and there’s a mural of an Indian vista. It’s a comfortable, if functional, space. What matters is the extremely good value vegetarian Indian food, which I loved then and adore now. There’s an enormous, volcano-shaped serving of crisp, crunchy chaat, interlaced with dribbles of tamarind and yoghurt, around a warm, flaky samosa. There’s a dark aubergine curry, with dimpled pools of spiced oil across the surface that coat the mouth, and another of new potatoes, in a thick, lightly sour, tomato-based masala. I mop away at all of this with buttery rags of still-warm dosa, which comes with various chutneys and a small metal pot of restorative vegetable and lentil soup. Finishing it all will be impossible, because today I am alone. A lot will come home with me to my family. Lucky family. Sharmilee was the second restaurant I reviewed when I started writing this column in the spring of 1999 and it’s the only one of the first six that is still trading. The sports café Babe Ruth’s on London’s Finchley Road, the subject of my first review, is long gone and the small children who enjoyed going there for cheesecake may well now have children of their own. For this, my last column for the Observer, I have therefore returned to the very earliest place I could, to be a little reflective and annoyingly wistful. Amusingly, at least to me, that second column began with me recounting how I had been lectured by friends that too many restaurant reviews by the national critics were of shiny new London ventures “where the bill for an evening’s fun can easily match the national debt of a small African country”. You will forgive me, I hope, if I don’t now mount a detailed defence of my last quarter century’s travels. My family knows just how much time I have spent on trains. Certainly reviewing Sharmilee, established by the Gosai family in 1973, felt to me back then like a declaration of intent: that good food can be found anywhere and at almost any price. Downstairs is a counter selling Indian savouries and rainbow-coloured sweets or mithai. Upstairs is the restaurant where, in 1999, starters were £2–£3 and mains rarely broke a fiver. Given that starters are now about a fiver, and mains rarely break £8, I don’t think the bill has quite kept pace with food price inflation. Like Bobby’s across the road, it’s a stalwart of Leicester’s Golden Mile, launched to serve the city’s Asian community, but welcoming to so many others. It is unneeded proof of what a history of immigration to the UK has gifted us. We may not have the deep culinary culture of France, Italy or Spain. Instead, we’ve long had profound culinary breadth, by being open to the food of elsewhere. I have been lucky enough to travel the world by plate and bowl, from Afghanistan to Myanmar, from Bangladesh to Jamaica and all points in between, just by staying here. Long, intense essays, which are a little light on laughs, have been written about the importance of such restaurants as third spaces for these communities. All of this is doubtless true. I have read some of those essays and nodded sagely at the footnotes. But it’s never been a zero-sum game in which the profound virtues of small, cheaper places negate the massive pleasures to be taken in the shinier and the more expensive. I love a quality amuse-bouche, me; something topped with a ludicrous dollop of sparkling fish roe. I love a pre-dessert involving, say, sea buckthorn, and a little advanced praline frottage. I love all the esoteric bits in between. The fact is, I have long been a wet-lipped, weak-kneed, unashamed chef groupie, here for all of it. I may have insisted a little defensively over the years that mine is a writing job, not an eating job. That is true. But to do the writing bit, I have had to hang out in all those restaurants, good and bad, weird and wonderful, cheap and less so. I have been blessed with good fortune and I’ve tried not to take that for granted. Underlying this column has been one grand principle: that there must be space in life for fun because otherwise, what’s the point? For me, fun is going to a restaurant. I really am easily pleased. In the online age, which had not begun when I started, it has become obvious that some people find this whole business of people going to bloody restaurants and spending their bloody money on having a bloody nice time, an absolute outrage. How dare they? They have told me so vituperatively, below the line, via email and across social media. You do you, I suppose. The conversations with those readers with similar appetites to mine have, however, been so much more nourishing. You have shared with me your enthusiasms and recommendations, many of which I have followed. You have educated me, made me think and made me laugh, for which huge thanks. I could have done it without you, but it wouldn’t have been anywhere near as enjoyable. And I am, of course, indebted to the 1,300 or so restaurants I have reviewed, even the shockingly bad ones. You can learn a lot from a lousy night out. That’s not to make light of how tough things are right now for hospitality, but I have always written from the point of view of the diner. Which is what I am today, here at Sharmilee in Leicester. It really is worth your time. They serve great thalis and on weekdays run a buffet for just £10.95 a head. Do note the £3 charge for anyone who wilfully takes more than they can finish, to guard against food waste. Soon I’ll start writing a new restaurant column elsewhere. For now, though, it’s time for me to lay down my knife and fork and call for the bill. Thank you so much for reading. It’s been an honour. But it’s time for me to go. News bites Amsterdam-based food-delivery business Just Eat is being sold to investment company Prosus for €4.1bn, in a deal which the acquiring company says provides ‘an opportunity to create a European tech champion’. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Just Eat saw its share price surge during the pandemic, but it has been less successful since then. Prosus already has share-holdings in similar food-delivery companies based in Germany, China and India. The London-based restaurant company behind Gymkhana, Sabor and Speedboat Bar, among others, has signed a lease on what will be its first permanent site in New York. Last year, it launched a temporary residency for the Persian-inspired Berenjak brand at an outpost of Soho House in Manhattan. The new venture will occupy the ground and lower ground floors of 1245 Broadway, which is already home to various media companies, including A24 Films.

It has a Basque-born chef, Adam Iglesias, who has worked at Alameda near San Sebastián in Spain, as well as Brat, Barrafina and Sessions Arts Club in London. There you go: a plethora of foodie plus-points already. Then there’s the fact that it’s in a recently lavishly restored pub that feels a bit like an AI interpretation of the Queen Vic in EastEnders: there’s a horseshoe bar, traditional wooden panelling, ales on tap, lots of standing room, a big TV screen for the sport and … wait! What? An iced seafood counter? Well, that’ll be for the lobsters, carabineros, sea urchins and other fishy things to eat in the elegant, white table-clothed dining room just past the bar’s standing area. Possibly you’ll eat those urchins, or perhaps a devilled egg, topped with the Prince Arthur’s in-house caviar, sourced via the London Caviar company. This place goes big on caviar, with 50g of Siberian baerii served with turbot-dripping potatoes and creme fraiche priced at £100. You’ll have noticed that I have not called the Prince Arthur a gastropub, despite it clearly being gastronomical and being housed inside something resembling a pub. That’s because we need a new name for this type of highfalutin hospitality venture. With pubs across the UK closing at a rate of knots, the days of publicans rebranding as simply “one of them gastropubs” to survive are over. At one time, slinging a few £20 plates of beef cheek on polenta at customers and screwing a bottle of Aesop Resurrection hand soap to the toilet wall may have saved your soul, but not any more. Welcome to the bright new dawn of the turbo-bougie boozer. Yes, the Prince Arthur has the framework of a pub, with Jeremy Clarkson’s Hawkstone beer on tap and pig’s ear bar snacks and posh scotch eggs with mustard. But it is essentially a very sophisticated, Basque-influenced restaurant that serves txangurro crab, Galician beef rib and whole turbot with glossy, pale pil pil sauce, with torrijas and Basque cheesecake for afters. Please keep in mind that this is just downstairs; the new upstairs dining room promises to be even fancier. None of this, I must stress, is to my disliking. Ten minutes into lunch at this utterly lovable mega-posh pretend pub, and you will find yourself planning your return. From the first plate of gildas – skewered glossy olives, intricately folded anchovies and curls of green chilli pepper – I was smitten. These could be the world’s best pintxo gildas, living their best lives in a back street near Victoria coach station. Then two neat squares of those fish-dripping potatoes with sea urchin, tuna and caviar. The devilled egg is a work of art: a boiled egg standing upright on the plate, its yolk creamed and piped back into it, then topped with more caviar. Suffice to say that by this point the bill was creeping up alarmingly, even though I could have balanced everything I’d eaten up to then on the back of a credit card. For mains, we shared that turbot, which was perfectly cooked and came with a world-class pil pil emulsification. A side of winter greens was disappointingly over-salted, though. Much better was a plate of wood-grilled pepper, a slimy, smoky mass of sweet, vivid, red loveliness. The Prince Arthur is by no means cheap, but it’s worth it for a special occasion. The service is good, it’s in a beautiful room with a fascinating clientele of Belgravia locals who certainly don’t need to save the place for special occasions and, above all, the cooking is wonderful, especially if seafood is your thing. And, of course, there’s that cheesecake, one of my favourite desserts ever, though I usually only ever eat it in summer, ideally in San Sebastián itself, where the temperature lends itself to a wander around the streets, pausing to eat wobbly, custardy, melting cheesecake out of a box. The Belgravia version was 99% there, and came with a thick winter berry sauce and enough caramelisation that I could almost feel the northern Spanish sun on my face. There’s a lot to love about this restaurant, although, eventually, I fear, all surviving “pubs” will be like the Prince Arthur. House caviar on the menu, £25 a pop carabinero prawns on the grill, Sky Sports on the big screen, and anyone remotely normally waged standing outside in the cold, staring through the window like Hans Christian Anderson’s Little Match Girl, striking matches one by one while watching the world burn.

It serves modern European food and caters to the kind of audience who follow restaurant news in much the same way as others follow opera gossip or Formula One, and they’ll book out of sheer curiosity to experience this all-new, deeply chilled affair from Isaac McHale, chef/owner of the two Michelin-starred Clove Club nearby. We were led to believe that Bar Valette would not be at all like that well-known destination-dining spot. Not as formal. More come as you are. Clapshot croquettes (that’s mashed swede and potato, by the way), chicken in a basket, fancy fish with spuds, flan for pudding. The prices, however, aren’t informal at all and are very much still wearing tuxes, cummerbunds and spats. Small plates from £16 and snacks at £11. Want spuds with that? That’ll be £9, please. Watching the old guard of enfants terribles noughties Michelin chefs do “informal” is all rather fascinating. These people flew in the face of formality over a decade ago, chipping away at all the stuffiness and forlock-tugging, and making dinner at the Ritz seem like a prison sentence. Now those same chefs are opening places like Bar Valette to show us how to be truly relaxed while paying £11 for a bowl of kale. But, guys, how much more chilled can we get? While the Clove Club is in the rather grand Shoreditch town hall, Bar Valette is just a room overlooking a busy east London bus route. A glass-fronted room with brick walls painted white, a blackboard for wines and specials, and jars of chickpeas and white asparagus used as decor. We began with Vichy Catalan, at £6.50 per bottle, but, spotting that I was a non-drinker, they kindly offered to make me a non-alcoholic spritz with a shot of Sylva Padauk topped with soda. I notice only later that they charged me £18.50 plus service for the privilege. Two apparently complimentary devilled crab tarts appear – pretty unmemorable, but, hey, a gift … and added to the bill at £12. Fried boned chicken – reportedly bathed in buttermilk, though that might just be conjecture – is £14 and, in a nod to the Clove Club’s rabble-rousing era, comes in a basket and on a bed of pine branches. Fried Torbay prawns turn up, shell on and inviting us to crunch our way through their sweet tails and heads. For £27. A basket of perfectly nice swiss chard and ricotta barbajuans keep us happy while we chat, even though they’re £11. Gosh, we’ve spent some money so far at this draughty table near the door. For mains, fabada Asturiana arrives – a sticky pork and bean stew featuring blood sausage and belly pork – and then something curious happens: there is a lump of hard plastic in it, which my guest, mistaking it for some pork offcut or other, initially tries to eat before retrieving it from his mouth. “Oh God!” I mutter. “This will cause chaos.” That’s because this is an expensive restaurant, and while they may not be serious about, say, wallpaper, errors of this kind generally lead to kitchen staff offering to fall on their swords. So I brace for the rumpus. “Oh, I am sorry,” our server says, and whisks the offending item off to the kitchen. We wait. But no further word or explanation is forthcoming, and the stew stays on the bill. Alert, alert: in the smart, cool dining stakes, I think we may have hit Peak Relaxed Mode. No sane diner pines for the days of the special-occasion restaurant, where servers scowled while you fumbled over the 10 terrifying cutlery options. But the etiquette used to be that if a stew cost £26, someone would care if it contained miscellaneous plastic packaging. Two plump lamb chops “with spicy mayo” are up next, and at £11 a pop. Then some red mullet fillets with a green olive emulsion for – reach for your smelling salts here – £44. One large potato, sliced up and sauteed in duck fat, was £9. A lump of Stichelton with two figs was another £14. By this stage, we are £249 poorer for this experience. We exit, feeling a bit befuddled and glancing around for anyone who might care to say good bye, but Bar Valette is not the sort of place where people stand on ceremony. “Is the white asparagus in those decorative jars the same white asparagus that they have on the menu for £16?” my guest wondered. “If so, that’s fairly brass-necked.” It’s hard to say, but I do know that everything is informal here except the price.

Such as: can you really turn Korean kimchi into crisp fritters, in much the same way as the French make beignets with courgette flowers? Or can pork terrine, the centrepiece of any trad French pique-nique, be served with a Korean ssamjang, or fermented soybeans and hot pepper? Some people may say: “Heck, no”, but Cálong’s chef/owner Joo Young Won would disagree. Won was head chef at Michelin-starred Galvin at Windows for seven years, where he served reassuringly expensive French classics to a moneyed, West End audience who appreciated the tablecloths, prompt service and 28th-floor views of London. Here at Cálong, however, he’s bringing those Euro-dining techniques and flexing them with Korean influences in a pretty but mainly practical room. Cálong, which is very much an independent restaurant, has clearly passed the sniff test with Stokey’s feisty anti-gentrification crowd, who love to gather outside a Gail’s or a Nando’s and wield their Down With This Sort of Thing banners. Then again, it’s hard to take offence at something that’s so wilfully niche as a man serving French-style pressed brawn with bossam mooli, or hwangtae (dried pollock) croquettes with tartare sauce. This is not a Korean restaurant, but neither is it not a Korean restaurant. It is a melange, an experiment, a delicious, Korean-flecked hotch-potch. And, yes, kimchi can be turned into fritters, by the way. I know because I’ve eaten a large plate of them, and dipped them into a pleasingly fiery chilli mayo. To a less able cook, kimchi might prove a bit damp to batter and fry – after all, it’s like trying to do the same to coleslaw – but with Won’s ingenuity, these are just the right mix of funky, crisp and sating. At an earlier Cálong pop-up, he made kimchi risotto. Those dried pollock croquettes are also adorable: Alaskan pollock, frozen and dried in winter, which turns it a deep yellow (or hwang) shade, are mixed with fluffy potato, then breadcrumbed, fried and perched on a blob of tart, vibrant tartare. And, although there is nothing remotely groundbreaking about fried chicken with sweet chilli and peanut – fried chicken being fried chicken and all that – this was certainly a very good, crisp, thickly battered take. We lunched at Cálong on a Friday, half-expecting to be the only guests, because that’s the thing with semi-fancy neighbourhood restaurants: who on Earth uses them for lunch? Yet, by mid-service, every one of the dozen or so tables was full. Ladies lunching, gangs of friends, at least two dates. Then again, that’s the thing about gentrification: suddenly you’ve got folk who, at the drop of a hat, fancy a lunchtime onglet with mustard onions and greens for £26 with some sot bap for a further £12 on the side. Sot bap, or Korean claypot rice, is slightly sticky and very fragrant, and at Cálong that day Won made it with earthy mushrooms and brown butter. It’s possibly not £12-worth of exciting, but we live in the land of the pricey side dish these days; a more humble side of winter leaves with pear in a soy vinaigrette was £6. We ordered that onglet, and it was nothing short of fantastic. Griddled to a copper brown outside and medium-rare within, it came flanked by some crunchy brassica leaves. Also incredibly good was seafood jjamppong with aïoli, which was a bit like a spicy bouillabaisse and resplendent with langoustine, mussels and squid, and a vibrant orange, garlicky emulsion with enough bite to make your forehead sweat. There’s an awful lot to like about Cálong; it’s a cool, calm, confident restaurant, staffed by a youngish crew who are clearly not industry veterans, but who certainly know the menu backwards. Those hints of Korea among all the Frenchness may be subtle and sometimes almost moot – for example, the stracciatella with butter beans, AKA a bowl of cheesy beans, had only the merest hint of doenjang paste. But there’s still plenty enough spark, light, fire and crunch here to intrigue even Korean food enthusiasts. We finished with a blood orange chocolate crémeux, which was served sundae-style with layers of blood orange and a slightly bitter ice-cream made from roasted tea. Like so much else here, it seemed a strange idea that sounded as if it might just work, though at the same time perhaps wouldn’t, but in Won’s hands it turned out to be genuinely delicious. Cálong may not have panoramic views of the metropolis, but you can eat for half the price of Galvin and have a wander through Clissold Park and see the goat on the way home afterwards. In many ways, that’s just as good. Cálong 35 Stoke Newington Church Street, London N16, 020-3561 4798. Open lunch Fri-Sun, noon-2.30pm (Sun 3.30pm); dinner Weds-Sat, 6.30-10.30pm.

Which may explain why so much cash has been thrown at the area around the station to turn it into “an aspirational lifestyle destination”, rather than somewhere to stomp through grumpily while dragging a suitcase. By and large, however, this proposed glow-up has failed – the Euston Road will always be an unlovable, multi-laned traffic snarl-up – although now, if you creep into the Megaro hotel, you’ll find a minimalist Scandi restaurant, Voyage with Adam Simmonds. This plain, dark brown, oak-panelled room sits rather incongruously inside the recently restyled Megaro, which now has a Britpop, Austin Powers-esque, rock’n’roll theme and suites boasting names such as Groove Britannia and Pop Diva; Backstage Britannia comes complete with acid smiley face pillows. If the Megaro is a celebration of the 1990s London party scene, however, Voyage is a post-party detox in Gällivare, Sweden. Dinner is a five- or seven-course tasting menu of painstakingly prepped gastronomical visions. Take our first course, named simply “Oyster”. One word, no clues. Fancy, Scandi-influenced menus – and I have seen many – never reveal what you’re ordering, although the portion sizes are almost guaranteed to be minute, as if they’re designed to feed psychic hamsters. That “Oyster”, by the way, turned out to be something very delicious indeed: a bivalve mollusc from France with teeny-tiny flecks of compressed granny smith apple, white asparagus, wood sorrel and tapioca pearls, which a flurry of chefs in the open kitchen assembled meticulously with tweezers. Similarly, when Voyage’s menu reads “Sweetbread”, you can expect a single veal sweetbread perched on a delicate plinth of kohlrabi served two ways – raw and salt-baked – with a dash of onion puree, a pied mouton mushroom and a whisper of chicken jus in its yellow mustard seed sauce. Voyage’s journey might, to some diners, feel like a trip to a weight-loss camp, although admittedly we were on several occasions offered some good rye bread with whipped butter. Even so, you should expect dinner here to be light and dainty, so on no account take a fine-dining refusenik who will pine for a side of buttered spuds with the “Venison”. That aged venison comes with a slice of salt-baked beetroot, another slice of raw beetroot and a puree of spinach, parsley and juniper. Adam Simmonds spent his formative years at Le Manoir aux Quat’ Saisons, so his style was always heading towards the precise, refined, faultless and crisp. Voyage feels like a journey through all the various stoves behind which he has stood over a long career – at Le Gavroche, the Ritz and the Halkin, let alone the Lanesborough and L’Escargot. It takes thousands of hours in hot kitchens to cook like Simmonds does. For me, the highlight of our meal was “Celeriac”, a bowl of cubed, salt-baked, roasted and fermented celeriac with truffle, plus some pieces of shiitake mushroom and walnut, all finished with celeriac broth. Celeriac cooked in five different ways in a single dish is as time-consuming as it sounds, but it’s worth it for this level of vegetarian joy. Also stridently finickety was “Lobster”, in which a forkful of lobster meat sat in a clear broth with some razor clam and squid. Like all fancy hotel restaurants, Voyage’s clientele included several guests who had possibly ambled in hoping for a caesar salad and a side of fries and were now knee-deep in a Noma-style nosh-up. And if the celeriac and the lobster dishes had puzzled them, they hadn’t seen pudding yet. A bowl of pale smears and creams of varying textures eventually revealed itself to be compressed pear infused with tea and kombucha, some koji ice-cream and some chocolate ganache with a few chestnut drops and a hazelnut cream. Not over-sweet and, in fact, by some interpretations of the word, not really dessert at all. Voyage is not for everyone, sure, but others will love it. The service is warm, knowledgable and determinedly proud of Simmonds’ hard work, and they sent us on our way with delightful rosebud tea bags that had the look and feel of something I might have made at Brownies. These were packed into a homemade envelope, complete with a letter from Simmonds himself, and sealed with wax at the table, as if they were issuing me with a medieval death warrant. None of this, as far as I remember it, felt remotely normal at the time, and the whole experience becomes even weirder in its retelling. Voyage is definitely a trip.
